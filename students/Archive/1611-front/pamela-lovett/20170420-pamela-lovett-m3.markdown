## A: End of Module Assessment

Evaluator: Taylor Moore/Brenna Martenson

Pending

## B: Individual Work & Projects

By and large, the self-directed personal project that we took on at the end of the module made a huge difference in my growth. Although there are definite benefits from having paired projects - there is a lot that can be said about owning your project and going at it alone. I loved it.

Individual Projects:
* Check Your Tone

###Check Your Tone

* [GitHub URL](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/thatPamIAm/check_your_tone)

#####Description: Implementation of a self-directed project that solved an actual problem.

Evaluator: Taylor Moore & Brenna Martenson

#####Scores:

Passing

## C: Group Work & Projects

Group Projects:
I completed 3 group projects this module:

* Headcount2.0
* SwapIBox
* MovieTracker

### HeadCount2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kfarias/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

#####Description: HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.

Evaluator: Brenna Martenson

#####Specification Adherence

2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 of the features outlined in the specification above.

#####Code Quality

2 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not use them as intended. Significant refactoring necessary.

#####CSS Design

2 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad.

#####Testing

2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

###SwapIBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Obleo33/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

#####Description: For this project, we worked on developing some muscle memory building out React components. Implemented The Star Wars API.

Evaluator: Brenna Martenson

#####Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.


#####Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

#####Design

3 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

#####Testing

2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

###Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tbrandle/MovieTracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1611/mod-3/movie-tracker/hugh_pam_tim_kenia.md)

#####Description: For this project, we worked on developing some muscle memory building out React components. Implemented The Star Wars API.


#####Specification Adherence

4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

#####Redux Architecture

4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

#####Router

4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

#####Javascript style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#####Testing

2: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

#####Workflow

4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each otherâ€™s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

## D: Professional Skills/Development

### Gear Up Reflections

[MicroAggresions]

I enjoyed this particular gear up session and can honestly say that I'm glad to attend an institution where these kind of topics are addressed. The only unfortunate thing about this particular gear-up is the fact that the people who would benefit the most from these sessions (say those who might be aggressors) tend to dismiss these topics altogether. So I'm not sure how else an open dialogue could be successfully achieved - but this session was a good start.

[Grit - repeat]()

Although this was a repeat session on grit, I actually thought it was a good topic to revisit as a cohort. With there just being a little over a month left in the program, it was great to revisit definitions of grit and come together with students across cohorts and mods.

[AI Automation]

I think the Mod4 students did a good job of orchestrating good discussions around the future of AI. It was interesting to hear such a wide variety of responses coming from our gear-up, especially since I assumed responses would be a bit more identical, coming from a group of people who are all setting out to work in tech as programmers.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

####to Timothy Brandle(Movie Tracker, UX/UI Challenge)

I had the opportunity to work with Tim for a paired UX/UI project as well as a larger project where a group of us implemented React, Redux, and Router 4 in an application. Without a doubt, Tim is one of the hardest working students in our cohort.  He has a deep passion for solving problems and an insatiable curiosity, which is both admirable and contagious.  Tim is one of the first persons whom I seek out when I need assistance with my work, which is largely due to the characteristics I have named and his excellent communication skills.

Tim should continue to reach out for help from those who can give him nudges in the right direction when he may be stuck with a problem for longer than usual. He has sometimes hesitated to do so in the past (which is feedback I gave to him while doing our group project). Since giving him this feedback initially, I have seen him change his strategies and reach out to those around him more.


####to Hugh Morrison(Movie Tracker)

I think one of Hugh's greatest strengths is his willingness to seek out and embrace challenges. This became clear both when I worked directly with him during our group project in Redux, but also while I watched him hacking away on his self-directed personal project for this module. When Hugh sets his mind to reach a goal he is, quite literally, unstoppable. It's refreshing and inspiring to be around programmers who have the level of drive that he does. Beyond all of this, Hugh is also a thoughtful, light-hearted, relaxed individual - which I find equally refreshing.

One piece of constructive feedback I would give to Hugh is to speak up more in class, as I believe others would definitely benefit from hearing his thoughts and opinions on the material we are covering.

####to Kenia Farias(Headcount2.0, Ember Island, Movie Tracker)

I had the opportunity to work with Kenia on three different projects during this mod: HeadCount2.0, Ember Island, and Movie Tracker. Throughout the entirety of each project, Kenia was a patient, engaging, and thoughtful partner. It was clear that she was truly invested in both my learning and her own - which I've found is not necessarily a common trait to come across when pairing with others. Her ability to get things done and keep pushing forward is admirable, and I look forward to working with her more in the future.

### Being a Community Member

####from Tim Brandle(Movie Tracker, UX/UI Challenge)

You were great to work with on both projects. You were willing to carry a lot of weight for the ux/ui project in the beginning which was really appreciated. I think you are a great communicator and you have a positive energy that helps group moral during 14 hour work days. constructive feedback: I think you should be more confident in your programming skills. I think your skill level is higher than you may think. Overall great experience!

####from Hugh Morrison(Movie Tracker)

Working with pam was an absolute breeze. She is tenacious and gritty in the face of uncertain odds and is comfortable tackling complex nuanced problems using innovative approaches . She is chilled out and wonderful to collaborate with. i look forward to working with her in the future.

### Playing a Part

I continued to attend IronFe most mornings and continued my term as the SAB representative for this module.
