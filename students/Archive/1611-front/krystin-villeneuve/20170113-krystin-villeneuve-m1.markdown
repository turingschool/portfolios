-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

## Object Oriented Programming Assessment
## Evaluator: Louisa

## Notes:

Good job! A little softer on the JS foundations than I expected, understands syntax but needs to be sure to review/solidify the basics moving forward.

## Rubric

### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### JavaScript Problem Solving

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity, and can effectively leverage documentation

### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

## DOM Assessment
## Evaluator: Robbie

## Notes:

* A little hesitant on JS and jQuery mixing (doing math with JS and not using jQuery...), but overall good.
* Jumping far ahead in terms of functionality - want to see a more granular breakdown of the problem, testing assumptions along the way (using `console.log`).

## Rubric

### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Number Guesser
### Evaluator: Louisa

* [Number Guesser](https://github.com/krystin987/numberguesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.
Phases 1-3 = MASTER branch for evaluation.
If you elect Phase 4, create a separate branch for that work.

### UX/UI Expectations

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

### Functional Expectations

- 3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

### Fundamental HTML

- 2:  Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.

### Fundamental CSS

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### Fundamental JavaScript

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Linked List

* [Linked-List](https://github.com/juliankyer/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

### Evaluator: Louisa

### Notes:
Very nicely done, NO GLOBAL VARIABLES! JS very concise, small focused functions. Well done. Main docking of points was from small details around syntax that will become non-issues with experience. Nicely balanced JS and CSS writing between the pair.

### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### Workflow

- 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.


#### Idea Box

* [Idea Box](https://github.com/thatPamIAm/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

### Evaluator: Robbie

### Notes:

  * Filter was not working, but implementation was close (jQuery each)
  * Good conversation in GitHub, but more of it, especially in the PR descriptions
  * Good JS - continue refactoring and breaking out logic into smaller, more readable functions

### Specification Adherence

* 2.5 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outlined in the specification above.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 2:  Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Collaboration

* 3 - Team members employ PRs and [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.


#### Game Time

* [Game Time](https://github.com/krystin987/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

## Evaluator: Louisa

## Notes:

### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

### User Interface

* 3.5 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

## Julian Kyer - Linked List Project Partner

What I liked about working together:

You always came with a positive attitude and a great sense of humor - I appreciate that in ANY working relationship.

What did you find challenging about working with me?

Remote pairing - we didn't do a whole lot of it, I would have liked to use github a lot more earlier on instead of waiting to meet up. BUT, we were all still a bit freaked out on version control at that point.

What do you see as my strengths/weaknesses?

You have great ideas - you see things from a creative perspective and you stick to your guns when you feel strongly about a given approach. This is always going to take you pretty far, just don't let it make you lose sight of what's important in a project in the long run.

What do you think I can improve on?

Trust your partner/team a bit more. Some ideas or concepts may seem abstract at first, and that can be really uncomfortable - embrace more of that discomfort (I bet you already are).

Anything else you'd like to add?

In the pairings I've been assigned, I have learned to appreciate the small conflicts that help us move forward. I felt the way we handled ours was top notch - instead of dividing, we became a more united front. I was super impressed with us. Tension and discourse is always going to happen, we'll see WAY worse as we progress as developers. I think we're off to a great start.

## Pamela Lovett - Idea Box Project Partner

You are determined, dedicated, you have a ton of grit, AND seemingly limitless energy. You came in early, stayed late, weekends - even when feeling under the weather. During our project, we put in a LOT of hours - many of which were spent scratching our heads! Our collective ability to never flip out in frustration was pretty impressive - we kept the overall tone light and humorous. I enjoyed the time we spent working together a lot, no matter how much we wanted to pull out our hair.

You can be more direct with others, especially when you want to test an idea don't hesitate to go rogue and test out a bunch of things. Version control shall set us free.

## Rebecca Holt - Game Time Project Parter

Positive feedback about our pairing:
You are tenacious and willing to try things that might be scary - like making Tetris! (RIP Tetris). When you set out to tackle a given feature, you make it work, and you celebrate the small victories that lead to the whole. This is a successful strategy in any project!

Constructive criticism about our pairing:
Try to trust you teammates a little more on things that seem abstract at first. It's OK to read the code around you, especially our peers.

Additional comments:
As a team, I think we'll finish this game project pretty strong. When we ran into tension and discourse, we both illustrated our perspectives, read through the code together, made some fast compromises and kept moving forward. The tensions will happen, we handled it really well.

### Being a Community Member

## Julian Kyer - Linked List Project Partner

Positive:

You aren't afraid to try a bunch of things out and see what happens. You move a team along and keep things fresh with new ideas.

Needs Improvement:

Be mindful of the fact that you might work quickly for some. Not necessarily a bad thing, but your pace can be really fast.

## Pamela Lovett

Positive:

Krystin has a high level of self-awareness, which I find is not typical for many people. She is open and honest with herself and others about her biggest strengths and weaknesses, which I believe will serve her well during her time at Turing and beyond. Even though each of my project pairings have been successful in helping me grow in different ways, I can honestly say that my pairing with Krystin made the most difference in how I approach my work now. While discussing and "defining" our relationship for our paired project, I made it clear to Krystin how uncomfortable I have been with "driving" and "breaking" code on the fly... and how I thought this might be stunting my development. During our entire pairing Krystin not only honored my desire to take the extra time to really understand how our code was working, but she also forced me to drive more than I would have otherwise and constantly encouraged me to "break" my code.

Needs Improvement:

I believe Krystin could benefit from taking more short breaks while working on projects. She is pretty good at doing this currently, but can sometimes get very involved and forget to giver herself some room to breathe.

## Rebecca Holt - Game Time Project Partner
Positive:

You are hard working and have drive that is contagious. Your determination is inspiring. You're great at utilizing the resources you have around you -- keep that up!

Needs Improvement:

Sometimes you can be a hard ball which is great when working on projects but can also be somewhat hindering for group work.


### Playing a Part

I participated in the hackathon during the second week of the session at Turing. Tomasina and I made a hilarious concept site about sending old tech to the third world.

When Casey asked for volunteers to go to Arvada and teach elementary students about arduinos I was on board, even though I had never touched an arduino in my life - let alone hooked one up to my computer to teach someone about. It went well. This is the kind of stuff I started developing to do.

I plan to become more involved in giving access to children to code as well as using development to improve society in general, so I joined the Pahlka posse.

### Gear Up

### Professional Development Workshops

## Grit

The grit workshop was like a doorway to Bucketisms. Everyone should listen when Bucket starts talking: he drops random, valuable wisdom bombs - but you'll miss them if you aren't listening.

## Introvert/Extrovert

It's not always easy to think of ourselves in these kinds of relative terms. I exist in the center of these and I try to exploit that every chance I get.

## Growth Mindset

This was my favorite workshop. This mindset is vital in all facets of life. I learned about this when I first went to college after the army. I had to begin math training way back at remedial pre-algebra. I felt 'stupid' and considered not pursuing it any further, but I still took that first pre-algebra class. Then I took another math class, and another, and another. I learned I was never bad at math, I was just behind, and that was easily fixed - and most other things work the same way. It's life changing.
