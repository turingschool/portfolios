# Devin Dixon - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to learn a brand new skill and to meet new and interesting people,
that would later turn into great friends and colleagues. I wanted to excel at
learning and retaining the material, and have Mod 1 be the first stepping stone
to being a great programmer.

### B: Individual Work & Projects

Number guesser was our first solo project and a great challenge to test our understanding

### Number Guesser

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/devlikesramen/number-guesser)
[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

####Evaluator: Robbie

####Rubric

####UX/UI Expectations
1. 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

####Functional Expectations
2. 3.5: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

####Fundamental HTML
3. 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

####Fundamental CSS
4. 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

####Fundamental JavaScript
5. 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax


###C: Group Work & Projects

####Projects

Mod 1 had three paired projects: Linked List, Idea Box, and Game Time

###Linked List

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/Obleo33/linked-list)
[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List is a site to store a list of website links

####Evaluator: Robbie

####Notes:
1. Too many media queries in CSS, one or two less could have been possible
2. Well refactored JS code, like the small functions and use of function reference in event listener
3. Git workflow needs work: more conversation, commenting, and equal contribution of the code base in terms of languages (one person doesn't do all the CSS or JS and visa versa)

####Rubric

####UX/UI Expectations
1. 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

####Fundamental JavaScript Style
2. 3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

####Workflow
3. 2.5: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

####HTML Style
4. 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

####CSS Style
5. 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.


###IdeaBox
[GitHub Url](https://github.com/hmorri32/idea-box)
[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Ideabox is a site for storing and rating ideas

####Evaluator: Bree

####Rubric

####Specification Adherence
1. 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

####HTML Style
2. 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

####CSS Style
3. 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

####JavaScript Style
4. 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

####Workflow
5. 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

####Collaboration
6. 2 - Team members shared equitably in the workload, however there are only a few pull requests, which are not labeled or documented very well.


###Game Time (Connect 4)
[GitHub Url](https://github.com/devlikesramen/game-time)
[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Game Time is a fully-functional game using HTML5 Canvas and Javascript

####Evaluator: Robbie

####Notes:

1. Need more testing for game "collisions" before testing can be a 3 or above
2. Break out the game logic (check right, check left, ...) into it's own object so it can be tested
3. Some good efforts for refactoring, but there is some repeated code
4. Hard coding numbers based on canvas dimensions - not good for changing canvas dimensions

####Functional Expectations
1. 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

####User Interface
2. 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

####Testing
3. 2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

####JavaScript Style
4. 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

####Workflow
5. 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

####Code Sanitation
6. 3 - Five or fewer complaints


###D: Professional Skills

###Gear Up

  [Grit Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
  1. I found that our last gear up on grit is really helping me out in my current
  situation. Repeating a module was never part of my plan, and now that I am, it's
  hard to not feel ashamed of myself. Grit is something I'm going to need to
  implement more of as take a different approach to applying myself in this next
  module. I need to persevere and remain passionate about my end goals of being a
  great developer, and this setback doesn't mean that I give up or that I'll never
  get there. It just means that I'm not there yet, and that I need to work even
  harder to make sure I'm taking strides towards my goals.

###E: Feedback and Community Participation

####Giving Feedback
####Feedback for Franklin Crosby

1. Franklin is a great team player and collaborator. He communicates often and effectively, and makes sure that his teammates are comfortable with the direction the project is going in. He encourages new ideas and supports trying new approaches to the tasks at hand. He makes sure that whenever he completes a step, that his partner understands how he got there and the methods he used. He is overall a great person to be around and work with. One area that maybe could use improvement is communicating more often when remote, but even then it wasn't at all an issue when I worked with him.

####Being a Community Member

####Feedback from Jon Willemain:
1. I was very excited about the opportunity to pair with Devin for game-time, he is a very intelligent individual and has a lot to offer his partners. He would show me is CSS static comp challenges and  I remember how impressed I was with the way they turned out.

2. Devin needs to be more confident in his problem solving abilities. I feel like he gets overwhelmed and gives up on a problem too easily, which is understandable considering the way we have learned through traditional schooling.

3. Like a lot of people in this program, I think he has the opportunity to be a very good programmer if he continues to work hard


####Playing a Part

1. Now that I'm repeating mod 1, I would like to submerge myself more into the
community and take advantage of all Turing has to offer.

####Final Review

RETAINED: repeating M1
