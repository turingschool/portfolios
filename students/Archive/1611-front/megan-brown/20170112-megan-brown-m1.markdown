# Megan Brown - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal was to gain entry level of knowledge and understanding of basic html, css, and javascript principals. I feel like I was able to do that, but need more practice in writing code, and critical/logical thinking. I am concerned about staying in practice while I am taking the next module off and would love to have some guidance as to how to keep moving forward in my learning while not physically being here at Turing.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I was really stoked about sausage party. It was my first big hurdle that I overcame here at Turing. I felt super lost in being tasked with creating a website from scratch having never attempted one before and to be honest my first attempt at dog party was for lack of a better term dog shit. So I went back and refactored my awful dog party and created sausage party. And even though it is rudimentary I am still proud of it because it signified the beginning of my Turing Journey and the keep hammering attitude that has persisted with me since.

#### SAUSAGE PARTY & NUMBER GUESSER

[sausage party love.](https://brobear.github.io/sausageParty/)


[number guesser](https://brobear.github.io/numberGuesser/)
my first project. it was weird i wasn't very conscientious of the rubric or being evaluated. I don't think the project oriented learning point had sunk in. In hind sight i think that i would have done it all different, and focused more on details and conventions talked about in class.

Evaluator: Louisa

UX/UI Expectations

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.
Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three
Fundamental HTML

* 2.5: Naming conventions are inconsistent.Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
Fundamental CSS

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
Fundamental JavaScript

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax



## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This module I worked with Marissa on linked-list, Michael Fennwick on idea-box and built GameTime by myself.

#### LINKED LIST

[Linked List](https://brobear.github.io/linked-list/)

Working with Marissa was awesome and kicked off the paired projects showing me what it is like to have an awesome partner. I enjoyed working on linked-list and found the challenge appropriate for our current learning level.   

Evaluator:Bree

Functional Expectations

* 3.5: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.
Fundamental JavaScript Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
Workflow

* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
HTML Style

* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
CSS Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### IDEA BOX

[idea box](https://brobear.github.io/ideaBox/)
this was a cool project that had us expand on the principles of linked-list. i was grateful that Marissa and i built linked-list in jquery, because it gave Michael and i a leg up on building ideaBox.

Evaluator: Louisa

Notes: Michal was an amazing partner and a wealth of knowledge. He was a superb partner and a true pleasure to work with. I feel lucky having had him as a partner. His help and guidance through this mod was a blessing.

Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
HTML Style

* 3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
CSS Style

* 3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
JavaScript Style

* 3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
Collaboration

* 4 - Team members leverage GitHub to have discussions about their solutions, track tasks/issues, and showcase a clear workflow process in their use of PRs.

#### GAME TIME 

[game time](https://brobear.github.io/GameTime/)
## Evaluator: Louisa

## Notes:
Struggled to divide work as a pair, the weight of the project fell to Megan.

### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

### User Interface

* 3.5 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Code Sanitation
No JSHint in the project code, they tested in the JSHint browser interface. It's ok.



## D: Professional Skills
I made a linkedIn and a resume.
I also attended gear ups on growth mindset, introversion/extroversion, and grit.
I also participated in the StrengthsFinder development.

### Gear Up

I really loved the growth mindset workshop. It came at just the right time, when i was really losing my shit over the intensity and change that had come with beginnig Turing. It really helped me to calm down and focus on building my skills instead of freaking out when things weren't going well. It made me also really be enamored with Turing for having the forethought to do that Gear Up at that exact time. I wasn't as enthralled with the introvert/extrovert gear up but it was nice to see that all parts of that spectrum are present at Turing. The Grit workshop was interesting to have, gave me something to think about. Passion vs Drive/Drive+Passion = Grit. I did feel like it was a bit buzzy, but i guess that is tech.

### Playing a Part
I've made an active effort to interact with everyone in our cohort. I enjoyed joining the mod out for drinks on fridays, and had a great time getting to know people outside of the Turing bubble. I really enjoyed the Bezos posse and in future mods look forward to being a more active member of the posse. Entrepreneurship is a big reason as to why i am here so i look forward to more posse time.

I really enjoyed the improv class offered. The speaker who spoke about beginning her own tech/finance business, was my favorite over the course of the mod. In the future i hope there are more front end speakers and tech entrepreneurs who come to speak at Turing.

I also look forward to finding a mentor and will follow up on Allison's recommendations for meet-ups and mentorship.
