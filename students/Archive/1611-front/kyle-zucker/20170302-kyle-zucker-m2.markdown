## End of Module Assessment

### OOP TDD Eval
Evaluator: yung-jhun

Did ok! Passed 


## Work & Projects

Here are some dope things I've done this Mod

#### JS foundations 

##### Complete Me

Passed

This project involved building and basic implementation of a trie data structure. I feel I solidified my ability to use recursive functions. 

1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

2. Enumerable & Collections

3.5: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

3. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

4. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

5. Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

##### Sorting Suite

Passed 

This project involved creating 3 different sorting suites. Merge sort was by far the largest chunk of the project for me. The recursive function introduced with the Merge really expanded the possibilities of coding for me. I really enjoyed being able to have my algos compete with each other via testing.

1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
2. Test-Driven Development

4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Functional Expectations

3.5: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

##### Flash Cards

Passsed

Loading text files in the browser is weird. I enjoying expanding into the cmd line interface, which is not a thing I feel is typically done with js. 

1. Fundamental Javascript & Style

3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
2. Enumerable & Collections

4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
3. Test-Driven Development

3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.
4. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.
5. Functional Expectations

4: Application fulfills all expectations of iterations 1 - 5 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality as well as an extensions.

#### 2Do-Pivot

Redo that old stuff. Had a great time figuring out closures with Tim. 

Evaluator: Y-J

Comments:

Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
Accessibility

2.5 - The application shows glimpses of good accessibility practices, but fails to deliver a truly accessible product. The application has 4-6 aXe-core violations
User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations
HTML Style

3 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
JavaScript Style

3.5:- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Utilization of es6

3.5 - Developer has used one new es6 feature in their code. Developer should be able to speak to what the feature does and why it improves the code for future developers. Developer has zero instances of mismatching es5 and es6 style in any specific file.
Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.
Workflow

3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.


#### Weatherly

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Built a React app! Had to weather this one on my own. This project threw a ton more at me then I expected, it was great.

Evaluator: Meeka

Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface

Minor Bug: When entering a zipcode and then tabbing into an autocomplete option - then I have a 1 click lag on submitting when I hit enter. Same behavior does not happen when ignoring the autocomplete suggestions.

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

HTML Style

3 - Score bumped to a 3 after this post eval PR submitted

** Previous **

Developers switched over to divs quite a bit - html is laid out semantically.

Would recommend going through and switching to semantic html instead of divs.

If changes made, will bump to 3.

Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.

CSS/Sass Style

4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Testing

2.9 - Score bumped to a 2.9 after this post eval PR submitted

Notes from PR review:

Sweet! Good work.

For the testing, to bump the score to a 3 I would still really want to see some juicier testing. I think this is basically the 'bare minimum' -- which is a huge improvement, but something that you need to keep an eye on continuing to grow as a developer.

Great submission, very professional - thank you for taking my feedback seriously!

** Previous **

Data wrapper or some kind of logical code should be broken into a js file and unit testing.

Should have a test file per component with at least one test.

Make sure you don't have other components testing in random files.

Make more use of the test data.

If you get a pull request in to fix those things, will ammend score.

2 - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

Code Sanitation

3 - Score bumped to a 3 after this post eval PR submitted


## Professional Skills

### Project Management Tools - Reflections

As a previous project manager, I've been tinkering with PM tools for some time. Honestly, I'm intentionally not emphasising my PM skill set as well it's something I technically can do, I do not want to be roped into a path that sends me back into PM work. 

That said, knowledge of indiviudal/small group PM techniquies is useful. I used Waffle.io for the first time this Mod, and found the tool to be very useful. Ultimately, I don't want to be responsible for PM activities, but Waffle's github integreation makes the tool useful for personal use.

### Professional Development Workshops

### Gear Up
#### UBI

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

This workshop discussed the concept of UBI and consider the possibitlity of UBI in our society. I'm already a huge proponent for a UBI system so I enjoyed talking about the subject. Honestly I was a bit surprised to see UBI as a gear up topic but I'm glad that, at the very least, the concept is spreading. I'm very sad that our Gear up schedule was messed up and we did not get to participate in the automation gear up, as I feel the topics in that discussion would have been helped make the case for UBI.

### Flower Exercise 

Favorite People to Work with: 
- I enjoy most people, and feel working well with all is a better approach than trying to shelter yourself from people. Ultimately I prefer to work with folks with a similar drive in intensity and effort.

Transferable skills: 
- My communication skills work all over the place

Favorite Working Conditions: 
- I work best around good people

Prefered Pay and Responsibility: 
- I don't care much about money, but I need a liveable wage. I'll take on any level responsibility

Prefered Location: 
- Denver or out-side US ideally. 

My Values and Goals: 
- I believe we are one organism on one planet. I'd like to share that view as I can. 


### Mentor

Allison's session was very help for me to get my mind straight on getting myself a mentor. I've reached out to Horace and plan to touch base with a few other mentor's that I'm interested in. 

## Feedback and Community Participation

### Feedback Recieved

We had a very productive pairing session with Kyle. We first discussed the problem and then brainstormed ideas on how we could solve it. Kyle didn't provide me with an answer but rather directed me to resolve the task myself. I feel like I learnt a lot while working with Kyle.

The way in which you help during pair sessions is really useful. You didn't push our group down any one path but really allowed us to figure out the details. Also, when it came to helping you pointed us to docs and let us work through that which is more beneficial than just out right saying 'do this' or 'do that'.

### Feedback Reflections

I feel that my personal feedback response handling was fairly matured before coming to Turing. I've had to deal with characters far more intense than. 

### Being a Community Member 

This mod, with the help of the Lab posse leaders, I ran a Friday spike on curcuit bending. The participants were engaged and seemed to enjoy the experience, which I personally see as a sucess. I echo my statement from last mod: I greatly value my relationships will everyone in the Turing community and made it a point to establish as many positive relationships in this mod. I feel satisfied with my involvement.
