Personal notes: 

I set the bar too high for myself and burned myself out by looking up the mountain instead actually climbing it. But I'm pretty stoked to have a base to continue with post-grad.


#### Turing Overflow

Partner: Staci, Mike

Evaluator: Rob

Score: Passed

Full Notes: Ask Robbie!

Personal notes:

Project experience was the closest to 'real work' that I've had so far at Turing. It was great to give birth to something together with a good team. 


#### wbwr - Electron

Passed! 

Personal notes: 

Fun project. I enjoyed going into something new/different. 


### D - Professional Development Workshops

Big fan of the detailed post-grad job plan. I've felt the need to do something at that level for awhile now and it's great to have a plan I'm confident about. I also appreciate the push for outreach and connection forming. 


#### Gear Up
##### UBI Leadership

I enjoyed leading the gear up with my group. UBI is something I've been supporting and it was nice to share that with other students.

### E - Community Participation

I continued my reign as SAB rep. I also continued to pair with students below me. Demo night and Code fair participation was fun and I hope my small part can help continue the tradition.
