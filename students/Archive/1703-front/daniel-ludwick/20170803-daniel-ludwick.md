# (Bucket Ludwick) - (M3) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
  I feel dearranged. Not sure What I've accomplished. I get redux/react. I still don't get testing or CSS. Both of those still elude my grasp.

 (evaluation comments)
 * Iteration 0:
* Pull in movie API
* Pull most recent movies from MovieDB API.
* Display each movie on root index /

Iteration 1:
* Sign In / Sign Out Functionality
* Be able to sign in on page /login and redirect user to /
* Flash "Email and Password do not match" - if password is incorrect
* Ability to create a user.
* Flash "Email has already been used" - if email has been taken
* Should only take legit emails - regex - Extension

Iteration 2: Favorites
* Each movie should be displayed with a favorite button.
* If the user is not signed in and clicks on a favorite button the user will be prompted with the request to create an account.
* Validate favorites before adding to db. Aka does that user already have the movie stored as favorites.
* If the user visits /favorites they should see a list of all their favorite movies.
* Once on /favorites the user should have the option to delete the movie.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Micro Aggressions)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from each session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

* It's a sensitive world we live in. It's better to talk like your walking on eggshells than to risk offending someone. I can understand that we need to be aware of a individuals sensitivites, but I can't be living in fear of everyones sensitivities. 

#### (Allyship)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from each session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

* Allyship is basicly just reinventing the wheel. We're all part of team, part of a community of individuals. Let's just treat eaachother with respect and strive to understand eachother. Isn't that what we've been taught all out lives? Why give it a new name? 

## E: Community Participation
  * I helped with the high school coding thing that happened one thursday morning. 

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
I don't think I did. I can barely keep up with Turing's pace, let alone lead. A guy running at the end of the pack isn't able to provide motivation to those he's following.
