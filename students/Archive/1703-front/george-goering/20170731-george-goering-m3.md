# Individual Assessment: Pass
  
  --------------
  # Projects:
    ## Project: Headcount2.0  
    ## Students: George Goering & Dave Weinstock
    ## Evaluator: Jhun
    ## Notes:

## Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes 5 iterations.

## Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

## PropType Implementation

- Pass + - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

## CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.
indicated in the comp.

## Testing

- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

    ## Instructor: Taylor
    
    ### Specification Adherence  

* 3.5: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### JavaScript Style

* 3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Testing

* 2.5: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each otherâ€™s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.
    
    
    
    # Project: Silly Bets (self-directed)
    ## Student: George Goering
    ## Instructor: Taylor

    ### Project Scope

Notes:
Can't auto sign in after sign up. Can't change bets. Normalize inputs. Activity feed needs work.
Sign in / signing up routes.
GetOwnBets refactor
Private routes.
UI/UX
Tests

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 3.5: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

**2. Organization**

* 3.5: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 3: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).

**2. Code Quality**

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.

### Product Experience

**1. User Experience**

* 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

**2. Performance**

* 4: Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.

# Gear Ups
 
 ## Gear up on microaggressions
 
  * Had some nice talks with the mod on how to best approach somebody who might be making some microaggressions.  It's important to do so in a way that does not humiliate and shame the person as that might hurt your cause more than help it.
 
 ## Gear up on allieship
 
  * I definitely liked the idea that being an ally is not a trait one has, but it's something that one demonstrates through action. I also liked the idea that effective allyship is more about standing up for others to your peers (in my case, white people) and not necessarily about reaching out to minority groups to reaffirm that you support them, as that does little to reduce their struggle.  
  
 *  However, I do not agree that allyship should extend to being obligated to make your social events accommodating to everyone regardless of their limitations.  I have to say, the scenario where the cohort decides to go to the bar really bothered me because I don't think it's a good example of "when someone could have used an ally", and in my opinion cheapens the use of the term when it is applied to areas such as racial or gender inequality. 
 
 
 We as members of society have an obligation to treat others with respect, courtesy, equality (in terms of opportunity) and not to directly harm others.  Our rights allow us to spend our time as we wish, to be safe, to own possesions, to express our beliefs to others... what they don't allow us to do is to attempt to dictate how others should spend their time. 
 
 
 In the scenario where the cohort decides to go to the bar, someone feels left out because they don't want to, or feel like they can't be around alcohol.  I do not believe it is a reasonable expectation for that person to think that they should be accommodated and have the whole group do something else just for their sake.  The non-drinker who took issue with this is not respecting the rights of others to spend their time as they wish, and it's nobody's obligation to make sure that the group does something this person feels comfortable taking part in, and it's also nobody's obligation to assume that just because this person doesn't drink, they are uncomfortable even being around alcohol. As there was no violation of the non drinker's rights, and nobody in the group broke a societal obligation, I disagree at the application of allyship in this situation.

## Gear up on when to learn a new language

 * One thing that may seem obvious but was not obvious to me was that the best time to learn a new language is when you have to.  It can be very difficult to motivate yourself to learning one on your own, but if you put yourself in a position where you are forced to learn it, you will have a good chance of succeeding.
