# George Goering - M4 Portfolio 
 
 ## Areas of Emphasis:
 
Going into the mod I honestly thought I'd have time to keep working on my personal project.  Mod 4 was a lot of work though so  that didn't happen.  I mostly wanted something to present at demo night, which I now have through the capstone which I am super excited about.

 ## Feedback
 
 Bottom line, I thought our partnership was very successful.  We accomplished the goals we had set out to in our DTR, and in my opinion, worked very well together in accomplishing those goals.  As a teammate, I appreciated that you were willing to work together through most things while also divvying up tasks where appropriate, and that you were on board with using and sticking to Waffle.  I also appreciated your willingness to answer my questions around some of the bugs we encountered where fixing them seemed to come quickly to you.  The struggle is so real coming up with areas for improvement, so I’ll instead provide encouragement for your next projects in my favorite area of organization: keep it up with the linters and the waffle boards!  It’s clear you’re comfortable with or without them, so I’d encourage you to use them by default for the rare or not-so-rare occasion where they’ll save your butt.  Thanks for a great project.  I learned a lot and would be thrilled to work with you again.

 ## Gear up
 
 The repo for our group can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1708-inning/group_three.md)
 
 I'm not really the type of guy who wants to be at the front of the class lecturing on this or that, so I thought this gear up went really well because we had a very long small group discussion portion, where people were able to share their thoughts and feelings about our topic.  It felt like a good discussion, not necessarily because we worked towards some tangible endpoint, but because we created a space to encourage one another on our journey through a risky and potentially difficult time in life.
  
 
 ## Additional Notes
 
 Mod 4 had excellent lessons/lectures.  It was WAY more work than I had anticipated, and I'm fine with that.  The downside is that I won't get to start the job search until I am back in the USA.  Turing was pretty fun.  I believe I achieved all my learning goals.  I still look at stuff like React-Router or Redux and have no clue how I would build something like that, but hopefully someday I'll understand it.  
 
 
 I want to make money again but I am still a little sad it's over.  Bittersweet for sure.  Thanks to the instructors for the passion and effort they put into the curriculum!
