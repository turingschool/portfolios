# George Goering - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Loved data structures and algorithms! Was easily my favorite set of projects so far.  I am glad I got more comfortable with React as we made our way through Weathrly.  I worked on having cleaner, more modular code this time around and believe I made some solid progress but still with more room to improve.

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints


#### (Complete-Me)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ggoering/gg-complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html) .

Scores: All 3's and 2 4's.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

There were 3 major group projects this mod.  All projects were completed with all functionality through phase 3.

## (Game Time)

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Empathy

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

Empathy is crucial to having positive human relationships.  On a large scale it is important for all people to have empathy for one another in order to have a peaceful, happier society.  A lack of empathy is the same as a lack of perspective for others experiences.  This could lead to xenophobia, gender discrimination, etc.  It also helps building friendship :)

#### Universal Basic Income

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

I am very much for UBI.  I think the big hangup is people are afraid it will be implemented poorly, which is extremely fair.  I think there is a huge blindspot to what will happen to society if even 25% of people are unemployed and how devastating that would be for both social order and the economy.  UBI could give the people who otherwise wouldn't be capable of being employed in a high aptitude / high education only society a chance at a decent life.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was probably one of the most prolific pairers of my mod.  I paired at least 3 days a week all mod until the last week of instruction.

####Feedback: 
#####Ralph: 
I wanted to thank you for taking the time (very often) to pair up and help me out throughout this mod with projects, mythical creatures and the various other things.  Of all the pairings I have done from both this and last mod, You have to be one of the best people to work with.  Going back to last mod, whenever I asked you a question or needed help on figuring out some logic you were able to break it down for me in a way I could best understand and apply.  You prompted me to think about a solution as opposed to just handing over the answer, this was incredibly helpful for me to learn.  You have always been very supportive and encouraging and I really appreciate that.  I hope to be able to pair with you in the future.  Thanks again George,  you are wicked awesome!

#####Christie: Thank you for being such an awesome pair partner to me all mod!! I appreciate you making yourself available whenever I had questions and being so encouraging. You always know just how to lead me down the right path while still challenging me to work through difficult concepts. You were a HUGE part of my success this mod, and for that I THANK YOU!!
