# George Goering - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to learn the javascript principles that are taught this mod extremely thoroughly so that I had a rock-solid foundation going into mod 2.  I also wanted to establish a very challenging level of commitment in terms of working effort and hours, because I believe that work ethic is something that I have lacked.  Lastly, to continue to build my growth mindset, I tend to instinctively shy away from learning difficult skills, and I wanted continue to develop myself past that shortcoming.

## A: End of Module Assessment

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 1
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

Did a good job, made some long functions and a few things he wanted to clean up (and explained how he would do that if he had more time). Got ahead of himself a couple of times, but would slow down when reminded to and take smaller steps really well. Got into phase 2, had button disabled and enabled based on whether or not it had a value.

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Proficient:__ Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

#### Conditional Logic

* __Proficient:__ Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Proficient:__ Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Proficient:__ Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the "why" of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Proficient:__ Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DEBUGGING

#### Dev Tools/Debug Process

* __Proficient__: Uses the dev tools as their first line of defense when encountering something unexpected. Demonstrates comfort and skill using dev tools to investigate, check layout issues, console log results, and expweriment solving problems before writing abundant amounts of code. Will experiment with javascript in the console to test unfamiliar concepts.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

#### Design Concepts

* __Proficient__: Can apply fundamental design concepts in a comp that demonstrates a thoughtful, purposeful, cohesive strategy that does not detract from legibility or overall design integrity.

##### FeedBack FROM CIARA

It was fun working with you. Your willingness to try new things really came out, and as a result, the project had some great functionality that you implemented! I also appreciated that you consistently checked in with me, and I felt that our communication was excellent. It was awesome to see you go home and work hard on functionality that you wanted to figure out. In terms of coaching, I would say to keep working on functions where we still need implementation for completing the project and then circle back to refactor functions/try new things once we are done. Your commitment to the success of our project made it a breeze working with you. Thanks for being a great partner!

#### (Project Name)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ggoering/todo-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This Project was a refactor assignment with some goals for the code.  We used nested return statements to eliminate the global variables, which felt really slick.  All a filter function was also created which could filter on multiple values.  Otherwise it's just like idea-box.

##### FEEDBACK FROM JAMES
I cannot stress enough how good this pairing was for me.   I feel our styles meshed organically and the DTR expectations we set at the beginning of the project were easily met due to this.  Your fluency in JavaScript is both impressive and ahead of the curve.  Your work ethic and dedication are nothing short of inspiring.  Aside from all that, I feel working with you brought out the best in me.  Our cohort is pretty quick to help one another.  But this mentality is truly tested at the end of a twelve hour day.  You staying with me and encouraging me to finish that last piece of functionality I was  struggling with late Tuesday night was, in my opinion, the embodiment of the Turing community spirit.  I really felt like you took an interest in my learning and that nudge was something I really needed to level up in my education.  I find it exceedingly hard to give any coaching feedback because I think you're doing such a good job.  That being said, a five minute break during those more difficult moments might be helpful.  You're a code beast and I admire your dedication.  I know you'll solve any problem either way.  Experimenting with breaks could may throw on some light bulbs quicker than you think though.  Regardless, I really gained something working with you and keep doing an amazing job on the programming AND people side of things.  Thanks bud!


## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

The first thing I wrote in my book was "Never give up". That's been my mantra during every single project, and I think I've adhered to it very well.  This is only the beginning though.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

I think I consider myself "good enough" too easily, and that prevents me from reaching that mastery level.  I also think I shy away from learning difficult things which I need to revert.  It can be very easy to use a less efficient solution if it's one that I am comfortable with.

#### Working with introverts, extroverts, ambiverts

I am an ambivert and that's cool.  Some people are extroverts or introverts and that's cool too.  That means that have different personalities and if you want to have the best interactions with them then I should be sensitive to that and act accordingly.

#### Feedback

Feedback can be hard to receive.  People don't always take the feedback the way it was intended, or they don't take it because they don't believe it for whatever reason.  I think keeping in mind that it is often necessary to refer to a specific situation if you are going to give feedback that is in anyway negative or coaching is helpful, otherwise the feedback could be rejected and the relationship damaged.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap
I was really affected by the story of the lady at Github.  
1. My biggest takeaway is that I think the men lashed out because they felt like their culture (which was in fact celebrating misogyny) was being taken away from them.  They enjoyed sharing 'guy things' amongst each other, and when a woman came in they felt like she was taking away their fun, even though it doesn't take much to realize how alienating and unprofessional their behavior was.  The roots of this stuff goes back way further than the tech industry, and has a lot to do with raising children with toxic ideas of certain gender roles and appropriate behavior.  
2. My other big takeaway is more of a question - can this even really be stopped?  If the roots of this behavior are a mix of culture and human nature, does being the guy in the office to stand up and tell the others that their behavior is inappropriate do anything at all? Or is it like an atheist trying to convince a Catholic that God doesn't exist, or a liberal trying to convince his conservative neighbor that the Republicans are actually more fiscally irresponsible than the Democrats?


### Professional Development Workshops

*   [Link to my Census](https://login.turing.io/users/212)

I recognize the value of looking professional on social media.  Social media is a great way to network, and could lead to jobs.  It influences other people's impressions of you.  It also makes me sad that I need to use it because it feels like less of a meritocracy in the hunt for a job, and I generally think social media interactions are extremely impersonal and its use often has very vane overtones.  


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Helped people in my mod with coding challenges and debugging.  Stayed late every single project night and helped whenever asked.
