# Jason Collins - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module?

_This module I set out to learn more about backend development and API construction. Given that I have several product ideas of my own, I really want to be able to leverage Node/Express to build full stack applications._

## A: End of Module Assessment

### Garage Bin project (Date: September 14 2017, Evaluator: Robbie, Grade: Pass)
This was a 10 hour assignment to build a project spec from the ground up using a Node/Express backend and jQuery or React front-end.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Below are the list of individual projects that I worked on through Module 4. What was great about these was working mainly on backend code and learning more about Node/Express.

#### Personal Project - JetFuel

_description_

This was a project to build a URL shortening service, similar to Bitly. The user should be able to create folders and within those folders, create shortened links.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

During Module 4, I worked on three group projects. The first, BYOB, I paired with Jimmy Sullivan. The second, House of Vars, was a three person project and I paired with Jimmy Sullivan and Evan Miller. The third, Capstone, was a four person project and I paired with Cole Worsley, Justyna Field, and Daniel Bucket.

#### BYOB (Build Your Own Backend)

* [Evaluation Results](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1703/mod-4/byob/jc-jamessullivan.md)

_description_

BYOB was a backend that we built to support loading image EXIF data, with the ability to also associate the photos with a specific location and instructions on how to access the location. The intent was for BYOB to be used for location sharing for photographers.

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)

_description_

Happy Hour Power is an app to allow the crowdsourcing of happy hour information for local bars and restaurants. Currently, the happy hour menus are not published because they change frequently, so this app allows users to search for local happy hour deals at various bars/restaurants.

## D: Professional Skills
Throughout this module, the professional skills focus was on interview preparation, specifically on the technical side of things. All of the classroom practice and prep was useful for everyone. the job search strategies were also useful, not only for immediately following Turing, but for life.

### Gear Up

#### The Psychology of UX/UI

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1708-inning/group_two.md)

This was a gear up that we taught for a Mod 4 assignment. The basis of the gear-up was to help educate participants about the differences between User Experience (UX) and User Interface Design (UI), and explain how they are both governed by the principles of Design Theory. This was a fun gear-up to teach as a group, although I feel like it might be too much, given all the other deliverables we have in Mod 4.

### Playing a Part

During Module 4, I participated in the Turing community by attending Demo Nights, stepping up as the voted leader of the posse I am a part of (_de-icaza-posse_), and pairing with/mentoring several Mod 2 and 3 students throughout the inning. I also participated in Iron FE and helped teach a few of the sessions.
