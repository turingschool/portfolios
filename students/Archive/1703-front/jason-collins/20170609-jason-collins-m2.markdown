# Jason Collins - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module?

_This module, I knew that we would be focusing on some of the more algorithm heavy concepts, with more of a focus on JavaScript. I also knew we would be getting our first exposure to React. Given my background and the things I've seen built in React, I was very excited to finally get some hands-on exposure to the library. The final couple weeks of the module were a great learning experience for me as we struggled (as a cohort) through understanding the magic of React and learning a bit about how it does what it does. I also think the GameTime project really opened my eyes to the power of Canvas, which was definitely a goal for this module._

## A: End of Module Assessment

### Live Coding Assessment (Date: June 6 2017, Evaluator: Mike Limberg, Grade: Pass)
This was a 35 minute assessment of the core principles of what we were taught during Module 2, including ES6 concepts (var/let/const), Array.prototype methods, bind and this, etc.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Below are the list of individual projects that I worked on through Module 2. These were a rally great learning experience for me, however I think I much prefer the development process when working alongside someone else. Collaboration is legit, yo!

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/the-oem/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)
* [Evaluation Results](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1703/mod-2/sorting-suite/jc.md)

Sorting Suite was a project where we focused on learning different sorting algorithms and how they work. the outcome of the project was our own implementation of Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.

Comments during the evaluation were to use ES6 all in, rather than mix ES5 and ES6 syntax. Also, thinking about testing some helper functions along with the actual sorting code, including some negative testing such as empty and single element arrays.

* [Evaluation Results](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1703/mod-2/complete-me/jc.md)

Complete Me was a project where we got our first look at sorting algorithms, starting with a binary tree sort and ending with a prefix sort, which we implemented as part of the project. the end result was packaging it up as an NPM module to be used in later projects.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

During Module 2, I worked on two group projects. The first, Game Time, I paired with Evan Miller. The second, Weathrly, I paired with Lindsay Parker. Both projects utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Game Time also utilized HTML Canvas, and Weathrly utilized React.

#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/the-oem/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)
* [Evaluation Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1703/mod-2/game-time/jc-evan.md)

This project was so fun! I honestly didn't think we'd be able to build a game in such a short amount of time, so I was very impressed when the entire cohort seemed to be making great progress by the end of the first week. I've never used HTML Canvas, and seeing what it is capable of was impressive and definitely piqued my curiosity about finding out how to do more with it, as an artistic outlet.

(Feedback with Evan, done as a verbal conversation during a Feedback Gear Up) - Evan and I worked really well together, and it was something we both pointed out. We created a solid DTR as part of the project kickoff and we had verbal checkins on a regular basis to make sure we both felt we were holding up our commitments outlined in the DTR. The feedback that I gave Evan was specific to his preference to fly solo over pair program. Because of this we took more of a dive and conquer approach rather than working today doing driver/navigator or ping-pong pairing.

#### Weathrly

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)
* [Evaluation Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1703/mod-2/weathrly/lindsay-jc.md)

This project was such a great learning experience because of how much I was looking forward to React. The lessons and knowledge shared about React from all 3 instructors was a great jumpstart into React development. This was also the first project where we were integrating data from an API, so that was super rad, too! I think the biggest challenges were understanding when and how to use STATELESS vs STATEFUL components, and how to best test each of them.

(Feedback with Lindsay, done as verbal communication during checkins with each other) - Lindsay is a very organized person, which I so appreciated during this project. She was always keeping us on task and making sure we had a checklist at the end of the day of what the most important things were to tackle next. Our communication was on-point, and I felt like our work ethics matched up very well, which led to an easy pairing experience where we both pulled our weight equally. If we work together in the future, we both agreed that we need to speak up if something is important to us. As an example, our implementation of error handling was totally acceptable to her, but not to me, so I spent additional time cleaning up the implementation. This didn't cause any problems, but it was a great point to have a conversation about in our final pair feedback session.

## D: Professional Skills
One of the things I appreciate most about Turing is the focus on professional skills and development. Having been in the industry for years already, and being very aware of the importance of these things, I am continually impressed with how Turing incorporates them into the curriculum.

### Gear Up

#### Empathy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

The Empathy gear-up was focused primarily on understanding empathy and the role it plays in our success, as developers, but also as humans. This is especially true at Turing, where everyone comes from a vastly different background. We don't know the struggles that someone has endured to get here, and it is a lesson in empathy to work to learn their story. This type of thinking is what we need to embrace in the workplace if we are ever to tear down some of the walls that still exist around various things like gender bias, etc.

#### Parable of the Polygon/Automation (Tragedy of the Commons)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

This gear up focused on diversity and segregation in a community, and how those things can be changed by just shifting your perspective even slightly. Many people look at topics like diversity and think "How can I even impact that large problem?" and this gear up was great in that it illustrated ways for everyone to consciously make a difference on this very prevalent and sometimes difficult topic.

#### Case Study (Knowledge, What is it? taught by Mod 4)

This session got serious deep, on a metaphysical level! It started with structure but ended up being a very free-flowing group conversation about knowledge, how we each define it, and how it applies to something like programming. It was an exercise in abstract thinking...which in many ways directly applies to solving programming problems.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During Module 2, I participated in the Turing community by attending Demo Nights, representing our cohort on the Student Advisory Board, participating in the Code Fair (showing off our Game Time project), and pairing with numerous Mod 1 students throughout the inning. Additionally, I joined the Pahlka posse to help build an app called Food4All.

#### Pairing Feedback from Jason Lucas

> "JC,

> Thanks for taking the time to pair with me this last Mod.  You are one of the better communicators I have ever worked with.  You are very good at relating an alternate scenario in comparison to a problem that I am having trouble with to help me understand the logic.  Having the patients to make sure that I understand every step in solving a problem has made a huge difference for me in this Mod.  Bringing a white board to our pairings and pseudo coding thru a problem first has become an valuable habit that I use now everyday.  I also appreciate that our pairings are casual and fun.  I look forward to pairing with you next Mod.  Thank you.""

#### Pairing Feedback from Ralph Burnette

> Hey there JC,  I wanted to thank you for helping me  out during pairings this last mod.  I appreciate the time you take to offer your a fresh view of difficult subjects that don't make sense at first.  You have an uncanny ability to break down the problem and give it a real life application (in my case cars) so that I can better understand it and work through it.  Thank you for your patience and on going support, you are awesome!

#### Pairing Feedback from Christie Lynam

> Thank you for being such an awesome pair partner to me all mod!! I appreciate you making yourself available whenever I had questions and being so encouraging. You always know just how to lead me down the right path while still challenging me to work through difficult concepts. You were a HUGE part of my success this mod, and for that I THANK YOU!!
