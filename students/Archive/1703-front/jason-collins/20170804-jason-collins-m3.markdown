# Jason Collins - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module?

_This module I set out to cement my knowledge of React, and add to it knowledge of Redux and Router. Part of what I really want to come away with at Turing is a good foundation to begin iOS development using React Native, so the React learning is very important to me. I also wanted to get experience working with back-end API's as data sources for client development._

## A: End of Module Assessment

### Live Coding Assessment (Date: July 27 2017, Evaluator: Taylor Moore, Grade: Pass)
This was a 45 minute assessment of the core principles of React, Redux, fetch, and async JavaScript.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Below are the list of individual projects that I worked on through Module 3. These were a really great learning experience for me, even in the cases where it was individual work. I loved learning more about React and adding Redux/Router to the mix.

#### Personal Project - The Bearded Bartender

* [Evaluation Results](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1703/mod-3/personal-project/jason-collins/rubric.md)

_description_

This was a project where we had a lot of creative latitude in designing the features and the UI/UX. We were expected to leverage the things we'd learned throughout Mod 3 to build an application in 2 weeks. I chose to build a React/Redux/Router application on the front-end, with a Node/ExpressJS backend. The project also took advantage of the Absolut Drink DataBase API.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

During Module 3, I worked on three group projects. The first, Headcount 2.0, I paired with Juan Jimenez. The second, SWAPI-Box, I paired with Breana Knight. The third, Movie Tracker, was a three person project and I paired with Lindsay Parker and George Goering.

#### Headcount 2.0

* [DTR](https://github.com/the-oem/headcount2.0/blob/master/dtr.md)

_description_

Headcount 2.0 was a project that used static data files to allow users to explore and compare various school information data sets. This project kick-started us again into React and got us thinking in the React way again after a two week long break from school.

_description_

SWAPI-Box was a project where we first tackled asynchronous JavaScript through multiple nested fetch calls to third party API's. This was a great learning experience, however my partner was rarely involved, which was slightly frustrating.

_description_

Movie Tracker was a fun group project, and the first project where 3 people were involved. The project was a collection of everything we'd learned to date in the Mod, which included React, Redux, Router, and async JavaScript.

## D: Professional Skills
One of the things I appreciate most about Turing is the focus on professional skills and development. Having been in the industry for years already, and being very aware of the importance of these things, I am continually impressed with how Turing incorporates them into the curriculum.

### Gear Up

#### Microagressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

This was a good gear up to talk about issues we've experienced while at Turing. While I haven't experienced anything serious, I do keep feeling like people don't expect me to be here, given my past working experience. I often get asked questions about why I am in Turing in a way that makes me sometimes feel not welcomed.

#### Allyship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)

This was an interesting Gear-Up because it was based on experiences of students at Turing. It shows that even inside the safe bubble that is Turing, bias and discrimination can still occur in ways that move us backwards instead of forwards.

**Scenario 1:** A group of Turing students are planning to walk in the Pride parade this summer and has opened the invitation to all students. While working on your project, one of your team member says that they wish all the talk about gay pride would be over and that it is a distraction to what we are all trying to do here at Turing.

_You could be an ally in this situation by expressing your concern over that individuals lack of respect for people who may be “different” than they are, and see if they would be open to a conversation exploring why they expressed that feeling. If I were a member of the targeted group, I would want an ally to speak up and help to educate about the importance of diversity in a field where there isn’t much, such as technology. If the situation were ignored, the student who made the comment may assume that everyone agreed because there was no objection to the comment, and it may lead to a boldness to continue speaking out about the topic._

**Scenario 2**: You know there are several people in your cohort who don't drink, but come Thursday, most of your friends want to go to a bar down the street. It's someone's birthday today, so your cohort's "social coordinator" invites everyone out, but you know there are several people who won't be comfortable being at a bar.

_You could be an ally by offering up a suggestion for a way to celebrate that may be more inclusive of everyone, including people who don’t drink. If I were one of the targeted group, I would very much want an ally to speak up and show support for doing something that didn’t require drinking as a group in order to celebrate a birthday. If it is ignored, people will not learn to think inclusively when planning any sort of group activities for the cohort._

**Scenario 3:** One of your friends is talking about one of the Joan Clarke events for women students that they attended. A student in your cohort, who does not identify as a woman, says that it is unfair that such exclusive groups exist. They would like to be able to take part in those group's events as well.

_As an ally, I would explain the importance of the small, supportive groups and encourage the person to organize something of their own if they wished to explore the topic being discussed by the women students. If I were one of the targeted, I would hope that an ally would speak up about the importance of shared experience, and how that brings people together very closely, which is why the small groups are important. If the topic is ignored, that person will continue to speak out against small groups without possibly knowing the damage they are causing to relationships and perceptions._

#### Case Study (Learning a New Language, taught by Mod 4)

This was a good opportunity to get ideas about how to learn a new language, given that we'll all be having to do it after Turing, most likely. One thing I suggested was to read the book Seven Languages in Seven Weeks, as well as its follow-up book. It's a great primer for diving into a new language and understanding the basic tenets of the language quickly, which is a helpful skill to have as a developer.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During Module 3, I participated in the Turing community by attending Demo Nights, stepping up as the voted leader of the posse I am a part of (_de-icaza-posse_), teaching the students in my cohort some of the basics of postgreSQL, and pairing with numerous Mod 2 students throughout the inning.

#### Project Partner Feedback

* During Headcount 2.0, Juan and I met daily to sync up on the project and evaluate where we were with regards to the project deliverables. Working with Juan was very easy, and he is a great teacher and a solid project partner.

* For SWAPI-Box, I never really got a chance to get feedback from Breana. She was largely absent during the project because of other commitments, and then she left the program immediately following the delivery of the project.

* During Movie Time, Lindsay, George and I met in the middle of the project to check in and see how everyone was doing with the additional dynamic of a third person. There was one point in which George and I were implementing Routing and Lindsay wasn't at school so wasn't involved, but she reached out and we pulled her into it. Lesson learned on that one was to be better about communicating and make sure that other are given an opportunity to work on things they have an interest in.

- Leading an IronFe
- Students would benefit from your knowledge
