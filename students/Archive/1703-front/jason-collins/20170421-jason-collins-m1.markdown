# Jason Collins - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module?

_I set out to accomplish getting my developer legs underneath me, again. Having been a developer years and years ago, I knew that I would need to get back into that mindset, where the work that gets done is while sitting at a computer rather than sitting in a meeting. I also really wanted to re-ignite that fire to create things again. It's something I have felt was very much missing from my professional life over the past 10 years or so. I think that goal was a big success, as I find myself thinking about all the things I want to build now with this new knowledge I have._

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Below are the list of individual projects that I worked on through Module 1. These were a rally great learning experience for me, however I think I much prefer the development process when working alongside someone else. Collaboration is legit, yo!

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/the-oem/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was an app that allowed users to set a range for random numbers and make attempts to guess the correct random number. If the user guessed correctly, the game got more difficult and the range would increase by 20 and a new number would be generated.

In my evaluation, it was pointed out that I need to be more consistent with class naming for CSS. I also need to not mix my JS in my markup. I should also be more diligent about only using global vars when they are needed.

[Evaluation Results](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1703/mod-1/number-guesser/jason_collins.md)

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/the-oem/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Idea Box was an application that allowed users to enter ideas (with a title and body), and they would be added to a list of ideas on the page. Users could vote the idea feasability up or down, delete the ideas, and search the ideas by title/body/quality.

For this project, I was solo. The feedback was that my code was clean and well refactored. Also, I need to take more advantage of Array prototypes.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

During Module 1, I worked on two group projects. The first, Foto Finder, I paired with Tyler Garner. The second, 2DoBox Pivot, I paired with Kristi Green. Both projects utilized HTML, CSS, and JS (jQuery).

#### Foto Finder

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/the-oem/foto-finder)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/foto-finder.html)

Foto Finder was an app that allowed users to choose an image from their local computer and add it to a list of photos on the page. Users are able to delete the image cards, or favorite them.

For this project, I paired with Tyler. In my evaluation, it was pointed out that I need to structure my HTML with responsiveness and breakpoints in mind. I should also be setting up my JS files differently, with loader functions. I asked Bree for some examples of this that I could take a look at, so that I can incorporate that thinking into my development process.

[Evaluation Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1703/mod-1/foto-finder/tyler_jason.md)

* (Feedback from Tyler) - JC was a very accommodating and helpful partner to have in the project. Initially, I was fearful that the gap in our skill level would lead to frustration from either one or both of us, but it wasn’t that way at all.  Even though I’m sure JC could have whipped up that entire project in a day, he was incredibly respectful of how we divvied up the workload in our DTR, and did nothing but offer help along the way. We divided up the work based on what we thought each of us could accomplish, since that was really the only way for us to complete it in the few days time we had. It was clear that JC was more concerned with me learning than actually completing the project (although that was still important to both of us). Since then, he’s regularly been checking in with me to see how I’m doing, and offering help.  If I had to do offer some coaching for JC, it’d be that when it came time to show our project to Bree, I think he was so excited to show what he’d done that he did the majority of the speaking. It felt like it was his project in that space more than ours.  I think JC has met his DTR goal of working well with a partner with flying colors, I’d love to be paired with him again someday.Thanks, JC!

#### 2DoBox Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/the-oem/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

2DoBox Pivot was a refactoring project. The intent was to take someone else's code from Idea Box and refactor it, then pivot the application and turn it into 2DoBox. The idea behind 2DoBox was to allow users to add to-do items to a list. Users could search, filter, delete, inline edit, and adjust the priority.

For this project, I paired with Kristi. In our evaluation, we were told that the refactored code was really clean. Most of the feedback was on the HTML/CSS side of things, where some aesthetics needed to be cleaned up.

[Evaluation Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1703/mod-1/todobox-pivot/kristi-jc.md)

* (Feedback from Kristi) - It was really nice working with Jason.  His knowledge of javascript is vast and he really grasps not only the concepts but what is actually happening as the code is being compiled.  His ability to quickly troubleshoot problems and create a solution was really neat to see.  He was very communicative and open, which made pairing easy. He is a great leader and willing to teach and he's patient and respectful about it. He could improve in having a little more patience with allowing me to talk through out loud what the code is doing, so as letting me finish my thought process before interjecting with a summation of what the code is doing.

## D: Professional Skills
One of the things I appreciate most about Turing is the focus on professional skills and development. Having been in the industry for years already, and being very aware of the importance of these things, I really was impressed with how Turing incorporates them into the cirriculum.

### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

This was an especially important gear up session for me, given I haven't been in full time learning mode for many years. I've been in tech for so long that it is easy to take for granted what I used to know. But here at Turing, I was challenged from day 1 and approaching it all with a growth mindset was really critical to success this mod.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

This was interesting because I've been exploring various learning styles, and incorporating this thinking into my learning process will be very valuable as I progress through the modules. It's fun to think about how good at this I'll be if I focus and dial in my learning process.

#### Working with Extro/Intro/Ambiverts

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)
* [Article URL](https://www.fastcompany.com/3016031/leadership-now/are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert-and-what-it-means-for-your-career)

This was a fun exercise because I'm very extroverted, and most of the rest of the mod 1 student body identifies as more ambivert/introvert. the piece that was valuable to me was being able to think critically about how I am percieved by others, and how that can either help or hinder my progress in a program like Turing.

#### Personal Story

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

This was an important lesson because personal brand is such a valuable thing, especially when you are trying to differentiate yourself from the thousands of other developers looking for jobs. I've had a lot of experience interviewing and hiring developers, and the people who have invested in their personal brand are the developers who stand out to me.

#### CODE Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

I can't say enough about the importance of this topic. I think my biggest takeaway was understanding that in order to solve this problem, it requires far more than just advocating for females in tech. It actually starts with parents breaking down the walls early on in life with their children, and not falling into the habit of unknowingly reinforcing gender bias.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During Module 1, I participated in the Turing community be attending Demo Nights, being on the Q&A panel for Try Turing, and representing our cohort on the Student Advisory Board. I also spent time organizing and teaching Friday Spikes to help our cohort understand better the lessons from the week. These spikes were specifically geared towards Array prototype methods, Mythical Creature understanding, and looking at code from the Idea Box project.

Additionally, I joined the Turing Lab posse to help build a mini arcade MAME machine.
