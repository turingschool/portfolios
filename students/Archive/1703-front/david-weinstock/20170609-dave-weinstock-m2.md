### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dstock48/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

#### Description
Build a prefix-trie to be used in an auto-complete application

#### Evaluation Comments
- Front end is sick!
- Count not accounting for duplicates, try to get working correctly
- Look to be more consistent with style (i.e. "function" vs. arrow, spacing, semi colons, etc.)
- polish it before evals
- remove comments explaining what code does, if you still need, move to separate branch. Master should be clean.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Empathy (ft Emily Freeman)

My primary takeaway from this gear up was that respecting others and having empathy for those that might be different from you is vastly important, especially in the tech industry workplace. 

#### Parable of the Polygon

In this gear up we learned about the power that a small personal bias can have and how it can spread and effect entire populations. It is important to force ourselves out of our comfort zone and expose ourselves to those who are different from us so that we have a broader world view and a more diverse community.

#### Universal Basic Income (ft Mod 4)

We are quickly approaching a future where many jobs will be replaced by AI and robotics, and we will need to find a solution for those displaced by these technological advancements. One of the proposed solutions is the idea of a Universal (or unconditional) Basic Income. This is a hotly debated topic right now and there are a few small experiments being done by a few countries around the world to see how this could be implemented and how it would work. I think UBI is a great idea and has the potential to solve many more societal issues than just unemployment.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During this mod, I have had multiple pairings with students in the 1705 FE cohort. 

Here is feedback from one of the students I paired with:

"Hi there Dave,  Thanks for taking the time and pairing with me (and helping me solve problems randomly throughout the day) .  It was super beneficial for me to get your take and view on things especially when it came to the logic in JS.  You were able to help me break down the problem and arrive at a solution.  You are very good at what you do, keep up the good work and thank you again!"
