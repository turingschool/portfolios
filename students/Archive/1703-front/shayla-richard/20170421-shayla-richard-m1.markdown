## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to learn. I arrived at Turing completely green and without full knowledge of all of the concepts we'd cover. I have enjoyed the learning experience although overwhelming at times. It became apparent very quickly that I was falling behind and my foundations would need to be built with more time. I've really enjoyed pairing and the aid I've received. I will continue to build my JS foundations and kill it!

## A: End of Module Assessment
I did not pass the end of the module assessment. I have known I'd be repeating Mod 1 for a few weeks now which has allowed me to focus and remediate on JS foundations and exercises. I am not embarrassed or discouraged by this, I feel eager to repeat and utilize what I've learned going forward. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects
My experience on my first paired project with FotoFinder was not successful. Because of this experience I was not paired additionally to work on Idea Box, or 2DoBox Pivot. I also did not complete the NumberGuesser game. I do feel being retained from projects was somewhat alienating. In hindsight I would have liked to pair or work with a similar skilled person and perhaps taken the opportunity to work on something else or perhaps fight through some basics through pairing and discovery. I felt the end of the module assessments were very much like exercises completed in projects like to Idea Box and 2DoBox Pivot. I spent weeks 3-5 feeling defeated. I was able to come back around through utilizing the growth mindset and encouragement of others that I can do this! I will learn JS!

Feedback:
* Pay attention to accessibility: semantic tags and aria attributes
* Work out all the layout first, then worry about polish
* Need to finish solving the responsive issues
* Need to take another pass through the markup and fix nesting issues + random opening element tags with no closures + remove inline styling
* Choose a pattern for organizing css properties and apply throughout (recommend idiomatic approach)
* Look to refactor the odd width percentages that are tiny, like 5% and 7%. I suspect you should be looking at padding on a parent container + px width on the child to achieve the result you are looking for. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

None-FotoFinder was a complete failure. I was steamrolled by my pairing partner and was not able to work collaboratively. Thus I did not collaborate any further in the module.

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown
Growth mindset was such an introduction to the grit component that we are required to have as students at Turing. I enjoyed hearing Dr. Dweck discuss how to keep ourselves from creating a false sense of success. Creating praise for process, effort, and growth in an area. It's shortsighted to praise talent and intelligence. I loved the mantra to focus on the"not yet" component of learning a new area. 
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md
Learning difficult things was the confirmation needed that let me know I was not off kilter with how I learnor why I was feeling completely inept. I did like Kathy Sierra's video and breakdown of how to absorb and learn to master information in a way that was utilizing our cognitive resources. I'd never thought about the brain's capacity to take in or regurgitate information. I thought it was me not being intelligent enough.

Working styles was a really fun exercise in learning how to utilize our strengths to better leverage relationships and working environments. I also was suprised at how my styles had changed as time has passed, also the environment at Turing has also changed the way I interact with others, and how I utilize my skills. I am in a phase of learning and not in an environment I can emerge as anything other than a supporter and participant. 
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown
Storytelling and strengths was fun. I found a commonality with a member of my cohort I admire as a hard worker and smart person. He and I shared a love for Rocky and a champion for the underdog. He and I feel similarly about the two of us being unlikely heroes or potentially the heroes of our own stories. I also found a reconnection to my own story and ideologies about my family, my upbringing, and my identity. 
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown
Debugging the gender code was a great video to watch. There was a quote from the film, "It will be very hard to do something unless you see someone who looks like you doing it."  This rings very true for me. I feel additionally challenged because I am a woman, and I am also Black. I am concerned about how I will be perceived and if I will be well received in my work environments after graduation. However I am additionally inspired to learn this craft well, and teach other people who have an interest in coding, particularly underrepresented groups in tech. 


## E: Community Participation
I went to a few spikes, however as a newbie my time was limited and I did not participate in Pahlka Posse as I'd intended. I did however go to a few talks on Friday mornings.
### Playing a Part

Same as above. I do feel I was supportive and encouraging to my cohort and others who were showing visible signs of distress. I was also on kitchen duty as a part of our MOD 1 responsibilities.
