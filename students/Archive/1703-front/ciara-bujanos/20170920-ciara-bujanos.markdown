## Gear Up

### Community Gear Up: Mod 4 Leads:Failing Gracefully

We got people talking about normalizing failing at a young age, how we learn the most from failing, ways to handle failing in a way that's productive. 
It was interesting doing research and thinking about ways I myself have handled failure. Getting people engaged was fun. 

### F: Feedback

Didn't get any from project partners. Brittany's feedback was to work on confidence when articulating concepts on the whiteboard.
