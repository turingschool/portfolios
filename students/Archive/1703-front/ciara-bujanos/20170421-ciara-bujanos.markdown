# Ciara Bujanos - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

*What did you set out to accomplish this module?*

I set out to build on my fundamental HTML and CSS skills and develop working knowledge of JavaScript. JavaScript was entirely new to me coming into the program so I after getting my feet wet last mod I knew what areas I needed to focus on. I wanted to have a deeper understanding of objects and arrays and also to not be timid to try new things and build my confidence with javascript.

## A: End of Module Assessment

*Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment*

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 1
## Evaluator: Bree
## Optional Notes:

* Work on slowing down. :) Make sure you are looking at things from the user's perspective, as well as considering the code problems, else it is easy to make silly mistakes. 
* Work on trying more things out, rather than asking what you should write.
* Need to improve on debugging and walking through the code line-by-line
* Much improved overall. Keep up the good work.

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Proficient:__ Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

#### Conditional Logic

* __Proficient:__ Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Proficient:__ Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Proficient:__ Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the "why" of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Proficient:__ Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DEBUGGING

#### Dev Tools/Debug Process

* __Proficient__: Uses the dev tools as their first line of defense when encountering something unexpected. Demonstrates comfort and skill using dev tools to investigate, check layout issues, console log results, and experiment solving problems before writing abundant amounts of code. Will experiment with javascript in the console to test unfamiliar concepts.


# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 2

## Evaluator: Robbie

## Optional Notes:

* Big improvement from last mod - definitely is rehearsed, but generally knows what each line of code is doing until you get to more complicated array prototypes
* Needs some more practice with array prototypes, specifically with map and what array prototypes are returning

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Proficient:__ Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

#### Arrays

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
* __Proficient:__ Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Proficient:__ Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the "why" of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## TESTING

#### Test Comprehension

* __Proficient__: Can read through each line of a test and understand how to drive the development to make the test pass. If stuck on making a test pass, they know how to investigate where and how the test is failing using the error messages.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DEBUGGING

#### Dev Tools/Debug Process

* __Proficient__: Uses the dev tools as their first line of defense when encountering something unexpected. Demonstrates comfort and skill using dev tools to investigate, check layout issues, console log results, and experiment solving problems before writing abundant amounts of code. Will experiment with javascript in the console to test unfamiliar concepts.



# Pentathlon: Static Comp Challenge
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

Good attention to detail on the UI implementation. Thoughtful choices around smaller screen sizes and how the layout breaks down. Code is clean and well constructed.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Proficient:__ Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

#### Style

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Proficient__ : Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

#### Implementation

* __Exceptional__ Can articulate rationale for all parts of the CSS implementation (each line of code/CSS rule) specifically in regards to the balance of: structure of code, design integrity, performance.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Exceptional:__ Developer skillfully captures the spirit and design intent of all comp details. Execution is pixel-perfect and any design decisions left open to interpretation are solved intentionally, are as seamless as if the designer had provided the solution, are handled gracefully, and enhance the overall design.

#### Design Concepts

* __Exceptional__: Typography, color choices, and layout decisions are thoughtful and appropriate, and strongly enhance the layout and legibility of the design.

*feedback to me*

"Thank you for being so easy to talk to and empathetic to the struggles that I dealt with this week in grasping some of the concepts. I am very appreciative for your willingness to take the time to go thru each bit of our project to make sure I understood what we were doing. I felt like we communicated very well. Taking the time to walk through the git process together each time we made a commit was very helpful. For coaching feedback, I would just encourage you to speak up more often because you have such great ideas and and are so helpful in teaching difficult concepts.  Working with you was a great experience and I am proud of our finished project."

#### IdeaBox

*description*
In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

*feedback to me*

"Ciara, thanks for being my partner!  I think the project went really well.  You did a great job figuring out the bugs we had with appending the ideas, and I appreciate you teaching me the various shortcuts and reminding me to use them as I kept forgetting.  Your use of github was also excellent and I even though I was hesitant I think it really helped for you to set up the issues board and close the issues with each commit of our project. For the next project, I would push you to try alternative ways to accomplish the various requirements for the project.  It would be a good way to learn something new from doing the same project again."

*feedback to me*

"Pairing with Ciara for the 2DoBox project went really well! I think we were both able to get a lot out of it and improve in the areas that we set out to. I really appreciated how Ciara pushed me to write cleaner and more concise JS rather than the lengthier and hackier code that I'd been writing up until now. We were also able to pay closer attention to using branches on GitHub and being more concious about only making relevant code changes on specific branches. Our schedules worked perfectly together and we were able to work together as a team in person to get through the entire project including the extension, with time to spare to refactor and clean up/organize our code before eval. In terms of areas for improvment, I think there were a couple times where we both might have spent more time than we should have working on a specific feature before asking for help, where it might have been beneficial to ask for help earlier on. Specifically, the functionality of the 'enter' key submitting the form even when the submit button was disabled. Later on when we ran into another big hurdle, we did ask for help earlier on and it ended up being really helpful in keeping the project on track."

## D: Professional Skills
*intro*

### Gear Up
#### (Growth Mindset)

In an environment like Turing it's very easy to compare yourself to others and put yourself in a specific category. Practicing a growth mindset has really helped keep me going in Turing. Remembering to keep a growth mindset can be hard, but I tried to keep taking frustrating situations as a learning experience rather than letting frustrations take over.  

#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

I agree that the fear can impact learning and that if you're in a place where there is a risk you might not succeed it can make you feel flustered and not perform your best. I really liked how they broke down good ways to learn by not trying to learn it all at once, just take a little piece and get good at that, then take another little piece etc... by the end you'll be good at this difficult thing. 

#### (Working Styles)

I really enjoyed this one. It was informative and interesting to hear where certain types of people get their energy from. It was good to hear from people of all spectrums what they need from the people on the opposite side of the spectrum as themselves. It will be handy to keep this in mind just in general life!

#### (Storytelling and Strengths)

I didn't love this exercise. I get the importance of practicing telling your story but having us do it 4 times felt a little excessive. It's good practice though. 

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

I thought this video was valuable for everyone to see. As a woman watching it it was kind of sad to see that this still happens out in the field, but it's good to be aware and I think it was valuable for the men to see as well so that if they see these things happening they can intervene. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

*ways you supported the larger Turing community*

This module I joined the Verou Posse, which proved to be interesting and fun. It was cool to get some exposure to more advanced javascript and meet people from other mods. I also participated in a few of the lunch roulette sessions which was another nice way to meet people in the Turing community.
