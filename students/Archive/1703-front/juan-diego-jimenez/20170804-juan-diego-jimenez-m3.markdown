# Juan Diego Jimenez - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Overall, my main goal was to start learning node.js with express and knex, learn Redux, and outreach a mentor.

#### On the technical side

* I wanted to get a solid understanding of Redux, which I was able to accomplish by practicing it with projects, and from the excellent feedback from the instructors.

* I also wanted to learn how to do backend with node.js and express, which I was able to accomplish by self-studying, and pairing with backend students.

#### On the professional side

* On the professional part, I wanted to finish my resume, which I was able to accomplish, and start prepping for job hunt. I went to 2 meetups of React, which were very helpful, and started practicing coding challenges. I was not able to outreach a mentor, but I will do it on the next mod.

In mod 4 I want to:
* Start a new side project
* Start a blog
* Start cold outreaching
* Outreach more mentors
* Start scheduling coffee meetups
* Learn React Native

I worked on 1 individual projects this mod:

* Personal project: Wellness Game
  * Stack: React, Redux, Postgres, Node, Express, Knex

-----------------------

# Wellness Game

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jdiejim/wellness-game)

### Description

This Web app lets users track their wellness activities each week.

## Features

#### Adding activities

* Users can easily add their daily activities for each of the 4 categories: rest, nutrition, sweat, and personal wellness

#### Dashboard

* The dashboard displays the user's weekly stats, as well as a progress chart, and a spark line chart for each of the four categories.

* It also displays the user's current activities, which can be mark as complete or incomplete by clicking on the checkboxes.

#### Leaderboards

* Users can also see a table which displays other users weekly stats, as wells as their rank each week.

#### Screenshot

#### Future updates

1. Accountability buddy: users can make other users accountable of their activities, and if they are overdue, both users lose points.

2. Rewards: weekly winners are rewarded with the ability to put extra challenges to the whole group.

3. Challenge of the week: this challenge would be weekly and will become available to all users

4. Web sockets: this way we can create a real time database and users can send messages to each other.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I worked on 3 group projects this mod:

* Headcount2.0
* Swapi-Box
* Movie-Tracker

For Headcount2.0 we work with databases and how to import them in a React app. For Swapi-Box we work with React, and learn how to write and test promises. For Movie-Tracker we learn how to talk to a database with fetch calls and learn how to write and test Redux.

## Students: Cole Worsley & Kristi Green & Juan Diego Jimenez & Daniel Ludwick
## Evaluator: Taylor
## Notes:

### Specification Adherence  

* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.


### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


### Testing

* 2.5: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each otherâ€™s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

-----------------------

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

This gear was very eye opening because it is something that happens often. We learned and discussed the importance of not staying quiet, and practiced what to respond if we encounter similar situations.

#### [Allyship](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)

In this gear up we learned the importance of allyship and that to be a good ally takes work. You cannot choose when to be an ally, you have to be consistent. We learned also that by being more vocal about it, we create awareness.

#### Choose your own adventure (Body Language)

This gear up was very useful. It taught us the importance of body language and ways to avoid giving a bad impression. In the session we watched a video without sound and practiced interpreting the speaker body language. We also did some body language exercises like power poses and telling our morning commute using only body language.

-----------------------

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

One of my goals that I set last mod was to be more involved in the Turing community. To accomplish this I did the following:

* Paired with Mod 2 students
* Built a web app that replaces the wellness challenge spreadsheet
* Participated in the productivity lunch group where we discussed strategies/routines/habits to improve our productivity in life, during Turing, and after Turing.

-----------------------

#### Posse

* We shared learnings form the mod
* Share advice of best practices at Turing
* We help each other out if we were struggling with a concept
