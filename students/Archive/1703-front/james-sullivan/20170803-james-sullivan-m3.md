# James Sullivan - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Of course, I wanted to work hard, learn a lot and pass the module.  I wanted to continue expanding my React skills and incorporate Redux and Router into my skillset.  I also wanted to create a cool personal project that did something 'different.'  I feel I accomplished these goals.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3

## A: End of Module Assessment
  
PASS!!!

## B: Individual Work & Projects

My personal project used the Twilio API and Watson API to give sentiment analysis on text messages.  You can text a number I have set up and this info will be texted back to you.  The accompanying website gives more data and information about your texting history.

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

### Project Scope

Notes: Different categories?  Fix texts from last night hovering. Refactoring, pulling fetch'ss out of components
Tests.
README: Add delete comment from Twilio and where the project is left off.

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 3.5: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

**2. Organization**

* 3.5: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 3: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).

**2. Code Quality**

* 3.5: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.

### Product Experience

**1. User Experience**

* 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

**2. Performance**

* 4: Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### (HeadCount 2.0)

* [HeadCount 2.0](https://github.com/jsullivan5/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount was a reintroduction to React.  We worked with population data and had to display it in a meaningful way.

## Students:
## Evaluator:
## Notes:

## Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application completes all 5 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

## Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

## PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.


## CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.


## Testing

- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

#### SWAPI Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jsullivan5/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

SWAPI Box used the Star Wars API to present Star Wars data in a meaningful way.  The project focused on nested async calls.

This project recieved passing marks, but the filled out rubric was unavailable.  The feedback form the instructor was that we could have refactored better in some areas, but we finished all the user stories and testing.

#### Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jsullivan5/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Movie Tracker displayed data from the movieDB API in a meaningful way.  The focus was on Redux and async actions within it.

The grading rubric was unavailable for this project.  Instructor feedback was that testing should have been more throrough.

## D: Professional Skills

Throughout the module, we were required to attend GearUps that bring our attention to topical social issues in the workplace and beyond.

### Gear Up

#### Microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

I learned that microaggressions can be injurious, and often go unchecked.  They are also far more prevelant than I thought.  What I took away was that being an advocate means more than just not doing this.  I have to tactfully address these issues to be an agent of change.

#### Allyship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)

I learned that baing an ally means different things for different people.  I also learned like above, that the only way to truly be an ally is to be vocal when necessary.  I also learened that allyship doesn't mean understanding what it is like to be someone else.  It just means understanding that their experiences are different from my own, and being okay with that.

#### Choose Your Own Adventure - The Attention Economy

I learned about some of the ways tech can manupulate the human psyche to spend more time consuming advertisements on different apps.  I also learned that some people are totally okay with this.  I realized that my role as a developer is to make things that are good enough that people will pay for them so I do not have to monotize my apps through subversive means.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I always try to help my fellow students when I can.  I try to be available for anyone who may need my help, in my class or accross mods.

I was also our posse leader for the mod.  I reached out to our posse mentors and started the dialog our group was wanting to have with them.
