# James Sullivan - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I wanted to fully immerse myself in my education by embracing every learning opportunity offered.  I wanted to build a solid foundation that would serve me for the rest of my tenure and beyond.  I wanted to redescover my focus and drive which I had not been fully in touch with in a while.  I also wanted to begin building my new developer identity.  I knew I wanted to learn to code, but I was fairly intimidated by the task.  Attaining a certain level of comfort with the work and the general life was also an overall goal.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Proficient:__ Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DEBUGGING

#### Dev Tools/Debug Process

* __Proficient:__ Uses the dev tools as their first line of defense when encountering something unexpected. Demonstrates comfort and skill using dev tools to investigate, check layout issues, console log results, and experiment solving problems before writing abundant amounts of code. Will experiment with javascript in the console to test unfamiliar concepts.



# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 2
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

- didnâ€™t start off running the tests, jumped straight into writing code. I had to remind him to let the test guide him several times.
- Needs to work on letting the tests guide him (they can help you figure out weird things, let them!)
- Well done! Good use of array prototype, good troubleshooting and really working to understand the problem.
- GREAT JOB reading error messages and really understanding what's going on and what they're telling you.
- very well done!

# Pentathlon: Static Comp Challenge
## Evaluator: Bree
## Optional Notes:

* Nice job on the less than 700 lines of CSS! bravo!
* Would like to see you improve upon accessibility/aria labeling in your markup

* __Proficient:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Proficient__ : Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS. 

#### Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

#### Design Concepts

* __Exceptional__: Typography, color choices, and layout decisions are thoughtful and appropriate, and strongly enhance the layout and legibility of the design.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

We had a variety of individual and paired projects throughout the mod.  My learning goals in each were to attain proficiency with foundational skill in JavaScript, CSS and HTML.  With my inititial projects, I found balancing the deadlines with deep learning of the material dificult.  This improved as the mod carried on and I feel I now have a much better handle on it.  My skills also improved steadily along the timeline both in assessment scores and in my overall comfort with the material.

This project had us use vanilla javascript to build an application that has the user guess a random number.  The UI was built around matching a comp.

## Evaluator: 
## Optional Notes: 

* Consider the human factor in the min/max range, might be worthwhile to add a confirmation note OR a "set" button. Something in the UI to reinforce that the inputs from user were accepted and the game is in play accordingly.
* Refactor the header and h1 - lose the extra div and the extra h1, can style words independently w/in a single h1 using spans
* Shore up the redundant clearfix class code

## D: Professional Skills


At Turing, emphasis on personal development works alongside that of prefessional growth.  The definition of prefessional growth is not limited to the technical skills.  Rather, Turing also aims to instill the soft skills necessry for prefessional development.

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

I had read Mindset the previous year and didn't realize the full impact of her teachings unitl this session.  The growth mindset is critical for success when learning a new, difficult skill.  I took away that staying positive and being tenacious would be paramount at Turing.  Reframing my thinking during the darker hours would anable me to press on and stay positive.

### Gear Up
#### Get Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

I learned that being mindful of my learning style and how I assimilate information can really take my learning to another level.  I also took away path to learning can take meandering turns and that is okay.  I tend to be the type that tries to find the shortest distance between two points.  A seven month programming course is pretty much that.  But I learned that during those 7 months, my learning process will have ups and downs and I should try to chalk up the doldrums to part of the experience.

### Gear Up
#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

I learned a lot about how people's disposition can affect a team dynamic and how I can better mangage it.  I found it interesting to hear from classmates with different dispositions from my own.  What people need for support tends to differ along the introversion/extroversion spectrum and I need to adapt my style to accomodate.

### Gear Up
#### Feedback

Feedback can be hard to receive.  For me it is harder to give.  I need to remember that feedback is an important catalyst for growth.  Chiefly, good feedback is a catalyst for growth.  I do not mean positive feedback, but thoughtful and actionable feedback.  I learned some techniques to give this kind of feedback that I will be employing at Turing and beyond.

### Gear Up
#### Debugging the Gender Gap

I found the film to be incredibly powerful.  I took away that as a member of the so called status quo, or white middle class male, just being tolorant and accepting towards everyone is not good enough.  Inequality exists and simply not contributing to the problem does little to affect any meaningful change.  I need to be cognizant and proactive of this in my career or otherwise and work towards being an active agant of change.

## DTR From Paired Project

##Project: Ideabox

###Group Member Names: Nik Bornemeier and James Sullivan

###Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
###Nik would like to become more comfortable with JSON and Array prototype methods.
###James would like the same as well as some additional work with css, and simpler javascript.


###Goals and expectations: Get through phase 3 and possible work on an extension if time allows.

###How to overcome obstacles: Communicating to the other group member any obstacles that may arise
###and working with them to figure out the best method to go forward. Relying on peers and other
###cohorts to help with any issues that we can not find a resolution for.

###Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?): Monday afternoon
### Tuesday afternoon into evening, and Wednesday afternoon/evening as needed.  We will work separately
### on individual functionality as needed.

###Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?): We will communicate as needed during the day, and by Slack when/if we are working
###separately at night.

###Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): we will work together on HTML and CSS.  We will also work together on JS/JQ and will possibly work on individual functionality if needed
###and agreed upon.

###Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):  We will commit each
###others PR, we will push after each function is created.

###Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:  Be honest and respectful.


## Feedback From Paired Projects

### IdeaBox

James was a great project partner.  He is VERY good at being able to research/look up methods that he is unfamiliar with.  He was always able to verbalize any ideas that he had and I was quick to explain any issues that he told me he was having trouble with.  I feel like this was a very successful pairing and I look forward to working with James in the future.  The only constructive criticism I have for James is that he could work on his syntax. He sometimes will put things slightly out of order in JQuery or have a missing semi-colon.  These are issues that most mod 1 students are dealing with and I believe he will naturally become better with syntax as he gains more experience.  Overall a GREAT experience.

### ToDoBox

James you are truly a joy to work with.  I loved that you were willing to stick it out super late with me until the project was where we wanted it.  Having an equally committed partner helped us get an outstanding project delivered with time to spare.  Your growth in Javascript during the project was really awesome.  You added several challenging functions, and your reverse slice reverse was hilarious and brilliant. I think it showed that you truly understood how the methods worked.  All I can advise is to keep practicing your coding and you will keep learning at that awesome rate.  Looking forward to our next project together!


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was really blown away by the community spirit here at Turing.  I've supported the community by being an active participant. I take our classwork and gearups seriously and try to perpetuate the dialouge with thoughful consideration. I try to help my classmates when I can be emotionally supportive in times of need.  As I begin settling into my new developer identity, I feel I can be myself more and more, which better euips me to better engage in the community.
