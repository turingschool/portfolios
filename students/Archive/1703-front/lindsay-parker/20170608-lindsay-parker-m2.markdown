Implementing a prefix tree.  This was definitely a challenge, but the rewards of small wins were great!

Implementing three types of sort: Insertion, Merge & Quick.  It was great how our cohort helped each other through each of these, and for me to learn the advantages and disadvantages of the different types.

Introduction to React & APIs, and designing our own static comp!  I enjoyed this one, and definitely learned a lot.

HTML Canvas.  Probably the most fun project of the mod, just because we got to play our games along the way!

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### 1) Empathy
Emily Freeman did a wonderful job of emphasizing the importance of empathy in our daily work and lives.  It was disheartening to hear of her experiences as the only woman on her work team, but I appreciated her ability to move through it.  This Gear Up also lead to some great conversations with my cohort-mates that had different experiences around the subject of diversity.


#### 2) Parable of the Polygon
My notes...

>Tech executives, based on the sample, if they wanted 1/3 to be like them, then sooner or later the whole team will be like them... so if you aren't like them, then your likelihood of getting that job is pretty poor.  Or maybe more so your likelihood of sticking around...

>Diversity quotas, I wonder if diversity quotas in a vacuum would work?  That if you take out human nature and societal influence, they'd be a great idea?  But diversity quotas that are too small aren't meeting the needs of the minority necessarily.

>Other strategies for counteracting bias?  No clue...

>Knowledge & understanding, do we make it a point to only seek jobs where we won't be the only x, y or z?  When we get to the point of influencing hiring practices, do we encourage the diversity quota with the anti-bias mind?

>Technology to illustrate complex ideas?  The goals of 'Parable of the Polygons' to me were imparting on the user the effects of the smallest bias on a community as a whole.  I think it was very effective, but likely not a long term impact.  But then what really is?


#### 3) Lending Privilege
My notes...

>I appreciated in the second video that the speaker explained that even though none of us are the reason biases exist, we all have to deal with it and can only overcome it together.  The first video seemed over-exaggerated, but I imagine that was for effect.

>Personal experience, yes I absolutely have it... though I think it's challenging to see the impact of privilege in a vacuum...do you have to be compared to someone else to be with or without privilege in any area?


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part 
_ways you supported the larger Turing community_

This module was my second round as a representative to the Student Advisory Board for 1703 Front-End.  I volunteered to create seating charts and place markers for the Code Fair.  In addition, I fully attended community events like guest speakers and spikes.

### Feedback
#### Weathrly
JC and I provided verbal feedback throughout the project.  His feedback to me was all positive, around communicating, organization and technical foundations.  The feedback I provided early on was around communicating schedule changes and he very much made that change which helped me not get bothered :)

#### Game Time
Cole and I provided verbal feedback throughout the project.  The feedback I received was around voicing my opinion more, and I made a point to do so.  The feedback I provided was around vocalizing his thought process so I could be on the same page and I appreciated that he was making attempts to improve in that area.

#### Mod 1 Pairing
Carmen Wilson
> Lindsay's tutoring is clear, easy to follow and enjoyable. She explains subjects in a manner that helps you to understand. Thank you, Lindsay.

Margo Schaedel
> Lindsay was a great pairing mentor for me, as she really gave me a lot of constructive feedback on my project, and offered guidance rather than just going ahead and changing what needed to be revised. She has a great teaching style, asking me a lot of questions, so that I could work through some of the problems myself with her help.

Laura Caroselli
> Lindsay, you were so awesome and patient during my pairing session with you! I appreciate how you asked questions to guide me to my own answers and let me test ideas out as we went along. Your feedback was helpful and I feel much more comfortable with traversing the DOM thanks to you! Keep doing great work.

Ana Jauregui
> Lindsay, I really appreciated our pairing session in which you helped me with making my static comp responsive. You did a wonderful job explaining your thoughts about how to approach the issues I had, and I have benefitted from your suggestion to make quick changes in the console rather than spending time committing changes and going back and fourth. It was great that you worked with the thought processes I had going and were able to jump in where I was struggling.
