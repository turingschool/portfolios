# Lindsay Parker - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
_What did you set out to accomplish this module?_

My goals for this module were to (1) pass it, (2) still enjoy the problem-solving and coding aspects by the end of it, and (3) to work hard and not feel like I left anything behind.  At this point, I feel as though I've accomplished what I set out to in this module.

Static comp recreation of a recruiter's job-posting dashboard.  I enjoyed the challenge of this project, and the usability of it as well.  Displaying data and information in a clear and actionable way makes a huge difference in business.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects were a nice way to start this program smoothly and with less risk.  After having some good partnerships, though, I appreciate the value of team assignments and see how two heads can be better than one.

A quick but appropriately challenging introduction to JavaScript.  This final product didn't have the level of fine-tuning that I strive for, but overall I happy with where I got.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

As mentioned previously, I very much appreciate the power of working with a partner.  Depending on the group dynamics, so much can be accomplished.  Even with partnerships that had weaker dynamics, I learned an incredible amount.

Instagram-like.  This project taught me about event bubbling & prepend, more than anything.  The biggest challenge and resulting win though was figuring out how to direct the browser to the correct image file to upload.  The solution isn't scalable, but hard-coding the file path worked like a charm.

_feedback to me_

"I learned a lot about time management and organization and realistic expectations from you. AND GITHUB dâ€™oh. Your problem-solving skills are top notch. We had a good balance of driver-navigating and remote coding, that was cool. We also had a good balance of working on all three files, so I got well-balanced practice even though I am not so equally skilled at all three. You supported me in where I was at and helped me push myself. You also gave me space to practice commands and get better at that while we worked together. Our schedules and communication styles worked well together. Having a good bit of the comp done when we started was a helpful surprise, but if I could do it over again, starting together from scratch might have made it feel more equally ours."

All the joys of localStorage.  The largest technical challenge for this piece was making editable content persist, but we solved that with an event listener for _focusout_.  The largest challenge overall was making sure I understood all of the code in our project, as some of it was written individually.

_feedback to me_

"Lindsay was a pleasure to work with. She is a natural leader, and her ideas improved the productivity and functionality of the project. I admire her project management skills, which helped build the structure of our project, and made the workflow feel more efficient and smooth. She has a very great eye for detail, and fixed a lot of bugs in our JavaScript file that improved the functionality of our project. I appreciate her consistency in maintaining a firm process of pushing branches. It improved the organization and balance of our contributions in GitHub, and prevented potential errors of overriding files in our master branch. This is a great practice, which I will strongly implement in my future projects. Regarding coaching feedback for my partner and opportunities to improve, in her next project, she could consider being more vocal with her partner if there are some concepts that need more explanation. I tend to go fast as navigator when writing JavaScript code, and I always like to check with my partner if my explanations and though process is clear, or if I am going too fast. In some occasions, I wasn't always sure if she was understanding my ideas. However, by the end of the project, we both completely knew our code from top to bottom, and were able to explain its functionality. Overall, I am glad she was my partner. I learned a lot from her way of working, and I will apply her project management style in my future projects."

Refactoring, and lots of it.  I enjoyed the refactoring piece though; it solidified my understanding of how the code interacts.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### 1) Growth Mindset

This Gear Up has definitely stuck with me throughout the inning.  As a generation that was raised in the fixed mindset, it's been very eye-opening for me to try to see things differently.  I also enjoy hearing cohort-mates seriously talk about the growth mindset; I think this topic was a great way to start.

#### 2) Getting Better at Difficult Things

Looking back at my notes from this Gear Up, the two things that stick with me the most are (1) the importance of a very high quantity of high quality examples, and (2) the impact of fear on learning.  With respect to (1), I don't thing Turing has made it a point to collect a high quantity of high quality examples.  The gap between the examples in our lessons and the quality of work we do on our own assignments would not suggest that the examples are high quantity nor high quality.  As for (2), I can acknowledge that it's harder for me to learn when I'm in an emotional place where risk or failure scare me.

#### 3) Working Styles

The reading from this Gear Up was very informative, and I felt that it rounded out a lot of personality tests that I've taken.  This was actually more beneficial to me than the Strengths Finder exercise.  I'm strongly in ambivert, and now I know what that means!

#### 4) Storytelling and Strengths

I appreciated the importance of 'having a story,' but more important to me is living my story.  I think someone that lives their story genuinely and with an interest in sharing their stories with others, doesn't necessary fall into the category of storytelling.  Maybe it was a framing issue for me?

#### 5) Code Debugging the Gender Gap

The video for this Gear Up was definitely valuable to watch.  As a female with a background in engineering, the gender gap is one that I'm incredibly familiar with, but I was a bit disheartened to learn that the gap is as prevalent in coding as it is.  Moving forward, I'll continue to pursue my passions with a healthy disregard for the limiting beliefs of others, and work and wish for the best.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part 
_ways you supported the larger Turing community_

This module I was a representative to the Student Advisory Board for 1703 Front-End.  In addition, I fully attended community events like guest speakers and spikes.
