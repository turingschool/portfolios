# Lindsay Parker - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
_What did you set out to accomplish this module?_

My goals for this module were to (1) pass it, (2) start getting an idea for where I'll look for work, and (3) have a personal project that I'm excited about.  At this point, I feel as though I've accomplished what I set out to in this module.

Create a successful web application from a person project idea.  My project--'Back Home'--provides an environment in which to view various architectural and interior design styles across multiple categories (exterior, by room, chairs, lighting, etc.).

Introduction to Redux & PostgreSQL.  Definitely the hardest project to date, with the introduction of Redux, a back-end, and three-person teams.  In the end, it was a satisfying project and I'm happy with our results.

Introduction to `Promise.all()`. I had a great time with this project, despite the challenging schedule with the Fourth of July holiday.  Once we started chipping away at the Promises, progress was steady.

React practice.  After a two-week break, this was a nice project to get back on track with.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up Notes
#### 1) Microagressions
> I'm honestly trying to think of microagressions I've experienced at Turing at
> Turing or in my life recently, and I can't.  Hopefully this is because there
> haven't been any, but more likely because I either haven't noticed them for
> what they are or have forgotten them all together.

> I will always remember though, the first semester of my freshman year in
> college, so almost 15 years ago (when I can barely remember conversations
> I've had last week) when a teammate told me, in no uncertain terms, that I'd
> "never be an engineer."  One small comment but I've never forgotten it.

#### 2) Allyship
> **1)** I would say all "the talk" is exactly what we are trying to do at Turing.
> It's an important part of the Turing community and the choice I made to be
> here.

> Ignoring the situation would probably make the student feel like his opinion
> wasn't heard and want to tell it to someone else, spreading it even more.

> **2)** Hopefully I would have had conversations with that classmate in the past
> and asked them what would be a plausible alternative, then suggest that
> instead?

> Ignoring this would likely begin to form a rift where that classmate doesn't
> feel included in the group.  The tension could fester into a much worse
> outcome.

> **3)** Honestly, I'd probably say it is pretty weird but most of the day to
> day at Turing is already  "boys club" and because of the environment for
> women, it's helpful to have a space where we can talk comfortably.  I might
> ask if there are things this person would want to talk about and have the
> support of a community and does that sort of community already exist? 

#### 3) Resilience at Turing
> **1)** Initial reactions were how perfect this was after reading "Rising
> Strong" and how I can work to improve my bounce back.  Experiences?  I've done
> some things that have required resilience, but more in the form of
> determination.  I don't think I've risked enough to fall and need to bounce
> back.

> **2)** What value on personal resilience?  A lot, even thought I'm not
> confident I can pinpoint what it actually is.  But I think it is critical to
> not giving up.  It is critical to living a life worth living.  All that "the
> untested man" quotes come to mind.

> **3)** Mental practices?  Yoga, 5 whys.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part 
_ways you supported the larger Turing community_

I participated fully in Turing community and posse events this module.

### Feedback
#### MovieTracker
JC, George and I had a feedback session part-way through the project, that resulted in primarily positive feedback.  Having three people made it challenging to have everyone involved in the more critical tasks, but when I felt excluded on one such effort, I shared my feedback immediately and it was well received.

#### SWAPI-Box
Travis and I provided verbal feedback throughout the project.  We worked together very well, so all of our feedback for each other was positive.

#### Headcount
Joe and I provided verbal feedback throughout the project.  We also worked together very well, so our feedback was very positive.
