# Lindsay Parker - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
_What did you set out to accomplish this module?_

My goals for this module were to (1) pass it & GRADUATE (!!!), (2) get some job interviews, and (3) continue to strengthen my relationships with cohort-mates.  (1) is feeling good as of now.  (3) was easy to do.  (2) didn't turn out, but I did a lot of warm- and cold-outreach and met with some great people.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up Notes
In Mod 4, we were responsible for planning and facilitating a Gear Up for students in lower mods.  The group I elected to join was around the topic of "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*\*\*."  It's a topic that resonates with me, and one that I can be very good at or very bad at, depending on the circumstances.  As the only front-end person on my team, it was interesting and challenging to work with my back-end counterparts. Overall, the Gear Up was very successful though, and received great feedback from Ellen Mary's survey results. 


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part 
_ways you supported the larger Turing community_

* Participated fully in Turing community and posse events
* Attended Joan Clarke Society events
* Volunteered to be on the Q&A panel for two Try Coding events
* Participated in focus group with member of Turing board

### Feedback
#### BYOB
George and I had feedback sessions part-way through the project as well as after its close that resulted in entirely positive feedback.  Having only worked together previously on Movie Tracker (a three-person team), George and I hadn't had the opportunity to adapt our styles cohesively, but after BYOB, it was clear we were both very happy with the partnership and the product.

Feedback from George:
> Lindsay you are my favorite partner.  I think our work styles mesh very well together.  You are very focused person and that helps me because I like to go off in directions and try crazy stuff, which can lead to being unproductive.  I really appreciated you sticking it out with me for so long over the weekend to fix our lingering bugs.  I thought our project turned out really well!

#### House of Vars
As a quick-turnaround project where the entire team was outside their comfort zone, Justyna, Juan and I came together considerably well but did not provide explicit feedback to each other throughout the project.

#### Capstone: Club Reads
Ciara, Dave, Travis and I have not yet provided explicit feedback to one another.  But overall, I feel the team would say that the project is going well.
