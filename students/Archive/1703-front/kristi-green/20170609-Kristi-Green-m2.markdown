(Kristi Green) - (M2) Portfolio

Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
To try and learn/retain as much of the curriculum being taught for Mod2 and to utilize what I learned in Mod1 to accomplish the projects assigned.

Rubric Scores

A: End-of-Module Assessment: PASS
B: Individual Work & Projects: 3
C: Group Work & Projects: 4
D: Professional Skills: PASS
E: Community Participation: 

A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)
I feel I should pass Mod 2

B: Individual Work & Projects

(Game Time)

(Game Time was a major accomplishment for me because I had never built a computer game.  At first, we didn't know where or how to start but we pulled up docs and turned to classmates for assistance. After a bit we were able to work independently on various aspects of the project.  I am ver proud of the way the project turned out.)

https://github.com/kristing40/game-time
Original Assignment
(We want your game to be full-featured and playable — not just a proof of concept of the gameplay and rendering features.

To this end, make sure to include sufficient UX to allow the user to fully interact with the game. This would include:

Indicate when the game is over and won or lost
Allow the user to start a new game
Include a clean UI surrounding the actual game interface itself
Create multiple rounds of difficulty (consider increasing factors such as game speed, randomness of starting setup, etc.).)

Functional Expectations

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

(feedback to me)
Continue to learn and develop as a developer


(Sorting Suite)

(This was an algorithms challenge and it was tough the idea was to use recursion to break and array of numbers down in a particular pattern and then build the array back up to it's original form)

Evaluation Rubric

1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
2. Test-Driven Development

3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
4. Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

(Complete Me)
(This assignment taught us how linked lists/trie's are built and how to set up an autocomplete feature to help the end user in their relevant search for something in a dataset.)

Instructor Evaluation Points: Complete-me

Instructor: Nathaniel

Comments:

1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
2. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
5. Code Sanitation

(Weatherly)
(Intro)

https://github.com/kristing40/weatherly
Original Assignment
(Build and application that pulls in an api to get weather data. Create a pleasing interface that the use can interact with and is easily manipulated to get the data the user is seeking.)

Comments:

Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

JavaScript / React Style

// break out search/controls component, contains input field and search button // use map SevenHourDisplay and TenDayDisplay

2 - Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing. The application has large components and logic could be broken out to smaller stateless components.

Testing

// pass in array of hours into SevenHourDisplay and array of days into TenDayDisplay, // check seven hours rendering, ten days... // controls pass in function, ran once // use .find, .length, .at, .text

2 - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints

E: Community Participation

Joe Heitkamp

Kristi provided a level head and calming influence for me as I struggled incorporating new concepts into my work. She showed both vulnerability and strength as we worked through the many stressful moments of the inning. Working on Mythical Creatures with Kristi was a fantastic exercise and gave us both great practice at talking through our logic and code. Kristi rocks!!!!!

Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
Attended several Joan Clarke Society Meetings.  Wrap up and consistent engagement with Turing School students while at school and outside of school.
