# (Evan Miller) - (M3) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

During Mod 3, I set out to increase my JavaScript skills using React, Redux, and Tdd. My goal was to get more and more comfortable with async, fetch requests, and component organization. In the final weeks, I decided to incorporate all the things I have learn thus far and blend them together with my love for hardware. Thus, the 'Another Yung Magic Mirror,' was born.

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

### (Magic Mirror)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/EvanSays/magic-mirror)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

#### About 


I wanted to combine my love of hardware with the JavaScript skills I have learned in the past 4 months at Turing Software and Design.

The mirror is designed to run off a single Raspberry Pi 3 with Rasberian OS. Electron bundles the React/Redux program, enabling the software to run on the pi.

The mirror displays current and daily weather, news, a clock, and github pull request notifications.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

### (Headcount)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/EvanSays/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

Headcount is a card list using React that displays Colorado District data. This project helped me get familiar with using small reusable pieces of code, tdd workflow, and prop-types

### (Swapi-Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/buji405/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

Using React and the Star Wars Api, we built a card list that rendered pieces of the Api using async promise.all(). 

### Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Design

3.5 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

### Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### (Movie Tracker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/noetic97/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

**MOVIE SPEC**:

```
Iteration 0:
* Pull in movie API
* Pull most recent movies from MovieDB API.
* Display each movie on root index /

Iteration 1:
* Sign In / Sign Out Functionality
* Be able to sign in on page /login and redirect user to /
* Flash "Email and Password do not match" - if password is incorrect
* Ability to create a user.
* Flash "Email has already been used" - if email has been taken
* Should only take legit emails - regex - Extension

Iteration 2: Favorites
* Each movie should be displayed with a favorite button.
* If the user is not signed in and clicks on a favorite button the user will be prompted with the request to create an account.
* Validate favorites before adding to db. Aka does that user already have the movie stored as favorites.
* If the user visits /favorites they should see a list of all their favorite movies.
* Once on /favorites the user should have the option to delete the movie.
```

#### Specification Adherence  

* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

#### Redux Architecture


* 3.5: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

#### Routing

* 3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.


#### JavaScript Style

* 3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

#### Workflow

* 3: The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.


## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### (Microagressions, Allyship, Looking Good)

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I supported the Turing community with attending SAB meetings, making class surveys for feedback, and hosting our class gear up seesions.
