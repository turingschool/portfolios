# Travis Gregory - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for mod 4 were to develop a solid understanding of backend javascript in express and better solidify my jQuery skills while actively hunting for a job, hopefully attaining one by program end.

#### Goals for Module 5
* Continue to build up my confidence in what I know
* Give back to the community through open source and volunteering at coding events
* Continue learning new technologies and languages

## Rubric Scores

*   **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
*   **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
*   **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
*   **D: Professional Skills**: 3
*   **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 2.5

<!-- ### Deployment (40 points)
#### 40: Application is automatically deployed to production via CircleCI.
#### 20: Application is deployed to Heroku but not automatically via CircleCI.
#### 0: Application is not building with CircleCI and not deployed.
### JavaScript Style (60 points)
#### 50: Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all modular pieces separated out into logical components. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
#### 35: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
#### 15: Application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what most lines are doing.
#### 10: Application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs. Developer cannot speak to most choices and does not know what every line of code is doing.
#### 5: Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity.
#### 0: There is little or no client-side code. Developer writes code that is difficult to understand. Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together.
### User Interface (60 points)
#### 40: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
#### 30: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
#### 20: The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.
#### 0: The application is confusing or difficult to use.
### Risk Taking and Creativity (10 points)
#### Instructor/developers will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

#### 10: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
#### 5: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
#### 2: Developers attempted to implement feature using technologies not covered in class but it did not result in a delivered feature.
#### 0: Developers did not use a new technology.
### Testing, Linting and Error Handling (40 Points)
#### 40: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit, client-side and server-side). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application. A linter has been enforced and passes with no errors.
#### 20: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. Most functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing. A linter has been enforced but may contain some errors or warnings.
#### 10: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested. A linter was enforced but it does not pass in multiple places.
#### 5: Testing in the application is sporadic and does not add confidence that the application would not break during refactoring. A linter was not enforced.
#### 0: There is little or no evidence of testing in this application. A linter was not enforced.
### Workflow (40 Points)
#### 40: The developers effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There is visible evidence of code review happening in pull requests and discussion around approaches. Commit messages are consistent and there are no instances where developers are committing debuggers or commented out code.
#### 20: The developers make a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. There is little evidence of code review. Commit messages may be somewhat inconsistent and at times, the codebase contains debugger code.
#### 10: The developers make large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application. There are formatting or code styling issues in the code base. (This is important. These issues should not be able to make it past code review.)
#### 5: The developers committed the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
#### 0: The application was not checked into version control.
### To get a 3 on this project, you need to achieve 200 / 250

### Final Score: x / 250 -->

## B: Group Work & Projects

## Name: JetFuel
[GitHub URL](https://github.com/tlgreg86/jet-fuel)

[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/jet-fuel.html)


### Student: Travis

### Evaluator: Brittany

### Scores:

### Specification Adherence

**40 points**: There is one feature missing from the base expectations that makes the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### User Interface

**12 points**: The application shows effort in the interface, but some aspects of the UI make the interactions confusing. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.

### Data Persistence with SQL Database

**20 points**: The application persists data in a SQL database but with correct relationships between folders and URLs.

### Annotated Server File

**8 points**: Each line of the server file (on a separate branch) is commented and explains the code using mostly accurate terminology

### Testing

**18 points**: Project has a running test suite that tests every server-side endpoint with many happy and sad path cases.

### JavaScript Style

**15 points**: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

**14 points**: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are some formatting issues in the code base.

# Final Score: 127 / 160 (PASS)

## Name: BYOB
[GitHub URL](https://github.com/JustynaField/BYOB)

[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/build-your-own-backend.html)


### Student: Travis

### Evaluator: Brittany

### Scores:

### Documentation

**5 points**:  The README documentation is sparse in the information it provides and formatted in such a way that the instructor can not easily use every endpoint based on following the documentation.

### Feature Completion

**60 points**: Developer has implemented all 10 endpoints, 4 are secured via JWTs and one is a custom endpoint that filters data based on query params. The database is seeded with at least two tables and one relationship.

### Testing & Linting & Error Handling

**30 points**: Project has a running test suite that covers all happy and sad paths for the appropriate endpoints, though some of the assertions are too vague or lacking to be informative. The project has a linting configuration that passes with no errors.

### JavaScript Style

**25 points**:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

# Final Score: 110 / 150 (PASS)

## Name: House of Vars
[GitHub URL](https://github.com/Code4SocialGood/c4sg-web)

[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/house-of-vars.html)

### Student: Travis, Joe, George, Bucket

### Evaluator: Brittany, Robbie

### Scores: (PASS)

## C: Professional Skills

I spent a good chunk of my time interviewing at Cognizant Quickleft in Boulder and wound up getting an offer there that I accepted. Meg excused me form the professional development deliverables. I did however attend Jeffs Mod 5 talks in the mornings.

## D: Gear Up

### The Robots are Coming

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1708-inning/group_five.md)

This was the gear up that I co-hosted. The talk revolved around automation and machine learning and how it could affect us as developers and how it could affect the world around us now and in the future.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

I ran 1 and cohosted 1 IronFE session and participated in many others. I also paired with a few of the mod 1 students on projects and code practice.

### Playing a Part
I wasn't as active during this module as I had been in previous ones not due to senioritis, but because of family issues and workload. I do plan on becoming a mentor post Turing though.
