# Joe Heitkamp - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For module 3, I wanted to continue to build on my fundamental JS skills as well as become comfortable working with React and Redux. In terms of community interaction, I aimed to be an available resource to those in lower mods throughout the inning and kick some ass as a SAB rep.  

## Rubric Scores

# A: End of Module Assessment

I feel confident that I am ready to move on to the next module.  I achieved the goals that I set for myself this inning and though still a beginner in many respects, am sure of my own abilities to problem solve and persevere during times of struggle.


# B: Individual Work & Projects

The projects this inning were fun!  Each one seemed to build on our skills in a very progressive manner, while offering a great challenge.  I was promised a serious hatred for my instructors by week 5, but they did an amazing job of keeping us motivated and offering the right level of support without spoon feeding us solutions. The projects this inning helped me understand that I can be a developer without training wheels even if it means I crash a bit.

  
## _The Comic Connect_ - Self Directed Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/noetic97/comic-connection)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

The Comic Connect is a self directed project using a culmination of the technologies that we had used to this point while adding some backend elements with Express and Knex.  The app is built with React, Redux, and React-Router.  It uses the Comic Vine API, which was quite possibly designed in such a way as to lead developers to heavy drink or medication to regain sanity.

## D: Professional Skills
We started getting serious about our job search and making sure that we have the groundwork laid out for a successful transition out of Turing.  Reworking my resume and thinking about how I present as a developer gave me pause to really look deep at the ways I can make an impact in the overall tech community. Giving and receiving feedback continued to play an integral role in developing my professional skills.  

### Gear Up

#### MicroAgressions
  * This gear up was pretty good for such a pointless topic.  Get it? I was being super micro aggressive!  In reality, I found this gear up really eye opening.  It can be difficult to know when we are being aggressive or if our actions can be taken that way even when we don't mean them to be.  The main takeaway I got was to try to be aware of your actions and how they affect those around you.  This isn't something we can necessarily get perfect, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to. 

#### Allyship
  *  Being an ally is about listening. Understanding instead of assuming goes a long way in being an ally.  Allyship is not a one time action.  It is the act of trying, failing, trying again, succeeding, trying again, failing again, and improving the whole time.  

#### Being a Newb in Tech
  *  I feel pretty strongly that we can start giving back at any time in our development.  Even by mod 2, I understood that I didn't know much of anything, but I could be a huge help to mod 1 students.  This was a great gear up that reinforced that idea and gave several actionable ideas to build on in giving back to the community regardless of where your own personal development is at.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was blown away that mod 2 students took my lead from last mod and put together study sessions for mod 1 students to cover mythical creatures.  They even used the materials I created!!  I didn't feel like I took as direct a role in helping lower mods this inning as I did last inning, but I made it a point to regularly stop into mod 2 and mod 1 FE classrooms to offer help throughout the inning.  As an SAB rep this inning, I also took it upon myself, with the help of Evan Miller, to coordinate the logistics for the code fair.  There is some room for improvement there, but it still went off well.
