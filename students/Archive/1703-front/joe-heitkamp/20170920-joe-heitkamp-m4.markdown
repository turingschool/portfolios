# Joe Heitkamp - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For module 4, I was incredibly excited to build back end API's and full stack applications. Since the beginning of Turing, I've been waiting to put all of the pieces together and it seems that this is exactly what mod 4 did. My goals were to understand and be able to create an application with a full cycle of development from front to back end. In terms of community interaction, I aimed to be an available resource to those in lower mods throughout the inning and kick some ass as a SAB rep.

# A: End of Module Assessment

I felt behind the curve for the majority of the mod. Throughout Turing, I've ben able to keep my head above water while kicking furiously. For Mod 4, my kicking started to feel less effective and I drank a ton of water. While the final assessment had some issues to fix to receive a passing score, building that garage was an amazingly fun challenge that gave me a ton of confidence in my ability to problem solve and develop a thing. I feel ready to enter the tech scene as a humble junior dev with a hunger to continue learning.


# B: Individual Work & Projects

  
## _Jet Fuel_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/noetic97/jet-fuel)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/jet-fuel.html)

Jet Fuel was a URL shortener application with both a server and client side.  I was late in completing this project and severely underestimated the time needed to focus on the client side code. It was a great experience in getting my feet wet with backend code and connecting a full stack.  

#### Score: _pass_


## _Pattrn Party_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/noetic97/pattrn-party)
* [GitHub pages](https://noetic97.github.io/pattrn-party/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/pattrn-party.html)


Pattrn Party was a 3+ week project that had us creating our own style guide that showcased an accordion tab, flexible boxes, and header bar.  All of the components needed to be responsive.

#### Score: _pass_

# C: Group Work & Projects

## _BYO-Backend_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/noetic97/byo-backend)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/build-your-own-backend.html)
* [Heroku Deployment](https://winter-resort-api.herokuapp.com/)

BYO-Backend got us deep into the backend.  Well, probably not really that deep, but deeper than we had been before.  I felt really comfortable throughout this entire project and definitely appreciated all of the verbose feedback.  I will not forget a catch block on a promise ever again!

QUIZZAM!!!!!

## D: Professional Skills
We really ramped up our efforts at professional development this mod. The amount of time put into developing plans for after graduation will be a huge help to keeping on track to getting a job quickly.  I have a huge list of to-dos coming out of Turing that has come from Turing staff, mentors, and friends. To name a few:

- build a personal website with full backend, CI, test suite
- code everyday using the issues on past projects as a great start
- research companies daily
- cold outreach goals for each week
- put together a lightning talk for a meetup
- network, network, network
  

### Gear Up

Mod 4 gear ups were all about us setting up the end of inning gear up for mods 1-3. The topic we focused on was transhumanism. Transhumanism (abbreviated as H+ or h+) is an international and intellectual movement that aims to transform the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellect and physiology.

### Transhumanism

[Gist of gear up outline](https://gist.github.com/noetic97/f709edaa2acdd03b2d8f56f33b21364b)

#### Feedback - 

 - It's a complex topic with many opinions, concerns and points of view. We're most likely headed in the direction of complete technology integration. How, as developers, can we affect this positively?

 - best gearup ever

 - They let the conversation and discussion flow and deviated from their lesson plan to allow us to continue having a discussion on transhumanism.

 - Very open. Relaxed and did a good job allowing everyone to converse.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod, I found the posse as the most effective way to play a larger role in the Turing community. Being in the far off hallway for mod 4 keeps us slightly separated from the rest of the student body which makes it even more important to reach out to lower mods.  As a posse leader, I really took pride in engaging everyone in developing a solid weekly posse plan that everyone was excited about.  Most importantly, my posse co-leader and I worked across cohorts and posses to gather mentors for a Turing wide mentor Q&A that was well attended.
