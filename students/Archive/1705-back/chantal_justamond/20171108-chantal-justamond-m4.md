# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

This inning I was focused on finishing Turing strong, with a Capstone that I could be proud of. This has been the one thing I've been thinking all along.


## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
N/A

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
> Pace myself and preventing my brain to overcome my will with unconfident thoughts.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
> I was able to win and have a good assessment.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
> Remaining calm, and remembering that I can do this.

* What did you learn?
> I become stronger with every challenge I face.

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
> Quantified self wasn't that hard I think, although manipulating the DOM can be troublesome, so instead
> is better to manipulate the Data incoming from the server, and of course getting your code to production is
> always a challenge.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
> Learning how to google is key.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
> Being able to conquer it.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
> How to deal with async code.
> Ajax request in express.
> injecting data into the DOM.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
> I would've look up a tutorial to learn a bit more up front.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
> Having an experience partner was incredible, just because you can actually ask someone when you get stuck.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
> I would say the biggest one was to setup the webhook in my dev environment for the incoming data from sendgrid.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I was able to find [Local Tunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/), this allows the data from the webhook to be available for me to manipulate in my local dev environment.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
That I was in unknown waters and somehow I was able to overcome the obstacle.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
React, Redux, Mongo and Mongoose. I'm very happy with the outcome.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
I need to do better communnicating or articulating my knowledge. From day 3 I'll practice tech interviews verbal and written challenges. (Day 1 and 2 I'll be sleeping.)

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?
I thought the process of trying to make the gear up interesting and engaging really interesting. Trying to choose topics that will increase participation is really hard, but it's nice to learn so many new things along the way.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

I did a couple of pairing sessions with mod 1 people in my posse, but With capstone, there was just no time to give.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
I'm going to bring my grit, will power, enthusiasm and work ethics to any job I land. Turing taught me how to go from zero to hero in a short period of time and I want to continue doing that for the rest of my career.

## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [post grad plan](https://gist.github.com/chantal66/0672e33f69ae71538da76100e512ea00):

* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.
* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.

I am a software developer focused on personal development not only as a coder but as a human being. My transition from Economics and Marketing to programming has equipped me with a unique transferable skill set which includes creative problem solving and critical thinking.  I am looking forward to contribute as part of a team that builds original and strong software.
