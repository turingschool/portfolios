# Chantal Justamond - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> \<What did you set out to accomplish this module?>

> In this module I wanted to dive deeper into rails concepts and learn about consuming and building APIs. I also wanted to focus on concepts that might be relevant to the industry that I would like to work in.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)
> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
> **[Link to Repo](https://github.com/chantal66/api_curious_github)**
>* \<Description>
>* This project required us to create a clone of Github using github's API
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
>* I didn't originally get as far on this as I would have liked. I ran into trouble with the omniauth gem so I had to redo the project, however I got a better understanding of auth.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
> **[Link to Repo](https://github.com/chantal66/rails_engine)**

>* \<Description>
>* This project creates an internal analytics API for analyzing and serving sales data as JSON

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
>* Overall this project went really well and I enjoyed working on it.
I plan to look over the ActiveRecord and SQL portion of the project as this was definitely the hardest but also one of the most rewarding.

> **[80202](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/80202)**
> **[80202 Sprint 1](https://github.com/samanthagongora/turing_professionals)**
>* \<Description>
>* This is an app for Turing students to connect with one another post-graduation.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
>* Working with websockets has been a wonderful experience, been able to work with real time data is beyond I could've expect.

> **[80202 Sprint 2](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/80202)**
> **[80202 Sprint 2](https://github.com/JF-Lalonde/cloney_island_airbnb)**
>* \<Description>
Cloney Island is a brownfield development project aiming to clone much of the functionality and design of Airbnb's platform.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
>* The group experience I had was rewarding, we made some silly mistakes at the end but we took as a group and own it.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
> I guess my biggest takeaway from this gearup is that while microaggressions may sounds insignificant on their own, they can have a large cumulative affect.

> [Choose your own adventure](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/)
> I attended the "Failing with Grace" gear up on how we are programmed since we are children to be afraid of failure, when one of my best learning experiences here at Turing is that when we fail or we
make a mistake we retain the understanding of that mistake way more that if we didn't fail in the beginning.
