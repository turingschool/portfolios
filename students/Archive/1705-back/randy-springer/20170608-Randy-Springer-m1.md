# Randy Springer - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I tried to come in as open minded as possible. Because I knew I wasn't going to
understand most of this, if any of it. The growth mindset and talk Jeff
gave on day one was essentially how I tried to approach school.

## Rubric Scores

* **E: Community Participation**: 2

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Starting out with the individual work was pretty intimidating. Made worse by the fact I didn't ask enough questions. I didn't do as well as I had hoped on the individual projects.

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/randy-darsh/linked_list_2)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat)

Make a simple drum beat program using linked lists.

Working through inter 2 No Tests

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

    2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

2. Looping or Recursion

    3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

3. Test-Driven Development

    1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

4. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

    3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

5. Functional Expectations

    2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.


#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/randy-darsh/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

Make the game Battleship in Ruby.

REPL working for q and i, but not (p)lay
If going through Board class, prints board Two classes and a few methods, with 3 tests.

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

    2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

2. Enumerable & Collections

    1: Application demonstrates deficiencies with Enumerable and struggles with collections

3. Test-Driven Development

    2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

4. Git Workflow

    FAIL: Developer does not commit often, commits are overly large, poor commit messages. Drastic changes in code in a single commit.

4. REPL Interface

    1: Application's REPL has enough problems as to make play difficult

5. Breaking Logic into Components

    2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

6. Functional Expectations

    1: Application does not run, crashes on start.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects went way better for me than the individual ones. Working with someone else to bounce ideas off of/collaborate with was infinitely easier than working by myself.

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wratterman/NightWriter)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer)

Writing a program to convert Braille to English and vice versa.

Broken into classes with nice short and descriptive methods 34 passing tests, 6 errors Reads and Writes Does not truncate to 80 char a line

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

    3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

2. Test-Driven Development

    2: Application makes use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

    3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

4. Functional Expectations

    2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.

## D: Professional Skills

I like working with people. I'm good at working with groups, as proven by how I did in the group projects vs. the individual ones. I like to work hard, I think me and JF said on our DTR we were gonna be here until 7pm at the latest every day. We stayed past 7pm almost every day including the weekend. I think I've also fully embraced the growth mindset. I know most of the reason I was struggling was just frustration and being able to take a step back and change the way you think is very very helpful.

### Gear Up

#### Turing Citizenship #1: Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

I think this one was the most useful for me besides the personal storytelling one we did later. I still have to tell myself everyday: "I just don't understand YET." I know if I keep immersing myself I will get this. It took me about a year at my last job before I fully know what was going on and I feel like it will be about the same thing here. Although, it is

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

I liked this one because it just further proved in my mind that learning by doing is the best way to learn. I'm pretty sure this was the one where the lady was talking about "chicken sexers" and it made a lot of sense.

#### Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

This one was pretty good too. I didn't even know ambiverts was a thing and I also found out I'm more of an extrovert than I thought. Talking with some of the other students made me realize though how draining meeting new people can be. And as a self identified introvert I completely agree.

#### Personal Stories & Connection

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

I liked this one the most I think. It's really cool to put into perspective what you have done and where you have come from. Sitting down and looking over how much we have done in just these 6 short weeks. It really has blown by. It makes me feel good that even if I have to repeat, I know where I am going and next time around will be more successful.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I didn't support as much as I would have liked too. Too much personal and school work going on for me. I hope to do more in this category next mod.

I made coffee several times if that counts! And the dishes too, because I felt guilty for missing the first time I was on the cleanup crew list.
