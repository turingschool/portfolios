>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
Most of the topics in Mod 3 were very relevant to being a real developer and I really enjoyed the lessons about things such as performance.
I felt as through a lot of the topics weren't things one could learn well from a tutorial and the real world experience of the instructors was particularly beneficial in this mod. The projects were challenging in terms of the group work and I felt the main takeaways were project management related.
>* \<Notes>

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
>* \<Description>
Used the Github API to re-construct a simplified version of the websiteâ€™s existing UI.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
This project was a great introduction to consuming APIs. By the end of the project I felt comfortable approaching most APIs.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* \<Description>
Uses Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
This project was extremely valuable in solidifying and strengthening my Active Record and SQL query skills. It was also a good introdution to building RESTful APIs.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://)**
>* \<Description>
A linkedin inspired professional network for Turing alumni.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
This project was challenging and educational for a variety of reasons. I definitely learned the value of management in a dev team, as with 6 people it became difficult to hold people accountable and make group decisions without anyone being in charge. My personal story was a great introduction to using ajax and allowed me another opportunity to work on more complex database queries. It was unfortunate that the project as a whole did not come together the way we expected and I learned the value of scaling back and focusing on the MVP.


> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://)**
>* \<Description>
A brownfield project that was a wine-themed clone of uncorked.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
This project was a good introduction to working on brown-field projects, and the associated challenges. Because our project was lacking a lot of base functionality and had a confusing user experience we spent most of our time completing the original base requirements to make it usable. I also had the opportunity to implement a feature in javascript that required programming logic in addition to AJAX calls, which served a good introduction to javascript.
