# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

I wanted to focus on learning Javascript and becoming qualified for full-stack development. I felt that I accomplished this, however for some of the projects I wasn't able to devote the amount of time and effort I normally would have due to  being super busy with jobs, the hackathon project, doing interviews and videos for Turing on Course Report, and doing some contract work for my old job. 

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
N/A

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you learn?

Is this for the Javascript assessment? If so, I didn't feel that it was particularly challenging. I learned how to break out my files which is something I didn't get around to on the QS frontend  It was a fun challenge because the end functionality was interesting and fun to use.

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

The biggest technical challenge was getting the backend endpoints fully working in production, as we ran into a lot of bugs. We solved this through trial and error. I enjoyed QS because it covered things I had already been doing in mod 3, but now I actually understood jQuery and JS best practices more. 

3 technical concepts: 
1. json_agg postgres method
2. Knex
3. Express

If I could change one thing it would be having the time to organize the frontend code. I wrote everything in the meals file and due to the fact that I spent so much time working on Mitig8 I didn't have any time to spare to refactor QS. I would have liked to practive OO JS on the frontend.

Working was a pair was fine, my pair was very comfortable with the concepts so we were pretty much able to divide and conquer and then we paired a little on debugging the production endpoint issues. 

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

My biggest technical challenge was dealing with asynchronous API requests in Node. I found it difficult to make these requests and then capture them in variables so I could manipulate them all together. I solved the challenge by googling and trying a million things and eventually finding promise.all to be a solution. I liked that challenge because asynchonicity is a totally new concept for me and I now want to dive deeper into promises.

3 technical concepts:
1. websockets
2. asynchronous requests
3. React

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

I received feedback to provide more depth when answering technical interview questions. I will act on this by practicing interview questions.


## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

The process of planning and facilitating the gear up was enjoyable, and I actually learned a lot from my classmates about our topic. I don't think anything about it was that challenging, but perhaps just deciding the general structure as our group had different opinions. It was rewarding to see everyone super engaged and interested, and to have people continue to post questions and updates in our channel afterward.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

* I served on SAB, and volunteered to lead an activity at the fall festival. 
* I reached out to a Mod 1 student that Ali asked me to pair up with and made myself available even though she did not end up asking for help. 
* I participated in Demo Night and the Code Fair. 
* I did an interview with Course Report about Not Here to Make Friends and made a screencast explaining some code from the project. I hope this helps inspire prospective students to envision the cool projects they can build here.

I think this is required because the students really make the community and without everyone contributing or participating in some way or another the Turing experience would be completely different.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

1. pairing
2. sharing and explaining my work
3. testing

## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md):

* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.
* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
