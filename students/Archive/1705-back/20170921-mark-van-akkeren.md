## C. **Gear Ups**

Group Think

As a black sheep i tend to not really drink kool aid or get on band wagons.  I've been fired from a job for raising a point about something that was wrong and now feeling more empowered wouldn't hesitate to make a bigger stand in the future.

UX/UI

Figuring out how to get inside the users head and walk a mile in their shoes. Design the experience and flow around their use.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
Frequent pairing on whatever topic i might be able to share on.  Drive consensus amongst diverse opinions and guide folks to their own solutions.  Getting others to believe in themselves.

#### **Posse**
  Absolutely nothing.  I asked in the slack channel at the beginning "hi, what are we doing? Where are we meeting?"  *crickets*. The old posse organization around cool topics and interesting spikes was way better.  

#### **Playing a Part**

Frequent (too frequent perhaps) collaborating with others to solve their problems.
