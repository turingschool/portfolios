# Michael Sagapolutele - M2 Portfolio

-----------------------

## A: Personal Growth

## Areas of Emphasis

I originally set out with only the goal of improving my technical skills, though part way through I started to put an emphasis on the growth of my interpersonal skills.

## Areas of Growth

Probably struggled the most with the move from pairs to groups, and reaching out to a mentor. On the technical side it would be with walking the Rails convention tight-rope.

I think I grew most in my ability to work with and manage the relationships of a group, and many work styles and learning styles. I think I've made some progress in my ability to speak about code, and communicate what I'm doing or thinking as I am doing it.

-----------------------

## B: Individual Work & Projects

These projects were pretty interesting, as well as frustrating. In the end they were really great practice and led me to dive into technical areas I didn't quite understand and come out the other side with more knowledge than I started with.

#### Bike-Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DesTodo/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

In this assignment we had to take some data from a bike share service in San Francisco and build out both CRUD functionality and light data analysis for a few different types of data (stations, trips, and weather). It was the first real introduction to working with databases.

My goal for this project was really to just get hands on the MVC framework and start to understand databases and how to structure them. My role was mainly trying to dive into the data analysis/active record side of things.

This project really kicked my butt. The change from pairs to groups threw me for a loop for most of this project because instead of trying to reconcile one viewpoint with my own I had to try to do that for 3 viewpoints. I think I started to take really strong stances and try to forge ahead (even though I wasn't the project manager) because I was having a hard time taking it all in. At the end of the day, this project really kicked me into gear and I started doing a lot of work outside of class to further my understanding.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MikelSage/pair-proposal)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

The Rails Mini-Project was mostly about exercising our Rails muscles and diving into things like database relationships and user authentication/authorization. I ended up choosing to pursue my own idea and tried to make a pairing app.

My goal for this project was to start building an instinct for better Rails code, and start to understand the patter of Rails applications. Also, I wanted to get better at associating tables and working with the associations between them. I also wanted to have something I might be able to expand on later, something that could help other people at Turing out.

This one was quite a doozy emotionally and technically. On the technical side, I ended up trying a lot of things I hadn't before like storing information on joins tables and using nested attributes. I went through quite a few iterations of database design. On top of that, this was the first project without any clear spec or direction to head (because I chose it myself). What surprised me was the lack of motivation I felt because of that. That was the emotional doozy; dealing with that lack of motivation and the feeling of not having the skills to pull off my own idea.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/swdonovan/scoots_shop)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

This project was an introduction to carts and using POROs to model things that don't persist in the database. This was an even bigger bite of authentication/authorization as well as using sessions to store information.

My goal in this project was to become even more with the MVC framework as well as work on my interpersonal skills. To accomplish the second goal, I volunteered to be project manager.

(reflection on project)
This one was quite a doozy as well. I had pretty good ideas, I thought so at least, coming in about how to effectively manage the project and keep the project on track while also allowing every group member to get as much hands on the code as possible. I feel like I accomplished this relatively well, but could most likely have done better about encouraging pairing and checking in with group members about areas they might have felt weak in. At the end, we got everything working and I was really proud of my group members.

-----------------------

## C: Final Assessments

(how did you do on written and timed independent?)
I did pretty well on both of them. Got all 4s on the timed independent which got me pretty stoked.
(was this a representation of your best work?)
For the most part, yeah. I could probably have been clearer on the written about sessions and probably the HTTP request/response cycle as well.
-----------------------

## D: Module Outcomes

I really think this module was interesting. I'm looking forward to building on the knowledge I gained and growing as a developer. I was actually terrified of reaching out to a mentor, but was able to do it and I'm pretty proud of myself for not chickening out.
