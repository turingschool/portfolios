# Michael Sagapolutele - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out this mod to become more comfortable with creating and consuming APIs and pushing myself to learn new skills, especially around client side code.

## Self-Assessment

| Section | Category | Score |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | Pass |
| B | **Individual Work & Projects** | 2 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 3 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 3 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 3 |

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
 This mod was the hardest one so far, in both technical challenge and group dynamics. The lack of a clear spec was eye opening in how important group organization is and how far I have to go in being a good team member.
>* \<Notes>
 Need to figure out how to speak up about organization without hurting the group dynamic.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
>* \<Description>
A rails wrapper for the Github API
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
It was great to get more experience hitting an external API and processing that information. Learned better patterns for parsing information from APIs.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
>* \<Description>
An internal rails api, serving up business records and light business intelligence related to those records.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
This was really invaluable experience later, really helped with SQL and activerecord syntax.


> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://palpit8.herokuapp.com/)**
>* \<Description>
Paplit8 is an app designed to pull chat logs from twitch streams and send them to the watson api to get a tone analysis for chunks of the chat. There is also a chat built using actioncable for users to chat about a particular game rather than just a particular stream.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
It was really great to get to work with actioncable and jQuery. Actioncable was also used to continously update the tone analysis of the room. It was hard to work with a group with such a different work style from mine.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://cloneyislandtravel.herokuapp.com/)**
>* \<Description>
Cloney Island Travel is an app centered around creating trips and adding attractions to each day of the trip. Our group added tours, oauth, welcome and itinerary emails, and the ability to see the attractions separated by day with a route between each of them using ajax, as well as the ability to remove attractions and see the updated route.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
It was really interesting to work on code written by somebody completely different. It was similar to untangling christmas tree lights. I want to get better at facilitating group organization without taking the reins myself.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Microaggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
  This was a great gear up for realizing just how much happens on a daily basis to underrepresented minorities. It was also eye opening how resistant people are to the idea that it affects people. Overall an eye opening experience.
> [Group Think](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/groupthink.md)
  This was a little weird in that it was very loosely run. It was a good subject, but I didn't really feel like there were a lot of solutions for small groups. It was helpful in identifying it though.
> [Robots Are Coming](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGHe1ZRtc5ysSaS3WoQHBVMl_498H7hW4c41AMZT-v0/edit#gid=1953176317)
  It was an interesting discussion about machine learning and automation. A few good ideas about the use of machine learning in education were brought up. My favorite was the idea of using ML to predict areas of difficulty in subjects for students and recommend exercises and materials to bolster learning.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
I have paired with Nicholas in Mod 1, Jim S in Mod3, Ericka Smith from Mod1, and Brandon Randall in Mod3. I have also floated around our class helping people with smaller problems on the spot.

#### **Posse**
  My Posse pretty much just hung out during our time. We started a board game and never finished it.
  Seeing a consistent group of people week to week.
  I recognize the need for some central vision in any group.
#### **Playing a Part**

Dan Alvarez and I went about trying to spread the word about a hackathon to other Turing students.
