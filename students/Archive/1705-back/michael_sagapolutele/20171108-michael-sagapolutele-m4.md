# Michael Sagapolutele - M4 Portfolio

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

Learning how to program well in a new language. I hope to have created relationships in the Ed Tech community.

## Assessments

### Word Watch

The JavaScript assessment was a pass for me. The biggest technical challenge was making sure there were no race conditions and making sure the deferred objects were handled correctly. I liked the way that it makes you think about async actions. I leveraged the techniques I'd learned during Quantified Self to make sure stuff only happened after all the deferred objects were resolved.

### Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you learn?

The Technical Communication Assessment was also a pass, and a great experience as well. As for technical challenges, the only one we were really presented with was the debugging challenge. My favorite thing about that was that I felt it was one of my strong points. My approach to this challenge was to start pulling all my known variables, tried to find the patterns, and then finding the difference. 

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

The biggest technical challenge on this one was probably wrapping my head around jQuery's deferred objects and how to handle multiple async calls. My approach to this one was to start aggregating information on deferred objects and promises and start to get an understanding of `.then` and `.done` and what they were actually doing and how I could handle multiple requests with `$.when` and the spread operator. I liked how this problem forced me to think outside the line by line approach Ruby had gotten me into. 3 technical concepts I learned during the project were the aforementioned `$.when` and Promise.all, the spread operator `...`, and closures (never ended up using them). I would liked to have spent more time thinking about how to organize the code well, and more time learning about testing. It was an interesting experience working with a pair on something completely new. There were a few times where we had to split up to tackle some new problem and then come back together when one of had a solution, but otherwise Matt and I worked together really well.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

So one of the biggest technical challenges ended up being understanding middleware and what it did, especially around the problem of authentication using passport. This approach was different because I didn't even know that it was a block to the way I was thinking until it was brought up in a tutorial on redux. Once I figured out this was a block, I sat down and started reading more about it. I didn't like much about this particular challenge, since I didn't know it was a block until much too late. Three technical concepts I learned during this project were React Router, managing state through passing down event handlers, and postgresql's functions for returning JSON.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

Probably the most meaningful feedback I received this Mod was from Lauren after the technical communication assessment. I'm going to take this feedback moving forward and try to incorporate it into the way I think about myself and how I approach the job search.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

The process of planning the Gear Up was a lot better than I originally thought it would be. We did our session on how technology can help social movements and I ended up with a passionate group of people planning it. We met more times than were allotted for the planning process so we had a pretty tight plan of how to go about everything. Actually presenting about something I was passionate in front of so many people was challenging, but it was worth it to see so many people end up being really passionate about the causes they chose. So much so we ran out of time at the end because people had so much to share.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

As with the Mods before, I mostly gave back to the community through pairing and helping people get through some of the tougher concepts. I also finally psyched myself up enough to give a lightning talk at wrap up!

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

- Working in a team setting
- Communicating technical concepts
- Paired programming

## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://gist.github.com/MikelSage/036ad37fea82375c90c8f9f48903d0ad):
* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.
* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
