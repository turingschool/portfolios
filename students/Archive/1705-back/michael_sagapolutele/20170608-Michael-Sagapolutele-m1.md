# Michael Sagapolutele - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to obtain a solid foundation in Ruby Style and Syntax, and to gain confidence that I wasn't developing any bad coding habits along the way. I think that my understanding of Ruby and OOD is much more solid than it was before coming here, and the feedback I've received from evaluations has made me more confident in my abilities.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Probably passed, I hope


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects were a bit of a roller-coaster. Credit check went well, DateNight was very taxing, and Battleship was where the skills developed in the previous projects really had a chance to be put to use. Looking back I can see a clear increase in skill over the course of these projects.

#### Credit-Check

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MikelSage/credit_check)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/credit_check)

This project was about using the Luhn algorithm to validate credit card numbers. It served as a good introduction to algorithmic thinking, loops, and learning about scope and how to pass information between methods.


#### DateNight

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MikelSage/date_night)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/date_night)

This project served as introduction to Binary Search Trees and how to create links and pass data between classes. We had to create a tree which consisted of movie scores, where each node had a score and up to 2 children. When a score was inserted it had to find its way through the tree.

- some use of predicate methods
- Smart node approach
- pull file io stuff to a different class
- Remember each method needs to be tested independently

##### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### 4. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MikelSage/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

This project involved recreating the classic Battleship game in code, complete with and AI player and a REPL. The AI player had to place their ship in random but valid placements. This is where I think encapsulation really started to click for me.

Good encapsulation, well balanced testing.

##### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

##### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

##### 4. Git Workflow

* PASS:  Developer demonstrates mastery of git and GitHub; commits with appropriate frequency, with clear, atomic commits that demonstrates a clear history.

##### 4. REPL Interface

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

##### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components such that individual pieces could be reused or replaced without difficulty

##### 6. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects were kind of a great experience. Having someone else to bounce ideas off of and work through problems with was great.

#### CompleteMe

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MikelSage/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/complete_me)

In this project we were required to build a re-Trie-val tree and implement something similar to an autocorrect system. Words would be input and nodes would be created for each character. Later, you could retrieve words with substrings by traversing the tree to the node of the last character of the substring and returning all the paths from there.

Best GUI ever. Logic was somewhat out of place.

##### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

##### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### 4. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jimszalew/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)

In this project we built an object relational mapper. We built classes for each type of data, and classes to store those instances. We also built a class to handle the relationships and a class to do some light business intelligence and data analysis.

Notes:
Said "Really well"  
Done through iteration  4  
Simplecov at 99.4  
34.7523s to run their test suite  
382 assertions 194 tests  
any, reduce, map, find, find_all  
Test Challenges: Fixtures difficult to align with needs  
Test Success: Broad scope, helped with ability to trace data  
Ruby & Style:  
Items as a hash - position wasn't going to matter, hash to array easier than array to hash, saves iteration on some of the find methods  
Method lengths are great, talked through how to refactor some longer methods - long methods aren't even that long  
Components:  
Good use classes   
Spoke to spec being fairly intuitive until Iter 4 - then got confusing what was actually being asked for

## D: Professional Skills
Each of the Gear Up sessions had great value in their own way. From learning about growth mindset to examining the differences between introverted and extroverted work styles there was always some great chunk of knowledge to be gleaned.

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

This was my first real introduction to growth mindset outside of the introduction to Turing on the first day. I began to realize the importance of facing these challenges as opportunities to grow. Failure should be just a stepping stone, and not the grievous wound to my pride as it had been before. I continue to try to be cognizant of my thoughts and to try to avoid falling back into the trap of a fixed mindset.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

This was also the first time I'd ever encountered the concept of cognitive resources in a scientific sense, though I had a vague notion of it before had. Since then I have tried to take seriously the management  of my resources and tried to find ways to regain some resources here and there. It was also nice to read in the article about how your outlook and emotional well-being can affect your ability to learn new skills. Having experienced that before, it really helped me to realize I need to stay on my toes when it came to my emotional state.

####  Intro, Extro, Ambiverts!

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

With this one I was familiar with the idea of introverts vs extroverts before heading into the session. I think it was great that we got to talk with those who had working styles opposite of ours. Getting to talk about the difficulties usually faced by our own working style while also hearing the struggles of those with an extroverted working style gave fresh perspective on many experiences I've had with group projects. I felt more prepared to work on a mixed team at the end of the session.

#### Personal Stories & Connection

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

This session presented a great opportunity to explore not only my own story, but to hear some of the stories of my peers. It is quite easy to get so caught up on what's happening now that you never look back and see how far you've come. It kind of put into perspective how much I've accomplished in my time here. It was also heartening to hear how similar many of our goals were, and the commonalities that flow through our entire community.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

An eye opener, this session was. I had heard of and had a vague notion of some of the issues surrounding women in software development as there's a very similar issue in the Physics community. Once of the things I had no idea about was the prevalence of women in the field before the rise of the male computer geek stereotype. Another thing was that on top of a pipeline problem, there's also a retention problem. There seem to be no easy answers, but I look forward to trying to solve these problems with others who care about a solution.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

While I can't say I did anything big to support the larger Turing community, I did try to go out of my way to help my fellow classmates as much as I could. I tried joining a posse but found I had less time than I thought I might. I did, however, volunteer to be a panelist in the upcoming Try Turing weekend for backend.
