# JF Lalonde - M2 Portfolio

-----------------------

## A: Personal Growth

## Areas of Emphasis

* I set out to become comfortable enough with Rails to be able to build a working web app, all the while trying to contribute back by pairing with mod 1 students. I believe I accomplished both of these things. I am proud of my rails mini-project and being able to get comfortable using bootstrap on a project as well as using an API to seed my database. I want to come back to this project to finish building out the "Favorites" functionality and keep adding to it as I learn more.
* I was also able to meet my goal of reaching out to mod 1 students. I paired on several occasions with different students and tried to provide them with leading questions and guidance without expressly giving them answers. I will continue to reach out to lower mods to pair during my time at Turing.

## Areas of Growth

* I struggled most with SQL queries, and it's probably still my weakest point. I found the in-class exercise using AR to be extremely helpful, and I plan to practice more over the break week to become comfortable querying join tables, etc.

* I think I grew in a couple of different areas this mod. I think things started clicking during the Rails mini-project and by the time the Little Shop project started I felt like I had a good grasp of how to go about creating a Rails project. I also have noticed that my critical thinking skills have improved during this mod. I find myself able to disect problems more successfully and I am beginning to understand the logic behind many of the processes we've learned this mod like sessions, authorization, and authentication.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Bike-Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JF-Lalonde/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/JF-Lalonde/bike-share)

Bike Share is an app built in Sinatra using Bay-Area data from a bike sharing organization. Our app includes analytics relating to weather, popular destinations, and correlating dates.

My goal this project was to become comfortable in Sinatra. My role was varied and involved focusing on seeding our database and creating ActiveRecord methods to analyze our data.

This project went well in the sense that I learned a lot from it. I felt like I didn't have the depth of knowledge that I should have had starting the project, and by the end I knew much more. I began to understand relationships within databases and how to create models in Sinatra that took advantage of those relationships to return relevant data.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JF-Lalonde/climbing_world)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

Climbing World is a rock climbing app that uses real-world data to allow users to create a list of favorite routes based on attributes like location, length, quality, and difficulty. They can then use those favorites to plan trips with their friends.

I wanted to get comfortable with bootstrap to make a project look good so that I didn't have to look at an eyesore while building it. More importantly, I set out to become comfortable with one-to-many and many-to-many relationships and how to create a database and Rails structure to support them.

I found styling to be an incessant time-suck. I learned a lot about the asset pipeline and how to properly use bootstrap and custom CSS in order to make a site look like I want. By the end of it I felt very comfortable maneuvering bootstrap in Rails. I also got comfortable with one-to-many relationships and many-to-many relationships by building out my users-to-climbing-routes model. I didn't get around to finishing the favorites functionality, but that is the first thing I fix when I get back to this project. Overall, this is where things really started to click for me. 

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Mcents/little_shop)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

* Our little shop project is called GearUpp. GearUpp is a shopping app that aims to sell consumer electronics and tech gear at competitive prices, using advanced Rails technology to offer the ultimate customer experience.

* My goal this project was to be knowledgeable enough to be a source of help to others during the project, as I wanted an opportunity to try to teach concepts to test my understanding of them. I found that I was still struggling with ActiveRecord queries, so I will be focusing on those moving forward. Other that that I got more experience building a shopping cart, which solidified my understanding of sessions. I also focused on using Best Buy's API to seed our database with real-world products.

* I have mixed feelings about this project. I feel like there were many opportunities to practice different facets of a Rails application. Our approach as a group was to delegate responsibilities based on lack of experience. If someone felt weak in an area they were free to take on that part of the project to get better. As a result, progress was fairly slow, which is to be expected. 
  * The part that I found a bit frustrating was that there were times when team members wouldn't communicate their struggles about a section they were working on, and something that we expected to take an afternoon took over two days. Looking back, I see this as an opportunity to try to push a group to communicate more clearly about the progress they are making, and in the future I think a better approach would be to group a team member strong in a given area with another team member who is weak in that area. That way learning happens two ways, where one team member is able to ask questions of the other, and the stronger member is able to enforce their knowledge by having to explain it. 
  * Overall I am walking away from this project feeling good about what I have learned abour Rails and team dynamics.

## C: Final Assessments

I felt like I did well at the timed assessment, I completed the stories with time to spare and went back to improve my tests. I did get hung up trying to refactor the average salaries method from ruby to activerecord, but couldn't find a solution in time. This is my greatest weakness right now. I felt like the written test went well too, I made a few mistakes but nothing fundamental and I think I understood all the concepts that were being tested.

It's hard to do a timed assessment and call it my best work. I'm proud of what I accomplished in the given time, but I would absolutely refactor some things given the opportunity.

-----------------------

## D: Module Outcomes

The pace of this module kind of caught me off-guard. I felt like the tutorials were going well until I had to reiterate the information I learned, which made me realized I wasn't picking things up as quickly as I thought. However, by the time the rails mini-project came along I was beginning to have solid understanding of the concepts, and now I feel like I have a very good grasp on what we've learned this mod.
