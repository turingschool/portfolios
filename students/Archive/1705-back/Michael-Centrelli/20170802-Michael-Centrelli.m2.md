## A: Personal Growth
## Areas of Emphasis
I set out this module to bolster my programming habits as well as develope several new ones. Ruby on rails felt like the big focus for this mod, so I hoped that by the end of the module I would feel very comfortable in that enviroment. Another focus of mine going into this module was HTML and css. I wanted to become proficient in front-end styling to compliment the back-end rails work. 

## Areas of Growth
I think the thing I struggled with most this module was the more complex active record queries. When we first learned them I didn't take to their concepts as quick as I would have liked. I felt shaky on them going into little-shop, but used that project as an oppertunity to increase my understanding. 

I think my biggest growth area this module was TDD. At the end of Mod 1 I wasnt totally comfortable writing my programs with pure TDD. I relied a fair bit on dream development and on my knowledge of where I should look next. This module I made it a priority to follow TDD conventions. And now I feel very comfortable building a test first and following my errors and allowing those errors to take me to the solutions. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Bike Share
Repo URL: (https://github.com/JF-Lalonde/bike-share)
Assignment: (https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

**Description:** In this project you'll use Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco. This application will collect data in two ways: 1) through web forms allowing users to enter trip/station/weather information, and 2) by consuming CSV files with historical information for stations, trips, and weather. In addition to creating and storing this information for viewing at a later date, this application will provide a number of user dashboards with higher level analysis of trends in bike share usage.

**Goal/Role:** My goal for this project was to really solidify my ability to CRUD out tables through TDD and to learn more about css and HTML through practice. Unfortunatly, I didn't take on a lot of the active record methods for this project so I felt a bit behind on that. After we worked thorugh the beginning stages of the project and fully crudded out our tables I took on the role of front-end dev. I decided to use pure css/html instead of bootstrap and spent most of the project styling our views. 

**Reflection:** I thought that the project overall went pretty well. Around the middle of the project we felt really good about hitting our goals before the end of the project but I think it got away from us a little bit. We ended up with a lot less tests than we would have liked. A lot of work was done without TDD, which caught up to us in the end. I did end up feeling really good about HTML and css after this project as well as CRUD. 

### Rails Mini Project
Repo URL: (https://github.com/Mcents/Book-Share)
Assignment: (http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

**Description:** This project is called Book-Share. It is a platform for a community to post and share books with others in the community.

**Goal/Role:** My goal for this project was to put everything that we have been learning and churn out a complete web application. I also wanted to create something that people could and might want to actually use. 

**Reflection:** I thought that the project went really well and I was quite happy with the end product. Something that I was really excited about was using slack integration to notify a book owner that another person would like to borrow. I also utilized a book cover api for adding books to the site. Those were two etensions that I was really curious about diving into and they ended up being really interesting to tackle. This was probably the first project that I felt really great about. 

### Little Shop
Repo URL: (https://github.com/Mcents/little_shop)
Assignment: (http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

**Description:** Using Ruby on rails, we build a full functional e-commerce site. 

**Goal/Role:** I think my biggest goal for this project was to become completely comfortable building out a shopping cart and beingable to carry those contents into an order. Another was to build my udnerstanding of admins and how we scope privledges between different users. One of my roles was to build out the admin stories and that helped a lot in building my understanding. 

**Reflection:** This project went really well for me and I think for our group as a whole. I think everyone clicked and worked well together. We were able to come together and pair off for certain things and then split for remote work with no issues. Everyone took on similiar amounts of work and really worked hard to make sure we met our goals. I feel proud of the finished product and will feel confident showing the project to others. 

## C: Final Assessments

I felt that I did okay on the timed assessment. I say that because early on I made two mistakes which really cut my time short. First I created a test for creating a tag which I didn't need to do. It wasnt until after I had the test working that I realized this. The second mistake was not realizing that I didn't have the shoulda-matches gem. I probably should have written my model tests with RSpec instead. I think after those mistakes I did some good work. I think had I had more time I would hve gotten the last method for average salary. I was just about there using active record before time ended. Overall I was dissapointed with my early mistakes but felt good enough about the challenge that I could finish with the time I had lost. And I did go back and get the last method after time had ended. 

I felt pretty good about the written assessment. I found that I knew pretty much every answer and felt like I could explain it well enough. I did mix up two of the verbs on my routes which I realized after I had handed it in. Overall I came out of the test feeling good about what I got out of this mod.
