# Michael Centrelli - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out this module to learn the fundamentals of ruby style and syntax. I wanted to feel comfortable in ruby and be ready to move on to the next module with that foundation under me.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I thought that my individual projects and work went well this module. I felt comfortable tackling challenges on my own, and was able to seek help from others if I wasn't. There was a clear difference from jungle beats to battleship in terms of indiviudal knowledge which helped me track my progress. I found battleship to be incredibly challenging, but also rewarding. Working through that project helped me understand a lot better the breaking down of logic. 

#### (Jungle Beats)

* https://github.com/Mcents/jungle_beats
* http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat

Description: Build a basic drum machine using a linked list.

Comments: Working through iteration 6,
A couple of the methods' return value is off i.e. array instead of string,
Methods/Classes look clean,
19 test, 1 failing.

1: Fundamental Ruby & Style

3. Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

2: Looping or Recursion

3. Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

3: Test-Driven Development

3. Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

4: Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3. Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

5: Functional Expectations

3. Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

#### (Battleship)

* https://github.com/Mcents/Battle_ship
* http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship

Description: Create the classic game Battleship. 

Comments: 2 5 2 13 tests Included some sad path testing 2 failure Uses multiple classes to break apart functionality. Has a number of long methods - talked about chances to refactor.
A fair amount of .each, but also using .map and .all?

1: Fundamental Ruby & Style

2. Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

2: Enumerable & Collections

3. Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

3: Test-Driven Development

2. Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

4: Git Workflow

PASS. Developer demonstrates mastery of git and GitHub; commits with appropriate frequency, with clear, atomic commits that demonstrates a clear history.

4: REPL Interface

3. Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

5: Breaking Logic into Components

3. Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

6: Functional Expectations

3. Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Overall I think that the group projects this module went well. Having another person to work through problems and conceptualize ideas was a huge asset. It also allowed me to get to know some of my classmates better as people. 

#### (Night Writer)

* https://github.com/Mcents/Night_Writer
* http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer

Description: Implement systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse.

Comments: Limited night read tests.
Practice the pattern of methods sending and receiving messages to each other rather than modifying a single instance variable.
All code files should go in the lib directory
Alphabet class needs some tests - all classes should have a test file, all methods should have at least one test.
Application fully functional - minor bug where output text counts line breaks.

1: Fundamental Ruby & Style

3. Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

2: Test-Driven Development

2. Application makes use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

3: Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3. Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

4: Functional Expectations

3. Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

## D: Professional Skills
I found the gear ups to be really informative and thought provoking. Its clear that Turing is commited to not only focusing on the code, but also on the person. It is one of the reasons I wanted to come here. 

### Gear Up
#### (Growth Mindset)

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown

I thought this gear up was really important especially for our first one. I think that falling into a fixed mindset is a common occurance, and can really hinder your ability to learn. This session covered how we can avoid the fixed mindset and instead set ourselves up to always fall into an open one. I am still thinking about things we learned in that session and I believe it has helped me tremendously this mod. 

#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md

This session was interesting. I think that it applies really well to students at Turing and can be extremely helpful as we continue to face tough challenges here. What came out of it for me was that you sort of need to embrace that these things are difficult. Own up to that. Do not let hopelessness drag you down. The harder the thing is to learn, the better it is going to feel when you do.

#### (Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!)

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md

I thought this session was also really appliciable to us as students. Especially with the paired projects where you can have two partners with compeletely different personalities and ways of working. It really helps to be able to know how your partner may work best.  

#### (Personal Story)

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown

In order to know where you are going, you have to know where you are coming from. It was really nice to think about again, why we came to Turing and essentially how we got here. It helped to put things in perspective and solidify the reasons for coming here. It was also good to think about how others percieve you compared to how you want them to. Overall really helpful.

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md

I enjoyed the video in this session. I thought that it brought a lot of light to the issue, and was nice that is was focused on the tech world in general. It really makes you think about your own expierences and how they were similiar or different. And then to look at the issue in terms of the Turing community. It is something that needs to be worked on in the small scale as well as the large. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I spent a decent amount of time working with my Turing mentor. He was extremely helpful on a number of projects. Not just providing answers, but working with me so I lead myself there. He is a connection that I hope to keep outside of Turing. 

I also provided a fair bit of comic relief for the class especially during tough project times. And I spent time trying to gather students for outside activities like going to the bar, and spending lunches outside. I went to a number of possie meetings to try and see what I might like. The lab and armstrong possi'se were especially interesting and I plan for mod 2, to dive deeper into one of those.

Outside of my required cleaning days, I helped to clean the kitchen many times late at night. The Turing community is amazing and I hope that moving forward I can spend more of my time integrating with it. I would love to help with recruitment or something of that sort.
