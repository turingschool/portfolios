## B: Group Work & Projects

  ** Rales Engine
  * Link: https://github.com/samanthagongora/rails_engine
  * Working with Will was great. He is SO positive. I enjoyed working on the Boss Mode, reminded me of some of the mind benders in Mod 1!

  ** Turing Professionals
  * Link: https://github.com/samanthagongora/turing_professionals
  * I enjoyed working on AJAX calls and making some sweet frontend/backend stuffs happen. Overall, this was much more difficult of a project than expected.

  ** Uncorked
  * Link: https://github.com/emcooper/uncorked
  * Again, much harder than expected. I enjoyed working with a complicated code base, even if it were infuriating at times. I wish we had more time to refactor most of the project.
