# Samantha Gongora - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Having beginner experience in Ruby, I set out to learn as much as possible about test driven development, business tools (git, github, slack, etc.), pair-programming, and debugging. Starting out in mod 1, testing was painful. I have noticed a significant reduction in pain while testing in my current work. I would venture to say it's becoming enjoyable. I strongly believe the skills I have learned related to pair-programming and debugging will be invaluable during my career at Turing and elsewhere. Looking back on where I was 6 weeks ago, I am proud of how much I have learned and the effort I have put into the program.  

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 4
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I think that I learned the most, technically, from my individual work. Fundamental gaps were more apparent and questions about how to improve came more easily. Through independent work, I became more comfortable asking questions.

description:
   * I built a binary search tree that stored a group of movie titles by score. I did not finish this project. I had a slew of issues happen on my last work day, and learned a few life lessons. I had never built a program this large, and it was apparent in the organization of my project. I learned how to use recursion, nodes, complex data structures, and multiple classes.

evaluation comments:
   * 25 tests, all passing
   * completed up to min
   * good recursive approach
   * very thorough testing

evaluation scores:
1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
   * 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
2. Test-Driven Development
   * 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
   * 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Functional Expectations
   * 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/samanthagongora/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module1/projects/battleship.markdown)

description:
   * I built a very basic REPL interface Battleship game. Again, I had never worked on a project of this size. I had the most issues with deciding how to break-up and tackle the project. I disagree with my grade on Enumerable & Collections, but overall satisfied with my scores. This is a project I would like to come back to in the future.

evaluation comments:
   * Very well tested
   * Only single board class which is awesome, written super good.
   * Some small opportunities to refactor, check your indentations as a guide to where to pull out new methods.

evaluation scores:
1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
   * 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
2. Enumerable & Collections
   * 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques
3. Test-Driven Development
   * 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
4. Git Workflow
   * FAIL: Developer does not commit often, commits are overly large, poor commit messages. Drastic changes in code in a single commit.
4. REPL Interface
   * 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use
5. Breaking Logic into Components
   * 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components such that individual pieces could be reused or replaced without difficulty
6. Functional Expectations
   * 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I very much enjoyed working on pair projects. Teaching yourself to code, pairing is not something you get to do often. I learned the most about collaboration and increased capability when you put minds together. I put in the most hours when working with a partner, but still enjoyed the process.

#### (Complete Me)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emcooper/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module1/projects/complete_me.markdown)

description:
   * Ellen and I created a trie to store words in the dictionary by their letter. This project was one of the easiest for me. Having completed the binary search tree the week before, this project seemed only slightly more complex. We were able to finish the project early and work on an extension. We used Shoes to make a GUI for our project. Shoes was a terrible mess, but it was really awesome to see our program in action!

evaluation comments: none

evaluation scores:
1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
   * 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
2. Test-Driven Development
   * 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
   * 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
4. Functional Expectations
   * 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

#### (Black Thursday)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mdevoe12/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module1/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

description:
   * Matt and I developed an ORM from the ground up. We were capable of breaking the project into small pieces and tackle chunks at a time. We paired for almost the entire project, and I think it was a huge part of our success.

evaluation scores:
1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
   * 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
2. Breaking Logic into Components
   * 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
3. Test-Driven Development
   * 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
4. Functional Expectations
   * 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5
5. Code Sanitation
   * 4: Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills
I came to Turing hoping to improve my skills in leadership and project management. I considered myself capable of managing stress and a strong communicator. I have far exceeded my expectations in my growth to better manage stress and communicate. I have throughly enjoyed connecting with the Turing community and am looking forward to a career of strong human connections! My work on SAB has taught me more about community engagement and effective listening. I am pleased with how far I have come in 6 weeks!

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

I thought the growth mindset gear up was well timed and thoughtfully presented. I can be rather hard on myself to achieve my goals. I think that knowing about growth mindset has given me tools to take a step back in times of stress. I would like to say I am always kind to myself and I have no problems thinking I can't do certain things. As is life, a growth mindset is a meditation.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

Getting better at difficult things affirmed some thoughts I had about our mind's capability to do many things. I have limited my goals to a few manageable tasks while at Turing. Having priorities, checklists, and a routine have helped increase my focus on what I deem important.

####Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

This was my least favorite gear up. While I enjoyed talking to everyone, I think it could have benefited from some work-style examples. Mostly my group talked about how everyone needs alone time and the differences we faced when meeting people. Even though I tend to be an introvert, I enjoy group work and collaboration.

####Personal Stories & Connection

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

I enjoyed talking to many different people and hearing about how they came to Turing. The common thread seems to be that we were all looking for something different. Often times, something more challenging than our last career. It was awesome to see all the passion and drive in the room! I think I have more to develop about my story, and look forward to working on it throughout my time here.

####Debugging the Gender Gap & Microaggressions in Tech

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

Our cohort is not very diverse. I think that this gear up had the possibility of going very poorly and even alienating the minority team members in the room. I definitely catch myself wondering if I am going into the right field. Discrimination is something that some have to deal with on a daily basis. Do I really want to join a field known for its struggle to accept minority members? Yes. The way our cohort handled the topic gives me hope about the future of tech.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During Module 1, I served as a Student Advisory Board (SAB) Representative. I attended all Thursday SAB meetings and co-lead Friday retros. Feedback received from retros were brought up during SAB meetings to solicit suggestions for improving culture. A few suggestions Jim and I were able to incorporate:
   * Talking about curriculum concerns to recognize commonality among cohort members, but also encourage survey feedback
   * Mention at least one positive thing for the week, related to anything
   * Implementing shout-out opportunities for behavior we want to celebrate
