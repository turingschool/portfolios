# Samantha Gongora - M2 Portfolio
-----------------------

## A: Personal Growth

## Areas of Emphasis

  * Git Workflow
  * Pair programming in conjunction with working remotely
  * Building visual representations of data
  * Digging deeper into best practices
  * Asking Mike more questions during evaluations/check-ins

## Areas of Growth

  * What did you struggle with most this module?
    * I struggled the most with testing in Rspec and using Capybara. I often didn't know how to find certain fields, or the second identical button on a page. Things are getting better though, and so are my tests!

  * What areas did you grow in most this module?
    * I was able to get much more comfortable with Git. I am comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. This allowed me to spend much more time remote, which cut down on the time I spent commuting from Boulder.

    * I made a point to formulate and write down questions before project check-ins. This helped me have more effective meetings and polished code.

    * After the Battleship project in Module 1, I was very excited to build applications that users could interact with. I had the most fun with the analytical dashboards!

-----------------------

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Some crazy things happened, project-wise, in mod 2. From building a *real* application in our first group project, to breathing life to a personal concept, and finally creating a shop with authentication, authorization, and sessions! Dive into my journey:

#### Bike-Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bretfunk/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

Description:
  * Use Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco. Collect data in two ways: 1) through web forms, and 2) by consuming CSV files. Provide a number of user dashboards with higher level analysis of trends in bike share usage.

Goals:
  * Get comfortable with Bootstrap
  * Learn more about ActiveRecord associations and requests

Role:
  * We didn't have a project manager, but I often brought the group together for retros to talk about accomplishments and bugs.
  * I worked with Bret a great deal on styling and worked on the weather CRUD functionality to get more familiar with database associations.

Reflection:
  * I remember feeling on day 2 like I did not yet have all the knowledge to complete the project. I also remember feeling very calm about this realization. I knew that I was going to learn a great deal about bootstrap and database relations. I walked away feeling accomplished and excited about the rest of the module.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/samanthagongora/meal-planner)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

Description:
  * Create and deploy a functioning app to Heroku. Implement authentication/authorization, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. Style your project do it isn't horrible to use.

Goals:
  * To build a meal planning app that could compile a shopping list for a weeks worth of meals. Stretch goal to add a recipe API with nutrition information.

Reflection:
  * I did not get nearly as far as I had hoped. I learned about form objects, trade-offs in persisting data to a database, and implementing agile practices in a personal project. I believe this is the evaluation where I was most prepared with questions and got the most out of my feedback. I felt great about the things I learned, and eager to increase productivity.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thedanielvogelsang/little_shop)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

Description:
  * Use Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering. Use TDD to drive all layers of development. Design a system of models which use one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. Practice styling with HTML, CSS, and templates. Practice agile workflow and deploy to Heroku.

Goals:
  * I set out to improve my ActiveRecord skills.

Role:
  * I worked a bit on styling, ending a user session, retiring items, admin namespacing, admin orders viewing, and changing order status.

Reflection:
  * I felt well prepared for this project. Even when I took stories that were out of my comfort zone, I was surprised by how quickly I met the spec. I can tell my googling instincts are getting better, I am asking for opinions earlier, and  I am making connections between lessons and projects.

-----------------------

## C: Final Assessments
  * How did you do on written and timed independent?
    * I think I did very well on the code and written assessments. I struggled more that I would have liked on the average salary method on the code assessment. I wanted to spend more time refactoring and testing the models. I remembered a lot more than I expected on the written portion. I felt the repetition throughout the mod significantly prepared me.

  * Was this a representation of your best work?
    * Yes!

-----------------------

## D: Module Outcomes
  * Interacting with something that you created is very satisfying! I enjoy the challenge of routing, working with views, and creating/maintaining databases. I think I might be employable at the end of this thing!
