# DANIEL VOGELSANG -- (M3) PORTFOLIO

##Areas of Emphasis

<What did you set out to accomplish this module?>
I wanted to become much more confident in my coding skills, and I think I've done that.

<Takeaways, your experience>
I think that my major take homes are (a) the importance of reaching out and asking for help. Despite my historic tendency to prefer masochistically beating my head against the wall until anger subsumes me, I began to recognize that I often was actually hindering my growth by 'going it alone', and that in coding you can sometimes spend many hours wasted grooming code for simple error fixes that dont necessarily advance your cause; (b) that teaching and talking about code (predictably) makes me understand it better, so working with a partner and thinking through projects is a good way to build comeraderie in the team; (c) I finally feel ready to tackle the job market.

###A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

APIcurious
http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious

<Description>
consuming public databases via api calls

<Takeaways, your experience>
I loved the early projects of the mod, particularly those pertaining to endpoints and manipulating the return data. I feel very confident in my skills with API calls and PORO-creation, and am thankful for my dedication to redoing this project (API CURIOUS) over and over until i could mostly do it from memory. Figaro, Faraday, and api endpoints themselves were all new at this stage, so mastering them required learning about several new topics.

###B: Group Work & Projects

####Rales Engine
http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine

<Description>
Largely focused on ActiveRecord/SQL data-manipulation and B.I., this project was a reiteration of MOD1 project "SALES ENGINE", and was a joy. This project required us creating and making calls to a local api that was returning JSON objects representing local database records relating to a fictional business with a large CSV-supplied database.

<Takeaways, your experience>
Cruising through a former project with much more clarity and direction and mastery of the ruby-end, was really fun. I really enjoyed the professionality of my partner, and working together on the ActiveRecord problems felt like brain-games. My only disappointment is that today, 6 weeks later, my SQL/ActiveRecord knowledge has faded a ton. Definitely need to include that into my Mod-4-job-prep.

####Cloney Island Cloney Island Sprint 1
https://github.com/mdevoe12/youth_sports

<Description>
This was a two-week green-field project that required fast-paced app-creation based on intercommunication with a 'client' or 'owner' (our professor), who in turn gave / approved user stories. We were graded in part on the completion of group user-story requirements, but mostly off the completion of our own major side-feature, which was chosen together in a preliminary student-teacher conversation. Our app attempted to build a platform for League coaches/teams to show off middle and elementary- school basketball stats from local club teams. My side-feature pertained to populating a profile chart with database points/fouls data, via a jquery/ajax call.

<Takeaways, your experience>
This was a frustrating but rewarding project, where I think I really took a deep-dive into self-educated programming. The charts.js / jquery use was brand new, highly confusing, and took me all of several days. However the process was worth it. I feel much more confident in not only ajax, but more importantly in my methodology/approach when tough, new problems arise on the job scene.

On a side note, my biggest take-away from this project was the importance of team-communication, particularly and especially when its evident that not everyone was on the same page. I think, looking back, that choice conversations and perhaps more intentional explanation would have resulted in smoother app-formation. This project underscored the value of working on my own communcation skills within a group setting.

####Cloney Island Sprint 2
https://github.com/JF-Lalonde/cloney_island_airbnb/tree/master

<Description>
In this second two week spring, a new collaboration of students inherited a brown-field project from previous MODs to work on and improve. We were graded on the completion of our user-stories, as well as the overall quality of the app / user-experience. Our group inherited an ActiveRecord/Rails project that emulated AirBnb.com, and we tackled converting the entire app into airbnb-api populated listings, created a messaging system, double-authorization via Twilio, and a dynamic MapBox ajax calls to populate a listings map based on search location.

<Takeaways, your experience>
This was a very rewarding project, I felt good about my place in the group; I felt excellent about the quality of work coming from my partners; I felt great about team communication; and I think my skills are growing. The bigger picture is coming slowly into view.
