# DANIEL VOGELSANG -- (M2) PORTFOLIO

## Evaluation Notes
My first major project was Bike-Share, in which we worked hard and fast and continuously, but didn't make it through all the iterations. This project set a precedent for the remainder of the Mod, and I worked hard to match my focus within all future projects on the spec's explicit requests: in other words, started adopting the mentality of a employee/client relationship--which was fun and rewarding. All subsequent evals have left me feeling very positive and as if I am on the right track. I think that the only major thing I'd like to continue to keep improving is the degree to which I can interact both via SEQUEL and ACTIVERECORD with databases. I know some of my cohort peers have taken on learning sequel in private, and I think I might do that too. Otherwise, I'm feeling very confident in my TDD, my feature tests, and the MVC model.

## Non-evaluated Projects (Rails Mini, Mix-Master)
Mix-Master:
At this stage I was still extremely lost on much of the CRUD syntax and process, and so our first introduction into Rails and all the new syntax that comes with it was probably the peak of my stress during mod 2. Unlike Mod 1, which demanded the more critical-analysis side of my intellect, it seemed to me that Mod2 was about thinking many steps ahead within a process that would only be understood with practice and habit. At the beginning, I felt justifiably overwhelmed, however I think Mix-Master was a resource that I returned to many, many times as we worked through latter projects, as it laid out the basics of Rails well, and allowed a quick and painless way to review associations, the MVC model, and feature tests/model tests, which were all new concepts at the time.

Rails-Mini:
This, after Bike-Share, was my favorite project of the mod. I remember that, prior to the project, my Rails knowledge was slim at best, and that I spent hours and hours that weekend chasing errors and eking forward frustratingly slow, which at the time was very stressful. However now, looking back, I recognize that it was this project -- and the floundering struggle that I engaged in all weekend long -- that most propelled my facility with Rails, Routes, and MVC fluency. The app itself was exciting to me because it was based on my own real-world experience within politics, and thus allowed me to see a direct crossover between what skills I've gained in the last three months and the worlds I hope to effect and work in. I am proud of 'ComreCat' thus far, and I aim to finish more of this app and use it in my portfolio later for employment.

## Evaluated projects: (Little Shop, Bike Share)
Bike-Share:
Despite not quite finishing through all the iterations, Bike-Share was the most memorable and rewarding projects of the mod, other than my Rails-Mini. My group came together and effectively managed work flow even as we all were feeling overwhelmed with juggling all the Git Tools and requirements with the MVC and new erb syntax that we had just learned about. THe project's scope and breadth allowed for all of us to touch on a variety of instances of subject matter, but I spent most of my time developing the CSS, which I really wanted to do. Despite the extreme gains I made when it comes to the front-end side of building apps, my choice to spend most of the project work time on Styling left me with too little knowledge of ActiveRecord, and I subsequently felt pressured for the next two weeks in catching up and steeping myself more in the database side of Rails. I thought group dynamic was strong and effective and our post-project retro embodied that, as everyone was exceedingly kind and complimentary during feedback time.

Since our group retro, I have intentionally reached out and had feedback reflection time with two of the three peers I worked on Bike-Share with. Both Eddie and Des gave me exceedingly kind reviews, and while Eddie had 'nothing negative to say', Des helped me address some of the frictions that have occurred in a later group. We have worked hard, Des and I, at maintaining a friendship despite communication lapses. As time has gone on, we have gotten much better at communicating patiently and with the intention of listening first before responding. She and I also were paired together for our final project, and I would hope that, like me, she would report that things have improved tremendously.

By speaking with both these members, it helped me feel confident in what I bring to the team: skepticism, direction, and strategy; while also cognizant (for the nth time) that my general serious and direct demeanor is intimidating for some.

Little-Shop
Almost the reverse experience of Bike-Share, I felt on top of my game the entire project, and felt that the iterations were in many ways much easier than most of the projects we've seen up until now. Divided between 4, iterations were pieced together in a way that felt very much like I would image the real work environment will be like, and the Agile approach was on full display. It was actually quite extraordinary to consider how rapidly we moved through the project, given where we were a mere few weeks ago. I felt very good about my ability to meet all the demands of the project. However despite feeling like this project underscored my 'mastery' of the curriculum thus far, group dynamics made for a stressful environment. By the end, our group had adopted mostly a workflow that allowed us to mostly work remotely and avoid personality issues. The project was a big learning opportunity for me, and I look forward to dissecting it more in time.

## Assessments: Final
I felt exceedingly good about my performance Finals week. Unlike Mod1, which felt like a mad-dash to the end, my small group for Little Shop evenly and efficiently distributed the work load so that, quite honestly, i was even to take some free time and socialize a couple times this week. I think I've grasped the most important concepts this mod, and feel excited to see whats next!

## Community:
I think its in the Gear-UP discussions that I've seen my role as a fellow Turing student most blossom. I feel at home in the realms of self-analysis, emotional/psychological discussion, and vulnerability. I think this mod, I found myself being a leader in my gear-ups both as a unifier of message and MC for the discussions themselves, and as someone who encourages new thoughts and healthy conflict within most all my sessions. I hope that those folks in and outside my cohort with whom I've interacted would promote me as someone who provokes not only deep conversation, but as a thoughtful group member that also knows how to listen. I really enjoyed the Gear-Ups this mod.
