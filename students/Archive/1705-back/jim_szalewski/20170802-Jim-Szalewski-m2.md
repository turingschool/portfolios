## A: Personal Growth

## Areas of Emphasis

On a technical level, I was hoping to come out of this mod with not only a working knowledge of the content, but confidence in that knowledge. I was a little intimidated by HTML and CSS at first, and wanted to overcome that fear and gain a solid understanding of styling concepts, which I think I succeeded at.

## Areas of Growth

The main thing I struggled with this mod was decyphering error messages that came from gems or versions. After I had a talk with an instructor, it realigned my perspective. Now I see every little hurdle as part of the greater struggle of learning how to code. I think this led to my greatest area of growth. I started to see every problem as part of learning to code, instead of my earlier expectations of being able to do it "plug and play" style. Gaining understanding of gems and dependecies has made me so much more confident in my ability to solve problems.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Starting off and ending the mod with group projects set the tone for this mod. I feel like it helped me to be more accountable, and I feel like I carried a lot of those good habits into my personal projects.

#### Bike-Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JoelLindow/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

A group project using Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord. This application collected data in two ways; allowing users to submit info through forms and through parsing CSV files. Group for this project was Joel Lindow, Ellen Cooper(PM), and Jimmy Truong.

My goal for this project was to learn as much as possible about Active Record associations and the use of RSpec. My role was mainly testing for this project, and I fell in love with RSpec (had to let Minitest down easy). I didn't just write tests though, I was implemented the CRUD functionality of the trips table.

I really liked our group. Ellen was an amazing project manager, keeping everything organized and keeping everyone accountable in a tactful and professional way. I feel like this project set me up for mod 2 success through the repetition involved in implementing the complex relationships between tables. I also really enjoyed being able to get my hands deep into RSpec, and learn how to test drive rails app development.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jimszalew/mini-project)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

A choose your own adventure Rails application. I went with what I know, restaurants. I set out to design an app that was barely anything real world useful, but it evolved into something that could actually have real world application. The design is a platform on which restaurants and their sales reps could have a central location for placing orders and keeping track of items, prices, and inventory.

I saw this project as an opportunity to see if I could create an entire rails app on my own, as well as put some of myself into the project. I was also hoping to have something to continue working on even after it was turned in and given feedback.

I wasn't able to get as far as I would have liked in the time alotted this project. However this is something I have the utmost faith in being real world applicable. This was the first time I was able to choose the style and direction of a project and put my heart into. I learned a lot about user authentication and authorization, creating different user types and giving different users different privileges. I look forward to continuing work on this app.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/swdonovan/scoots_shop)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

Scoot Shop. Group: Mikel Sagapolutele (PM), Daniel Phillips, Wil Donovan.
In this project we created an online ordering platform for scooters where customers can browse scooters and place orders. Admins on the page can manage scooters and categories, as well as processing orders.

Dan, Wil, and I were all pretty much equal as far as roles. We would get together and decide who would take which waffle card. We switched off on the more intense user stories and also employed a ping pong style of development on one part, where one of us wrote a test and passed it to the other to make it pass.

I feel like we all had an equal share in the learning opportunities on this project. It felt good to push myself to implement the paperclip gem (even though the instructions on thoughtbot's github page are fairly clear) and to push myself in general. So far I have been intimidated to try to do anything I perceived as extra, but throughout the course of the mod I've come to realize that self motivation is key to learning as much as possible. The finished product is something that I am proud to show off to friends, and I look forward to increasing my learning.

## C: Final Assessments

### Final Independent Assessment

#### 1. Workflow

* **2: Developer reached a solution, but process was not logical or process was not broken into small steps**

#### 2. Feature Completeness

* **4: Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests**

#### 3. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style

* **3: Developer mostly establishes and utilizes ActiveRecord methods for effective results**

#### 4. Rails Style / MVC

* **4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and establish logic in the appropriate classes**

#### 5. Testing

* **3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may have trouble parsing errors or prioritizing next steps**

I feel as though this is close to representative of my best work. I am usually obsessive about my commits, so it doesn't sit well that my worst score was in workflow. I pushed through the nervousness that clouded my thinking in the first 45 minutes, and found my stride. I made some illogical choices at first, but once I figured out

### Final Written Assessment

#### Comprehension

*   **3: Developer demonstrates sufficient comprehension of most critical concepts covered**

#### Technical Communication

*   **3: Developerâ€™s responses are mostly clear and complete**

I feel like this is definitely representative of my best work. Given time and practice I will have these concepts down like second nature.

## D: Module Outcomes

I feel so much better about this mod than last. I feel so much more confident in my growing abilities, more patience with not knowing exactly what I'm doing, and way less stress about the failures and the struggles. I'm not going to lull myself into a false sense of confidence, on the contrary this mod has served as a lesson to me that the more I push myself the more I'm going to learn.
