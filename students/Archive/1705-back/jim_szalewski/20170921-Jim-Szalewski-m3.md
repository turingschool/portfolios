#### **Posse**
  >* The armstrong posse was pretty open and free form. We used it as a time to help each other with code or just chat and help each other destress.

#### **Playing a Part**

>* I was the leader of the Armstrong posse this mod and tried to set up meetings with mentors, one of which was actually successful.
