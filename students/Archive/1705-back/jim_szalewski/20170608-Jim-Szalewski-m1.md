# Jim Szalewski - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming from a place of absolutely zero programming knowledge, I knew I had my work cut out for me. I didn't know exactly what to expect but I came into this first module wanting to become proficient in a new language. I fully accepted that I wasn't going to have all of the Ruby answers, but I knew it would be fully within my grasp to be able to know where to look for answers. I've worked toward being able to ask the right questions to point me in the right direction, and I've put in a significant amount of work on making sure I understand ruby functionality on a conceptual basis, so even if I'm not sure what code to write, I know what I want the program to do and I know enough of the code to get me there.

Methods are trim
Some extra variable assignment - redundant 9 tests, 5 passing

(evaluation scores)
1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  + 2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

2. Test-Driven Development
  + 2: Application makes use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  + 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jimszalew/black_thursday)

(evaluation comments)
  + Notes:
    - Said "Really well"
    - Done through iteration 4
    - Simplecov at 99.4 34.7523s to run their test suite
    - 382 assertions 194 tests
    - any, reduce, map, find, find_all
    - Test Challenges: Fixtures difficult to align with needs
    - Test Success: Broad scope, helped with ability to trace data
    - Ruby & Style: Items as a hash - position wasn't going to matter, hash to array easier than array to hash, saves iteration on some of the find methods
    - Method lengths are great, talked through how to refactor some longer methods - long methods aren't even that long
    - Components:
      * Good use classes
      * Spoke to spec being fairly intuitive until Iter 4 - then got confusing what was actually being asked for

(evaluation scores)
1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  + 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

2. Breaking Logic into Components
  + 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

3. Test-Driven Development
  + 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

4. Functional Expectations
  + 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

5. Code Sanitation
  + 4: Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

This gear up has really stuck with me throughout my time in Module 1. It helped me to see certain events and attitudes I've held throughout my life in a different light. For the over a decade my narrative was that I've only ever worked in kitchens and that's all I really can do. I see that now as a fixed mindset. My thought process was what kept me in the same unfulfilling profession, not any sort of lack of skill. The curriculum at Turing has almost demanded a constant growth mindset. I've noticed that the times I've done poorly have been due, again, to my thought process. I've totally psyched myself out with thoughts like "I'll never get through this project", when I now know I have the skills necessary.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

This session reinforced concepts from the first gear up. It helped to point out the peaks and valleys of learning a new difficult thing. There's a rush of amazing feelings when you notice you consistently get something right. Unfortunately those dizzying highs help make the despair ridden lows feel that much more intense. Swinging between feeling smart/capable and helpless is a terrible feeling, but it is just that; a feeling. Feelings will come and go as we attempt to learn difficult things, and throughout life in general. If you spend too much energy on those feelings, it won't leave energy for much else, let alone learning a programming language.

#### Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

I would say I was most surprised with my take away from this gear up. I always thought myself to be somewhat of an extrovert, but introvert and extrovert aren't as simple as outgoing and shy as I previously thought. The concept of where one derives one's energy from as the deciding factor between introvert and extrovert was very interesting. Introverts don't inherently not like being around people, they just may need a little more alone time, or time to analyze things. So even thought I like to be around other people, I still need to walk around in my own head for a bit from time to time, leading me to believe that I'm more of an introvert than I realized.

#### Personal Stories & Connection

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

In this gear up, we had the opportunity to discuss life stories with other people from our cohort and 1705 front end. Hearing about the many different walks of life people came from was fascinating and inspiring. The reflections focused on the lenses through which we view the world, which was a great exercise in identifying my potential blind spots when it comes to my everyday interactions with other people. It really made me think about what other people may be going through in any given moment that would drive their actions. It helped me to take a more considerate approach to how I interact with people.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap & Microaggressions in Tech

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

I really enjoyed this particular session. It was very informative being in a discussion group with two women. I frequently think about ways that I might make any given environment feel unsafe just by being thoughtless with my actions or words. Hearing about the professional experiences of two of my female cohort mates brought to light things that I might not have ever realized on my own. My reactions to the testimonials of women in the video ranged from "yeah, I've seen that" to "oh no, I've done that" to "wow, I had no idea that happens". I'm grateful for this exercise and the culture of Turing, which help in propelling my interest in social justice issues.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I always did my best to try and help fellow students if they had a problem, even if I didn't quite have the answer myself. I feel as though collaboration is this sneaky hidden method of learning. I never realized it at the time, but after every collaboration with another student, I would realize new things that I didn't know before, or I would notice my understanding of the subject of the collaboration had grown. I hope, and like to think, that the people I collaborated with can say the same. Module 1 seemed very overwhelming, so I didn't feel like I could handle being in a posse, even though the socially conscious nature of the Pahlka posse has my interest piqued. I will definitely be looking into a posse in Mod 2. That said I feel as though my time on SAB was helpful in connecting me with the students in my cohort and the Turing community at large. I look forward to SAB next Mod and to checking out what some posses have to offer now that I am more acclimated to a skill set that, prior to 6 weeks ago, I didn't have a trace of.
