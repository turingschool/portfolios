## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?
Pass and get a job.  Make JS a instinctive language. Find the driving passion for creativing and code that I had in Mod 1 and Mod 2. 

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
Pass- my belief. But subjectively graded @ Fail.

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  The API endpoint was not working properly and the documentation wasn't the greatest I have worked.  The Assessment scope was quite vague.
  
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  Seeing the assessment scope.  Time challenge of the assessment.  The TCA is a good interview prep session, but the questions asked were not expected from the description of the assessment.
  
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  Broke it down quickly and used the 4 weeks of JS knowledge I possessed and completed it.
  
* What did you learn?
  Documentation is so important.

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  Doing the whole node API by myself.  Possessing little knowledge of file structure and still finding resources to get the project ahead of schedule while I was working alone for the first week.
  
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  Found resources and got the job done.
  
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  Not being graded or counted.
  
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  JS file organization,  Team member expectation, work load responsibility and neglect.
  
* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
   It taught a great amount and inflicted more harm physically and mentally than any other project.
   
## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  Coming up with an idea that was small scaled enough to suffice for Techies but large enough in scope to show value beyone Tech for my personal passion.
  Give a week to complete with massive amounts of leadership disruptions made this extremely difficult with out much project scope direction.
  
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  Talked with peers. Found interesting answers.  Reached out and did the required standups.
  
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  The result of the project.
  
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  8 different new peices of technology and deploying to new hosting sites was MASSIVE in building my knowledge and problem sovling skill. I am utterly glad I did each one and wish I could have integrated it with Rails to REALLY show what i had learned in 7 months.  
  
## Feedback

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
 Paired and supported/helped peers
## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
RAILS JS, a massively better understanding of how important cultures are to each and every company.  How incredibly important culture is to a companies future, potential, and longevity.
The massive importance on leadership and how it needs to be used effectively.
The incredible importance of Big Picture thinking, thinking outside of the box, and foresight are and how easily it is lost.
