## A: Personal Growth

## Areas of Emphasis

I honestly set out to quite a variety of things.  All ranging from success to failure.  I first and foremost didn't want to be overwhelmed and confused/lost when it came to what we were learning / being taught.  I wanted to be able to absorb and retain and find a way to effectively and efficiently use it and not have to grind out the learning process.  This was equally as successful and it was a failure.  I partially achieved what I wanted and was able to reserve cognitive resources but I get left with a feeling to push myself harder in finding ways to learn and learn quicker or a sense of complacency will set in.  There was a student led spike on this in the first or second week of this Mod by some mod 4 students and this will continue to pay huge dividends.

I also set out to better utilize my strengths instead of shying away from them to be a better leader for the group. Not in a sense to actually lead, or be super proactive, or be the voice or anything of such, but just be a better person to; ground people out, motivate others, articulate my understandings and help others do that, and just a better sense of big picture logical guidance,  when i knew we would get caught up in the 'smell' of the basement (figure of speech).  This goal was a failure and I failed quite ridiculously to be honest for most of the Mod and actually technically its not a success yet.  The oppurtunties were of plenty some at the start but I allowed the 'smell' to strip me of motivation to be honest and failed to take the initiative I should have early on until crunch time came along for the final project and one conversation with our project lead took a failure and gave it a coating of success.

These were the two biggest goals: Technical top goal and Non-technical Top goal i guess is how I saw it.  

## Areas of Growth

(What did you struggle with most this module?)
  Figuring out the dynamics of group projects.  Coming from a background where 4 people working on something should be more effecient not less effecient was mind numbing and difficult.  The beginning of rails for the first few days was latin and then I saw (or what i perceive to see) the concept of how and why it was created and then it all clicked
(What areas did you grow in most this module?)
  The same area I struggled in the most.  This is habit to do or either over focus.  Ability to understand what we were being taught and applying it quickly was awesome.  Its nothing amazing its just a relief from the struggle of Mod 1.  There was quite a victory during the final project to learning to deal with conflicts.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Bike-Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/katiekeel/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

Bike sharing app to track bikes, weather, trips, and stations.  Great intro project for learning database management, setup, and overall understanding.

Goal was to contribute as much as possible and couldn't quite apply much else due to the unknown dynamics of a 4 person project.  Roles weren't specific other than for the project manager.  

Goals adjusted on a daily basis with this project and it provided various amounts of difficult dynamics, so reflections are difficult outside of technical areas with sinatra and the introduction with active record.  
Non-Tech--This project was a good learning curve to team dynamic, growth, struggles, and the dynamic of trust within a team and leads.  
Tech--Using sinatra was frustrating and learning rails made sinatra even more frustrating but the base/foundational knowledge that it provided to learning rails was invaluable.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/swdonovan/moo_ni_project)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

A self choosing project.  Was having difficulty finding something to motivate me so I used the ranch and the dynamics of its innerworkings with databases and tables and the analytics they provide, to start a project that I could continue after the Mod when my base knowledge was better.  

Get a client side ready version of the application to see if it was worthy of building out and some very base functionality.  After adding a team member and looking at the future ciriculum I errored toward the side of getting a full understanding of CRUD'ing out rails MVC models and in the end 50+ routes and 35+ views I think the base understanding of the rails was achieved and while it is not client side ready by any means, that set back was worth allowing the other team member along with myself the ability to really understand rails.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/swdonovan/scoots_shop)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

  Group project, our choice of what we were selling, online e-commerce ability, real-life application, get it done or theres possible reprucussions.  

Roles again weren't specified. Self assigned role would be to watch over the progress.

## C: Final Assessments

(how did you do on written and timed independent?)
Timed--
All 3's on the Timed -- Best work? No but with pressure that I allow myself to apply to myself on these timed assesments its deserving for the quality of work.  example--I wrote out 2 different average salary methods that were completely useless before I slowed down and logically thought through the simple math and 5 minutes later I created it on another table. Silly-ness, so not best work but for that Yes.  Also I completed tests in a final assessment, thats a personal win.

Written--### Comprehension

   **3: Developer demonstrates sufficient comprehension of most critical concepts covered**

### Technical Communication

   **3: Developer's responses are mostly clear and complete**
I can say that 
(was this a representation of your best work?)
