## Areas of Emphasis

  -- This was a multi-facet approach as my first approach was to build off of Mod-2 as I felt that I retained and understood what was being taught at a much better rate. So I was hoping to keep that going.
  I also wanted to improve team dynamics, building, and leadership.  This was the only thing that I would qiuckly say that wasn't achieved as proficiently as I would of hoped.  I was quickly emerged with realization of how important project managers and organization is to even simplified software programs but twice as important is their leadership abilities in many areas.  This quickly reshaped and refocused my job search criteria quickly, amongst many other areas.  
  Technically I liked this mod as there was multiple times where I would feel completely lost and drowning and had to rely on finding resources (technically proficient?? *google*) to figure it out in much more complex api's or now aws but up until AWS I was able to complete each of them quickly while retaining important knowledge whether it be in JS, or API's, or AJAX (understandably thats JS), or AWS.  Each of them were crucial.  One of the funnest mod's but thats definitely not my brain speaking.

  Notes:
  I barely know what i am talking about so take this with a grain of salt. The last two projects of the Mod are so incredibly valuable. First the grading team members has an accountability factor that I really like.  It might be hated after this mod, that can either be used to create an atmosphere/reputation to emphasize the accountability or do away with to keep the peace, thankfully not my decision but both approaches can't be argued against.

  With just little things that we are exposed to with sprints, and times, and work flows, and groups, ect; the projects do have a lot of excitement built around them. But as soon as it realized that those exciting visions or hopes of directing a project are unobtainable the enthusiasm and drive/push for quality projects is lost.  The cause of this effect is good in a lot of ways, but keeping perspective or pushing for quality projects all around, if its important, could be emphasized in a group grade. The other effect is keeping an innovative mindset to pivot and drive for something thats not as cool but still worth while to the product, maybe to show more than just a desire to learn what is important to each person at that time.

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
**[My-APIcurious](https://github.com/swdonovan/ghub_mini_bro)**
 Project was a cool concept of building a front facing browser that pulled from Git Hub API and built statistics or reports from the api.  
 This project not only was a great introduction to using api's and getting to toy and play with them but it provided certain lessons that I still have epiphanies about as I am working with AWS.



## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
> **[Our Rales Engine](https://github.com/swdonovan/rails_engine)**
Build  A Rails API

This was a good practice round as I got a lot of practice in using serialize and building all the relationship routes which paid much dividend in the final assessment.
 Outside of being taught the importance of simple cov and testing, this was my introduction to much of the organizational side and the realization that no matter how much effort put forth, leadership or feedback is important.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/swdonovan/shelter)**
Build a multi-tenancy site.

This was a fun experience as it built off of the Cloney Island realizations and was finally the motivation to start fully studying the leadership side of software development.  This was my first test of having a great technical team that was lost sometimes doing their own things.
Technically speaking I explored in so many areas and picked up vast amounts of knowledge from experimenting, especially with JS, that it was a good all around project.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://github.com/swdonovan/uncorked)**
Brownfield project.  Clean it up make it client ready and build some cool shit.

This brownfield project has been something I've waited for since the ending of Mod-1.  Picking up big projects and looking them over and understanding what just happened to this thing has always been a curiosity.  The results were indescribably educational both great and not so great, I think that says enough.  My team was great all around and burnt out so piecing together an app with bare bones READ.me, very little large scale usage or direction to go with it, pieces built in place by some one MUCH smarter than us, I was very proud all around of what we accomplished.  We will all admit we didn't get out of it what we hoped but that didn't stop us from pushing for our goal even if it wasn't as reachable.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
Not sure how many time's I paired with one of the mod-2 students but I would easily guess it was well over 3 times on multiple occassions with their projects.  This requirement I had either overlooked or forgot so I appologize for not keeping track.  This is an ongoing goal is to better explain what I can visualize in my head.  Data visualization is a strength but explaining the visualization is the opposite so doing these in small segments helps improve that skill.
