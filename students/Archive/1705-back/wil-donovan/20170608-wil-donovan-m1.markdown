# Wil Donovan - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Accomplishments in this module are a range of situations, moments, and items that have grown my knowledge base in the technological sense to my human-relations skills all the way to improvements in personal growth through attrition.  The goal of understanding and learning the technology was rougher than expected at first and came quicker than expected when it did.  It has opened a flood gate to being able to constantly learn and absorb varieties of information beyond code.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass


## B: Individual Work & Projects

In Mod-1 we completed two projects that were done individually that were extremely helpful, beneficial, and difficult.  Not only did these projects test and build knowledge with the ruby language but along with testing and building my skills and natural abilities/strengths.

Description
This project was my first test of keeping my head above water and did I barely.  I did this project wrong as I forgot to add in one subtraction step to completely validate the number.  Overall, while i missed that, I ended remaking this project 3 weeks later with ease and added the step in for the verification.  This project, of all the projects, provided the lease amount of knowledge growth through experimentation.

(adapted from Wikipedia)

The formula verifies a number against its included check digit, which is usually appended to a partial account number to generate the full account number. This full account number must pass the following test:

from the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, moving left, double the value of every second digit
if product of this doubling operation is greater than 9 (e.g., 7 * 2 = 14), then sum the digits of the products (e.g., 10: 1 + 0 = 1, 14: 1 + 4 = 5).
take the sum of all the digits
if and only if the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 then the number is valid


### Battle_Ship
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/swdonovan/Battleship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

Hands down the project that reassured me that I wasn't going to drown and that i couldn't handle the task of learning a software language.  This project was my favorite as I excelled quickly at getting through the logic and the components of this project with ease.  For what was an extremely difficult project I enjoyed the complexity and challenge.  I bit off too big of a chunk by starting with a 10 x 10 board and wasn't able to get it refactored back to spec in time before turning it in.  The choice to take on a 10 x 10 was mine alone and I still wouldn't have done it any other way as that extra challenge was extremely educational to me therefore the grade doesn't represent the variations in complexity along with many other factors

(1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

#### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

#### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

#### 4. Git Workflow

* PASS:  Developer demonstrates mastery of git and GitHub; commits with appropriate frequency, with clear, atomic commits that demonstrates a clear history.

#### 4. REPL Interface

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

#### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

#### 6. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.

### Jungle_Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/swdonovan/Jungle_Beats)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat)

This project I barely have recollection of.  It provided very little direction, education, and the only fact it proved to me was that I could get a project done regardless.  The concept of the project that is trying to be taught is incredibly on point but the absolute key concept of the project, that is integral for everything else the rest of the Mod, was poorly reasserted and this project ended up being a minor set up back for a variety of reasons that I was able to overcome.

#### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
#### 2. Looping or Recursion

1: Application struggles to loop/recurse at all
#### 3. Test-Driven Development

2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
#### 4. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
#### 5. Functional Expectations

2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.


## C: Group Work & Projects
### Night_Writer & Black_Thursday

Night-Writer---> In this project we were tasked with taking a text file and converting it back into braille, with the ability to take out of braille and return back to text if needed.

Black_Thursday---> In this project we had to learn how to manipulate multiple CSV files with thousands of lines of data, break it out and recurse back through the data to formulate the outputs of information we desired.  
### Night_Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/swdonovan/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer)

This project was incredibly important to getting object oriented programming understood.  In the end this project helped the 'clicking' factor with software language.  The first paired project couldn't have gone better.  It was a different feeling to have someone relying upon you and I figured my introverted ways would make it a pain to be paired, but the result was the opposite and the project went great.  File IO knowledge along with object oriented ways to program became incredibly clearer.

(Asssessed By: Ali)

Repo:
https://github.com/swdonovan/night_writer

Notes:
12 passing tests Utilized multiple classes
Broke methods down into smaller pieces, talked through options for runner methods vs ladder
Method and variable names communicated intent and functionality
Translates from eng to braille w/ 80 char truncation

Rubric:

#### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
#### 2. Test-Driven Development

2: Application makes use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).
#### 4. Functional Expectations

2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.


### Black_Thursday


* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/swdonovan/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)

Aboslute favorite project with in the first 6 weeks including all exercises etc.  This project gave us our first hands on real world example to code through and the amount of education that it provided was amazing.  There was serveral frustrations towards the end but fighting those frustrations with the spec harness proved to be valuable in the sense that we had to cycle through so many variations of data and live inside our code for so long that the inner workings of a computer could almost be seen.

## D: Professional Skills


###GEAR UP
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

This Gear up was a great to start Turing session off with.  It is a philosophy that I had strong opinions in favor of and that I tried to actively practice as much as possible.  If I had to pick a favorite session this was my favorite as it provides a great foundation for anyone that is about to go through the program.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

This gear up was extremely beneficial in introducing me to a variety of different methods, ways, and philosophies to break down cognitive drain along with managing stress.  Not only did this provide methods to keep up my cognitive resources but just to be conscious of it.  While I battle with this one being my favorite over the first, it pry holds the title of being one of the larger reasons I survived the first Turing the first 6 weeks.

####  Introvert/Extrovert/Ambivert
* [Github URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

This gear up was exceptionally beneficial and educational as I've never see the subjects of extroverts or introverts be openly discussed like such.  It was also an introduction of sorts to ambivert and the discussions with extroverts and getting to observe conversations around the room was exceptionally eductional.

#### Personal Story
* [Github URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

Personal Story gear up was one of my least participated in as telling stories can be extremely difficult.  As the process went on it became sort of easier but getting to hear other stories from other people and examine how they told the story or why they chose certain high points and inflections in their voice easily became the high point and most valuable aspect of this gear up.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap
* [Github URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

What an interesting topic that turned out to be fascinating.  While I never fully acknowledged the gender gap I found it extremely difficult to process from a logical stand point.  In an industry that I find so fit for women it was extremely difficult to know that male statements and frame and minds is what drives such a valuable factor to the success of technology.  Definitely intend to study further before making any opinions.

## E: Community Participation

While in the Turing community, I am confidently one of the least outwardly social and active students as I've stayed focused on the task of learning the technology side.  But while I've been here I have used one of my strength in Individualization to quietly get to know and provided some immense help to students from different Mod's.  While I am weak in the obvious extrovert sense I have been able to use this strength and method to assist me in building that weakness.
