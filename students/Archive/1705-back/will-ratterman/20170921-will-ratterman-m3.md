-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
>* Consuming APIs and OAuth, and accessing utilizing postman to view what returns given the HTTP verb and endpoint.
>* It was fun, I remember being really excited about the premise of consuming APIs and making records of those objects. As soon as I got comfortable with that process I remember I started working on a different project rather than full flush out my "github" clone.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* Building API endpoints, advanced ActiveRecord/SQL
>* Again, another interesting project. Building API endpoints was not very difficult and the bulk of the fun on this project was coming up with the SQL or ActiveRecord queries needed for the business analytics.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://shelter-in-need.herokuapp.com)**
>* I started to get burnt out pretty bad here

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://trail-upv2.herokuapp.com/)**

> Rales Engine evaluation comments:
Overall good.
Spec Harness fails 2
77 tests, 91 percent coverage
needs more unit tests
Some of the controllers have too much logic going on, more controllers needed to have been made
