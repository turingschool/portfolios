# (Will Ratterman) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this module was to understand the basic fundamentals of OOP through Ruby and develop the skills to be able to learn new languages and apply it using OOP?

## A: End of Module Assessment

I feel like I passed Module 1.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Projects at Turing represent the spectrum of human emotions. Confusion at first (maybe naive optimism), which leads to uncertainty about whether or not you are capable

#### (Credit Check)

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/wratterman/credit_check
* [Original Assignment] http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/credit_check

Credit Check was our first project, and the goal of the assignment was to create a program that would test a credit card number, run it through the Luhn Algorithm to verify if the number is valid. This process would return a statement confirming that a valid number is valid or that an invalid number is invalid. The specific steps of the algoritm can be found in the Original Assignment link above.

The evaluation I received for this was short, but I took that to be a good thing. Mike explained that there is no need to define an initialize function if there is nothing to be initialized inside a class, but nothing about the functionality. The code worked with every credit card number I could find and test.

#### (Jungle Beats)

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/wratterman/JungleBeats
* [Original Assignment] http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat

Jungle Beats was a project designed to teach us about linked lists and nodes and applying testing to drive our development. It was also to make your computer complete some sounds through terminal. Specific directions of the sounds to be stored in 'data' of each node or the methods that can be enacted on the list can be found in the different iterations in the original assignment link above.

I didn't finish this project, but besides the functional expectations I felt pretty good about my learning experience on it. This was this first "half done, not half-assed" situation I found myself in during this mod, and making sure I was implementing the concepts we had been learning during the module seemed more valuable than stumbling through to completion at the expense of TDD or encapsulation. I wanted to develop the right habits with coding.

- Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
- Looping or Recursion: 3
- Test-Driven Development: 3
- Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
- Functional Expectations: 2

#### (Battleship)

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/wratterman/battleship
* [Original Assignment] http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship

Battleship was a beast. An intentionally open-ended independent project that was testing our ability to connect files, break up a large scope of work into logical components, and creatively design the game functionality. The specific rules can be found in the link above.

Evaluating this project was a pleasant surprise. I felt like it kicked my ass, but I was determined to get the desired functionality done. I struggled through parts and gathered steam in others, but this was a big turning point in myself feeling
like this field of study could be something I can do.

- Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
- Enumberable & Collections: 3
- Git Workflow: PASS
- REPL Interface: 4
- Breaking Logic into Components: 3
- Functional Expectations: 3

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group Projects, preparing ourselves for the real dev world one difficult concept at a time. But that is where the value comes in. Learning to rely on others and opening communicate are great habits to start forming, as it should just translate well to the real world.

#### (NightWriter)

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/wratterman/NightWriter
* [Original Assignment] http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer

This was our first paired project of the mod as well as our primary introductions into File I/O. The idea of the project was to take a txt file with a message written in english, have your programs read the text, translate it to braille, and print the translated message into a new 'braille.txt' file as well as be able to do the opposite.

(evaluation comments) - Since this evaluation is not just representative of myself, I would prefer for it not to be public.

(evaluation scores) - Since this evaluation is not just representative of myself, I would prefer for it not to be public.

#### (Black Thursday)

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/swdonovan/black_thursday
* [Original Assignment] http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday

Black Thursday is a project about parsing through different merchant/consumer related CSVs from Etsy and be able apply statistical tests, group with other files, and return results for specific business inquiries.

## D: Professional Skills

Overall I have been pleased with the professional skills development side of Turing. There are times when I would prefer to be working on projects or other coding work, but the topics are interesting and make getting to know other Turing students a lot easier.

### Gear Up
#### (Growth Mindset)

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown

Out Gear up on growth mindset was actually very valuable to me. I definitely associated more with the descriptions of mixed mindset coming into Turing, but the thorough explanations and comparisons between the two definitely got me ready to conciously try to have a growth mindset.  

#### (Cohort Vision)

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_cohort_vision.markdown

Cohort Vision, while being valuable (as can be anything in life), was one of the Gear ups that seemed to almost be the same thing. Yes, the idea of pre-planning/setting goals to be accomplished can be a good thing. But ultimately it feels like these Gear Ups are directed at finding out more about your peers and realizing you can be much stronger as a unit that treats each other well than if you try conquer the world flying solo.

#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md

Getting better at difficult things spelled out what Turing's take on education is. A lot of people complain about it, and understandably so. The idea is to get better at accomplishing challenging tasks. You need to try and accomplish challenging tasks to get better at it, therefore students at Turing are constantly given difficult tasks. Agree with the idea 100%. Well played, Turing staff.

#### (Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!)

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown

Similar to Cohort Vision, this felt like a good reminder that we're all in this together. The introverts, the extroverts, and the ambiverts generally had different perceptions of their/other personalities, the goals and backgrounds of most people were super similar. Kind of reinforcing the idea 1 > 5: [open hand] -> "5 individuals" vs [closed fist] -> "one team". Which hits harder?

#### (Managing Stress and Coping Mechanisms)

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md

I don't really remember this Gear up specifically. Was this the one we learned about taking feedback? Or was that even a Gear up? Sheesh, looking through the github I imagine I said that I deal with stress predominantly with light-hearted sarcasm. In similar fashion, I feel like it ended up with a general consensus that the feeling of belonging to a community that you can rely on does wonders to help alleviate stress. And to belong to that community it is only fair to be there for others when they are dealing with their stressful situations.

#### (Public Narrative)

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_public_narrative.markdown

Public Narrative was a great Gear Up. Hearing about how others wanted themselves to be perceived? Right from there mouth? That is the best insight into someone's life you can hope for. Quite frankly I just enjoyed being apart of it.

#### (Personal Stories and Connection)

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown

Once again, I feel like Personal Stories was tied to Cohort Vision and Working Styles. Many of us had very similar stories and were looking for similar things (self-satisfaction, career-pride, etc.). However, it is cool to see people who are generally far more reserved than I open up about these stories and allow them to be a strength for themselves moving forward.

#### (Retrospective)

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_retrospective.markdown

Are these our weekly retros? If so, I dug those. They were a little more negative than I would have preferred but it gave a good opportunity for people to vent their frustrations and their classmates to bond.

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md

This was a heavy topic. How do we encourage women to get more involved in software development? How do we ensure that the environment we share with other coders isn't deliberately uncomfortable for women in a largely male dominated industry?

These are incredibly difficult questions that don't really have a clear right answer. I would think a strong marketing point should be the women were the original developers. Makes it pretty easy to refute the whole "computers are a man's thing" attitude a lot of people seem to have. But overall, it seems like something that can only be fixed by a cultural change driven by those within. Or aliens.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I recruited a friend for that Try Turing backend even this weekend.

I wasn't a part of a posse or anything along those lines this mod, however I do think that I was one of the primary vocal people in our mod. I have had individual conversations with each person in our group and hopefully I am viewed as easily approachable.

I have spent more time investing in my classmates and getting to know them than to the overall Turing Community.
