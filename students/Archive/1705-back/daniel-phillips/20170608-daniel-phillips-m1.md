# Daniel Phillips - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to learn the basics of OOP in a Ruby, and I wanted
to gain a better understanding of the types and depth of proficiencies
I'll need moving forward from OOP fundamentals in software development.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(N/A yet to receive)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Overall, I felt like the bulk of the reinforcing from the lessons was
borne out through these projects. Having time to sit with a project and
wrestle with various ideas we had seen (but maybe not used yet) proved to be a
boon for my own learning this module.

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dphilla/Jungle_Beat)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat)

A singly-linked list, meant to output sounds when all iterations are completed

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 4. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 5. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dphilla/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

a command line version of the classic Battleship game


Notes:
* Application runs but display of board doesnt work

Rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring


### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. Git Workflow

* FAIL: Developer does not commit often, commits are overly large, poor commit messages. Drastic changes in code in a single commit.

### 4. REPL Interface

* 1: Application's REPL has enough problems as to make play difficult

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear


### 6. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

These projects helped to reinforce concepts from class, but really pushed
us to find strategies for working well on challenging issues with another
person.

#### Night writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thedanielvogelsang/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer)

Writes and decodes braille to new files

Notes:
* Application works. Translates to and fro.
* Very light on testing, some tests do not run, a lot of tests were skipped.
* think about the pattern of methods sending and receiving messages with a method that coordinates
all of the actions rather than having a bunch of methods just modify instance variables.
* avoid using single letter variables - be as expressive and communicative with your code as possible.
* Watch indentation and whitespace - look into using a linter such as rubocop.

Rubric:


### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring


### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate use of TDD, or an insufficient number of tests.

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.


### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mikeyduece/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)

simple business data analytics software


## D: Professional Skills

I really enjoyed these sessions as an excellent counterpart to the technical
side of things at Turing.

#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL]()

I feel like this was fundamental and I'm glad it came first. Developing a Growth
Mindset is the perfect way to kick of Turing, and it's something that is only
helpful as a student moves through the program and face ever-mounting
challenges and pressure. It's really foundational.

#### Getting Better at Different Things

* [GitHub URL]()

I thought that this was good, especially as far as its placement in
the curriculum. Right when your starting to learn some things that start to
feel somewhat overwhelming, this was a great reminder to focus on the
process and continue to stay focused.

#### Introverts, Extroverts, and Ambiverts

* [GitHub URL]()

I thought this session helped us to break out of our normal groups and
interact with people who shared different worldview and experience from
their own approaches to handling social situations. I often struggle to find
exact and discrete meaning in terms like "introvert" or "extrovert", but I
do think that there are benefits to having such definitions as guides for
working with other people.

#### Developing your story

* [GitHub URL]()

This was an important step in the developing of out brand. I think starting
with this general approached helped us to outline the various ways we
can work into entering the job market eventually.

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL]()

This was a great Gear Up where we had so many opportunities to broach some
really difficult discussions. I was really happy with the depth of discussion,
and I'm really glad it was part of the curriculum.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I felt like this was one area that I'd like to seriously improve on in
future sessions. Outside of my cohort, I didn't really engage in too
many community events apart from attending one posse meeting and casually
interacting with upper mod students.
