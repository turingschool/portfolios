# (Larisa Anderson) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I entered M1/round 2 feeling confident that it would "click". The first few weeks felt wonderful!
I was able to answer questions from my peers, which felt great. I was looking forward to being a teacher within M1 to solidify my own learning, and help others as others have helped me.
Being a part of Turing has led me down paths internally that I thought I had already traveled on. Which for a divorced mother of 2...Means a lot. I've had internal talks with myself that have led to acceptance, appreciation and most of all growth.  I feel very fortunate for the experience of Turing and the community that comes with it. I have learned more about compassion that I thought possible! Did I mention I am a mother of 2?
My cohort this mod is truly a blessing as connections have been made, and their support has been amazing. I have truly enjoyed programming this mod. I had several different "wins" conceptually that I was looking for in the previous mod. So looking on the positive side, I feel that I have grown immensely this mod.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Transitioning from a stay at home mother to full-time + student has been.. a struggle. A long struggle. I feel like at the end of this mod I am finally realizing the time that I need to put in to myself and Turing. I can thank Sal for that. In an evaluation he made a comment about looking at other avenues in the tech world besides becoming a developer. That led to a long reflection of myself, reflecting on my efforts, my passions, and my family. So going back to individual work and projects.....I am proud of myself. I didn't make the best choices, but I did grow as a programmer, and most of all I know for certain that I want to be a developer. I really enjoy learning, and the growth that comes with it.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I have always enjoyed working and collaborating with people. I enjoy the process of putting our strengths together to solve a problem. I am very much a team oriented person, I get great satisfaction when my strengths are utilized just as much as the next person. During this mod I only had the opportunity to to a team project once. Our DTR was not followed by my partner and this created a project that was not something to be proud of. It gave me a great deal of appreciation for implementing DTR's, and also enabled me to realize where my weaknesses are. I can be passive to not create conflict. I now know that in the future I need to be assertive, and be the leader that I am.

(In this project weâ€™ll implement systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse.)

(I would like to start off by recognizing what I did to stall progress on the project. We didn't have time to work together over the first few days of the project, and instead of managing my stress better, I dove into the project and wrote code that may not have been the direction you would have taken. This is all speculation and conjecture, but my guess is that my early work on the project left you at a disadvantage. I can only imagine if the situation had been reversed, I would have had a hard time trying to figure out what you were doing. I should have waited, or maybe just written tests. I know this is supposed to be my feedback for you, but I can't really see anything you could have improved on, because I didn't really give you room to do so. I created a difficult situation by not communicating initially and by somewhat expecting you to be on board with how I started coding the project. If I was hard pressed to come up with something to give as feedback I would say that deleting code and starting over doesn't have to be a bad thing, especially if what is on screen isn't exactly working. I understand this may be a style difference, so I'm not even sure it's good feedback. I feel as though our DTR was unsuccessful and inaccurate, and I'm not entirely sure why. The concept of pairing on a project seemed simple and straightforward at first, but when working together on something that we are beginners at it adds unforeseen levels of complexity. I wish the project had gone better on multiple levels, but I realize that I played a huge part in derailing it.)

## D: Professional Skills
I feel that Turing has done such an amazing job at creating a community where people of all walks of life can come and experience personal growth.

### Playing a Part

My first day at Turing was exciting and terrifying at the same time. I still felt like it
was a dream that I was given this opportunity to be here. I made friends quickly, and paired with upper-mods
to gain knowledge on minor but very important things like, how to set up my computer for the most efficient way to work. I also became a mentee to Dave Maurer. I stayed long nights and through staying at Turing late and putting in my time I made connections with front-end student and back-end student alike. I also joined the imposters group at Turing. Having support really helped shape my idea of myself, as I was coming into Turing with absolutely no programing experience and on top of that being a stay at home mom since 2009. I'll never forget Ellen Mary talking about how you will be drinking from a fire hose. That is a great analogy!
I feel that my eagerness to learn and learn from others made me approachable for other students to confide in me about their own struggles.
Moving forward I want to be able to encourage single mothers to make the leap and try programming. It is a field that utilizes creativity and effective communication. It also can enable a woman to be able to provide for her family, and help close the gender gap by showing her children that women can be strong developers. ``
