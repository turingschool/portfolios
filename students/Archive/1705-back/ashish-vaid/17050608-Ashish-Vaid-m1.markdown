#### (Jungle Beats)

* https://github.com/vaidashi/jungle_beats
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat)

(description)

This project in the beginning was a little difficult to understand conceptually, but once I was able to understand it I made progress. It was also helpful to communicate with other students who were also stuck and even though it wasn't a group project, it was extremely beneficial to work in a collaborative manner and build off each others' understanding. I only wish it had happened sooner and I would've been able to make additional progress.

(evaluation comments)

The functionality that is there is well written
9 tests, all passing


(evaluation scores)

1:Fundamental Ruby & Style
  (3) Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

2:Looping or Recursion
  (3) Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

3:Test-Driven Development
  (3) Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

4:Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  (3) Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

5:Functional Expectations
  (2) Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.

REPL Interface

#### (Battleship)

* https://github.com/vaidashi/Battleship
* [Original Assignment]http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship

(description)

This project in the beginning was easy to understand conceptually, but implementing it proved to be a huge challenge. In my opinion, each Individual class or piece I was able to construct logically, but ultimately the project did not come together in the end as required as pieces of the overall functionality were missing. It was the first project to require more than two class objects integrating and working with each other. I noted the vast majority of the class encountering this same issue and it was interesting to compare and review our respective projects since there were numerous possibilities in implementing a solution.

(evaluation comments)

Application runs, but does not allow placement of ships.
There are some gnarly conditionals
Classes are generally broken out well
Liked seeing a messages class.



(evaluation scores)

1:Fundamental Ruby & Style
  (2) Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

2:Enumerable & Collections
  (3) Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

3:Test-Driven Development
  (1) Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

4:Git Workflow
  PASS: Developer demonstrates mastery of git and GitHub; commits with appropriate frequency, with clear, atomic commits that demonstrates a clear history.

4:REPL Interface
  (3) Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

5:Breaking Logic into Components
  (3) Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

6:Functional Expectations
  (2) Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.









## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(File IO)

#### (Night Writer)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Mcents/Night_Writer)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer)

(description)

From the collaboration perspective, this project went really well and my partner and I worked very well together. We had challenges in the beginning in understanding the project and coming up with the necessary solutions, but through some effective pairing sessions we were able to increase our progress and came away with what I felt was a very successful project overall.  

(evaluation comments)

Limited night read tests.
Practice the pattern of methods sending and receiving messages to each other rather than modifying a single instance variable.
All code files should go in the lib directory
Alphabet class needs some tests - all classes should have a test file, all methods should have at least one test.
Application fully functional - minor bug where output text counts line breaks.


(evaluation scores)

1:Fundamental Ruby & Style
  (3) Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

2:Test-Driven Development
  (2) Application makes use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

3:Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  (3) Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

4:Functional Expectations
  (3)Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

(feedback to me)

Thank you for everything you put into this project. It was a great pleasure to have a partner who communicated his thoughts and feelings on things so well. I think it led to us being able to tackle some of the big hurdles we came across. It was also really appreciated that you were willing to stay late multiple times to ensure we completed the goals we set. It allowed us to avoid any conflicts with remote work and have one streamlined vision. I think the only thing that let us down was our lack of understanding of the spec early on. Not realizing that our project wasn't working probably cost us a few days that could have gone to refactoring. But we pivoted better than I thought we would be able to. Especially those last few days, your understanding of TDD was invaluable. Not only that, but your time management and conscious effort to remind us to take the breaks we needed, was more than helpful. I know early in the project, with me driving  you got lost in some of the methods. But it was clear by the end of the project that your understanding of control flow and methods had grown greatly. This was evident with your tests and your descriptions in our evaluations.


## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Growth Mindset)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

I found this to be a very helpful lecture piece overall and especially as it relates to our work here in learning programming and development. Learning how to maintain a paradigm where you are constantly inquisitive and not discouraged when things do not come easy is extremely important and not easy for most people, including me at times. As with most things, it's an effort to maintain, but well worth it.


### Gear Up
#### (Working Styles: Extroverts and Introverts)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

This was a good lecture to understand communication challenges and how they may relate to our individual personalities. I have attended similiar types of seminars in the past and it's always good to get some reinforcement on good interpersonal skills to develop especially as an introvert.


### Gear Up
#### (Personal Stories and Connection)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

My takeaway from this was tied into the previous gear-up on personality types and how they relate to communication and work. I've attended networking events in the past and I've come to understand the importance of pitching and telling your story in a concise and effective manner. It's still a challenge for me to talk about myself and I know I have to get better at this.  


### Gear Up
#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

I had seen the documentary that was related to his gear-up prior to attending Turing. I found it interesting to see this movie and gain further insight into the issue. It was good to see the statistics and figures tied into the topic that was discussed and reviewing that afterwards within our small groups; particularly, in mine where there were female students present.



## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)

Attending the demo nights, a few of the morning guest speaker sessions. Looking to join two Posse groups (Wozniak, Blockchain) in the next module.
