>* Really struggled this module to stay on track and be invested in certain areas. I felt out of place at first in the new module and had some sickness in the middle of the module. Add in the fact that my girlfriend ended up being able to visit for 2 weeks, I was very checked out for a lot of it.
I definitely got the learning I needded from the repeat, but feel that I could have utilized my school time better and gotten more out of the classes if I had kept a sense of focus/urgency.
I hope to come back to Mod 4 with a refreshed mindset and ready to invest fully in the Turing space and help the community as I have in former modules.

## Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* Enjoyed Rales engine far more this time through as I felt I knew what was going on and was confident in how to proceed at each step.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/bretfunk/palpit8)**
>* Favourite project so far at Turing. Really enjoyed the group and really enjoyed the project. Only project I have truly revisted and continued to work on.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://github.com/markyv18/SQUEEE)**
>* This project I was far less motivated for and so didn't get as much out of(because I didn't put as much in). I think the project we inherited was very well done and I don't think we took away from the original while adding nice features alongside theirs.
