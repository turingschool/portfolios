# Katie Keel - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to learn how to pull data in from external sources into an app, and I wanted to learn how to use Devise. I did both of those things.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

**[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
* My project used the Github API to build a somewhat-clone of Github's basic functionality.
* I wish I had known earlier about using a PORO to return JSON.


## B: Group Work & Projects

**[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
* We used the Sales Engine data to build an internal API using advanced ActiveRecord.
* We knocked this one out of the park. Eddie was a great project partner and I was pretty proud of what we accomplished.

**[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
**[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://turing-professionals.herokuapp.com/)**
* Our project was a Turing-only clone of LinkedIn.
* I learned a ton during this project, including the importance of protecting Github branches, when to give up on something that just isn't working, and a little bit of Javascript and AJAX. Although this project didn't turn out as well as we wanted it to, I think the final product was still pretty good.

**[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://recruit-me-80202.herokuapp.com/)**
* Our project was an app to facilitate the recruitment of middle school basketball players.
* I learned how to retrofit Devise into an existing app in this project (lesson learned: not easy!), why single table inheritance is just the worst, and how to work with brownfield code. I did enjoy working on this project.

## C. **Gear Ups**

The Gear Ups this mod were better than the ones in mod 2, in my opinion. The student-led one was probably my favorite. We managed to have a great discussion about an issue on which pretty much everyone in the room disagreed. My only suggestion would be to tell the Mod 4 students to have a hand-raising system instead of an open floor discussion; people just end up talking over each other.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
* I wrote a [blog post](https://medium.com/@katiekeel/succeed-in-group-work-require-pr-reviews-eb72b93c90fe) about the importance of protecting a project's branches on Github.

#### **Posse**
* To be honest, my posse hasn't really done anything this mod. Most of us are incredibly tired by Friday afternoon, and we end up playing Settlers of Catan or working on the puzzle in the FE4 classroom. My recommendation is just to cut out posses entirely and let students leave after Gear Up and retro on Friday - not because I don't believe in mingling with your fellow students, but because most people don't even show up, and having an extra hour off at the end of the week would be a realy nice perk.
