# Katie Shermer - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I wanted to gain a strong understanding of the principles of object-oriented programming, something I feel I achieved. I also wanted to get to know my classmates, something I achieved as well.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Overall, I think I show a strong understanding of OOP principles, including writing methods, using classes and modules, abstraction, and testing overall. While my projects may not have been perfect, particularly testing and refactoring on Battleship, I feel my work has shown that I understand and can implement the concepts of Module 1 competently, and that I should be passed on to Module 2.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Our individual projects this module were Credit Check, Date Night, and Battleship.

#### Credit Check

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/katieshermer/credit-check)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/credit_check)

I feel that this project really showed that I went to Second Shift; I implemented a class and discrete methods before the class structure had been taught in class. Overall, I think this project showed early promise of my potential to understand OOP, especially encapsulation, and it's probably one of the better projects I've submitted considering its complexity in relation to what the class as a whole had learned at the time.

#### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/katieshermer/date-night)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/date_night)

In Date Night, we built a binary search tree, implementing a conceptual data structure taught in computer science courses. I appreciated the knowledge that this project gave me about computer science; while it was extremely difficult at the time, I feel accomplished for having understood it at all and that I was able to get any of the methods working whatsoever. This project also taught me recursion, thanks to the help of my classmates, a concept that proved extremely valuable in our next project, Complete Me.


Evaluation notes:

Assessed By: Mike

* 10 tests, all passing
* make sure that tests are actually looking for the information you care about
* need tests for node
* functionality works until sort, depth of does not work


Evaluation scores:

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

2. Test-Driven Development

2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Functional Expectations

2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.


#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/katieshermer/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

In Battleship, we recreated the board game in code using a REPL interface with the terminal. This was a huge project to complete solo, and I'm pretty proud I actually got it working. My relatively lower scores on this project were due to not having enough time to refactor, plus the inherent difficulty of testing a REPL game's input and output. I feel I would have achieved higher scores had the expectations been more clear; while a 3 on functionality was great, I'm still not sure whether the instructors considered a 2 on functionality to be "good enough" for this project if the other scores were 3s and above. Also, there were many small rules and conditions in the spec that were difficult and sometimes tedious to implement, and that weren't checked during the evaluation, something I (again) found somewhat frustrating with regard to final grading. Overall, I'm happy with this project, and I actually went back to refactor even after my evaluation just because I wanted it to be better.


Evaluation Notes:

Assessed By: Mike

* Application works and is LOTR themed
* A lot of repetitiion in the player board and computer board
* Use some predicate methods to simplify readability


Evaluation Scores:

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

2. Enumerable & Collections

3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

3. Test-Driven Development

2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

4. Git Workflow

FAIL: Developer does not commit often, commits are overly large, poor commit messages. Drastic changes in code in a single commit.

4. REPL Interface

3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

5. Breaking Logic into Components

2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

6. Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Our group projects this mod were Complete Me, in which we built a retrieval Trie, and Black Thursday, where we built a relational database by hand.

#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/katieshermer/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/complete_me)

Complete Me was the project that almost broke me. Bret and I were a great project pair, but we both struggled mightily with the suggest method, which was the fundamental Trie traversal and retrieval method underlying the entire purpose of the project. Despite working at it nonstop for 3 days and recruiting help from upper mod students as well as instructors, we were only able to complete it on the Wednesday before the due date thanks to Ellen Cooper, another student. I wish we had understood that looking at other students' code was allowed and necessary a lot sooner in the project. Overall, I'm extremely proud of our work on this project, especially considering we only had 2.5 weeks of programming knowledge at this point, whereas computer science students probably don't learn this concept until much later in their education.

Evaluation Comments:

Assessed By: Sal


Evaluation Scores:

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

2. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

4. Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.


Bret's feedback to me:

"I felt that I could not have a better partner than Katie.  I thought she grossly overestimated my abilities when she told me she wanted to partner with me but everything went really well: teamwork, worth ethic, maintaining a positive attitude when we were frustrated, using our strengths and weaknesses, and I even received free coffee from her barista boyfriend.  Katie has a real strength in debugging and testing and I learned a lot from her and I probably wouldn't have been able to solve our smart suggest method in time without watching her debugging mastery with pry and our test suite. I am struggling to find things that could have gone better other than things I need to personally improve on.  Other than us not figuring out the problem with our code until Wednesday afternoon we really had no problems, in my opinion.  I do think that I would have never solved the suggest method on my own and I should have tried harder.  Thankfully Katie was there and got the problem solved.  I also think I need to improve my debugging and testing methods. I felt all of these things before but after talking with other classmates who did not have such a smooth partnering experience I am even more grateful for Katie being my pairing partner."

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/katieshermer/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)

Black Thursday, the final project of the mod, taught us to create and use a database from scratch. This is something that upper mod students have cited as extremely valuable knowledge going forward in order to truly understand OOP and the databases we'll be using later in our education and careers. While this project has been large and complex, I felt the abstraction to be approachable after Date Night and Complete Me, and the first three iterations posed no problems for us as a project pair. Where this project got "difficult" was in Iteration 4/5, and I think most of the class shares our sentiment that significant portions of the spec and spec harness in Iteration 4/5 (and only those iterations!) for this project are, at turns, either far too vague or outright contradictory/nonsensical in order to make meaningful progress on many of the methods required. Without instructor help we would have never known how to make a large portion of the spec harness pass for Iteration 4, and we still don't at the time of this writing. Other than that, I think this project has proved immensely useful to our objectives for Module 1, which is understanding abstraction as it relates to OOP, and I'm glad we were assigned it.

## D: Professional Skills

Our professional skills classes in Mod 1 included Gear Ups, where we discussed social problems in the tech industry as well as the world at large, and professional development sessions, where we learned about working styles and personal branding.

### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

I found the growth mindset Gear Up to be valuable, especially as it came so early in the mod. While I personally already ascribed to the values of the growth mindset, I did still have some ideas about my strengths as they related to "hard science" that this session helped me dispel. As it happens, as long as you understand logic and language, you understand programming, two things I already knew I was good at. In general, I appreciated this session especially for its positivity.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

This session addressed how to persevere when you feel drained, an extremely relevant topic to Turing students. I found Kathy Sierra's talk on managing cognitive resources to be interesting. I definitely used some of her suggestions later in the module. Overall, I enjoyed this Gear Up and found it helpful.

#### Intro/Extro/Ambiverts

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

I personally found this session to be the least helpful Gear Up we participated in. I lean toward the ambivert side of introversion, and I feel the discussion mostly centered around the concept of introversion as social anxiety, which is inaccurate and not really helpful to our goals at Turing. I did enjoy my time speaking to students from other modules, and I appreciate the use of that tactic during our Gear Ups.

#### Personal Stories and Connection

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

As someone who's been on many job interviews, I appreciated this session for the opportunity it gave us to hone our "elevator pitch" for ourselves. This ability will be extremely useful in the future when we're looking for jobs. It was also helpful to reflect upon why we were at Turing, especially in week 4, when projects were becoming difficult and the light at the end of the tunnel seemed to be dimming.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

I appreciate Turing's courage for devoting a large chunk of time to this topic, especially given the current surge of feminism and also backlash against it. I was a women's studies minor in college and this topic is of great interest to me. I also appreciated my classmates for their willingness to engage with the ideas and not just dismiss them out of hand, and the overall quality of the discussion.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I organized a happy hour outing one Friday as well as a hike over Memorial Day weekend. While not specific to the goals of Turing, I know these events increased the camaraderie of many of our classmates.
