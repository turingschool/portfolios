# Matt DeVoe - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

The only specific goal I had was to absorb as much as I could and do as well as possible. Coming into the program I thought I knew what to expect from a course material perspective, but I truly didn't. As the days and weeks progressed, my areas of focus distilled into Ruby Fundamentals, taking the gear-ups and PDs to heart and working with others as much as possible.


## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I truly don't know whether I should be moving to Mod 2. In some areas, I feel comfortable with the material and believe that I know more than I think I do. However, part of the time, I still find myself struggling with proper vocabulary. Additionally, there are areas that I feel I don't know backwards and forwards. For example, I would like to work more on Modules, Advanced Enumerables and refactoring old projects.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

There has been a drastic change between my first and final solo project. On credit check, I felt overwhelmed and lost. During Battleship, at times I felt overwhelmed, but knew this would pass. From a technical perspective, my skills improved drastically. My ability to time box improved, but not to the levels I would like (this is an area for continued improvement). With Battleship, I certainly didn't know all the answers, but I knew how to incrementally build using TDD and deconstruct remaining issues through a variety of ways.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

  I very much enjoyed the group work and, especially, the projects. Having a second person with different perspectives and strengths helped not only create unique and better project, but it also served as an incredible learning opportunity. My quality of understanding and ability to contribute drastically increased between the two group projects.

* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer)

Evaluation Comments:
  Application translates english to braille.
  Would like to have seen more testing - Every class should have its own test, every method should have at least one corresponding test at minimum.
  IN the future, depend less on instance variables to do your information sharing for you - methods should be sending and recieving messages.

    1. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
    2. Test-Driven Development: 1

Evaluation Comments:
  None yet.

Evaluation Scores:
  None yet.



## D: Professional Skills

  Overall, I found the professional skills development sessions useful. The StrengthsFinder Assessment is informative in providing deeper personal context and understanding to how I approach not only work, but the world in general.

  The original sessions regarding personal branding and story telling were lost on me at first. However, our latest session detailing the application of these stories shed new light on the importance of personal branding and how this will affect our potential careers in (hopefully) a few months.

  On a separate note, I previously read and applied "Thanks for the Feedback" for an unrelated business course. It's refreshing to see the principles applied and reinforced throughout the program as I believe the book hit the feedback nail on the head.


### Gear Up

#### (Growth Mindset)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

  "Not yet..." This is the proper headspace to inhabit. At Turing, we're dealing with complex, unfamiliar and often abstract concepts/problems. These things don't come naturally to 99.9% of the population. It takes work, discipline and an open mind to improve. The reason I/we are not good at a thing is not due to innate ability, it's time and energy spent on said thing.

  I try to stay conscientious of my particular triggers and when I move away from a Growth Mindset. So far, I haven't descended too far into a downward spiral, hopefully this trend continues.

#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

  Each of us has a limited tank of cognitive resources. To paraphrase from Kathy Sierra, we suffer from death by a thousand cognitive leaks. The little things that we haven't mastered, but require effort, tax our cognitive resources. There are several ways to decrease/improve our cognitive resources. This includes moving skills from the A category (Can't, but need to do) to the C category (Mastered). Additionally, there are a number of other ways to alleviate cognitive load, including proper lifestyle factors, practicing skills in the "B" category and knowing when to ask for help.

#### (Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

  Unfortunately, I couldn't attend this session. I left late-morning on 5/19 due to a health issue. In reviewing the material, it looks as if I'm an ambivert. I'm happy to communicate and work in an extroverted style with others. However, I very much enjoy working alone at times as well. This can vary project-to-project and day-by-day.

#### (Personal Stories & Connection)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

  This was a really interesting session. Not only did this help set the stage for future personal branding, but I found it enlightening to hear others' stories, thoughts and motivations. This session ignited a personal retrospective. The journey to get into Turing was a whirlwind. It took a good amount of reflection and quiet time to reacquaint myself with why I'm here and what I value (learning, the desire to build and contribute, the love of technology, etc.)

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

  It's difficult to deliver feedback on a topic that I won't experience as the victim. This takes a good amount of empathy and effort to grasp what the non-male experience is.

  The sexism, discrimination and inherent bias against women (and other groups) exists. The question is how to drive progress forward in the tech community but also address the cause in addition to the symptoms. Cultural conditioning plays a heavy role. But so do the cultures of the tech world at large. The gender gap is now so widely recognized that it's become a punchline. Like most changes, it starts at the individual/grass roots level. Notice when there may be biased behavior. Call it out.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

  From a larger community level, I attended class every day save one due to an unforeseen medical issue. I was here early and I left late nearly every day. I spent 90% of my weekends at Turing. I participated in  spikes, several of the guest speakers and took advantage of the mentors (students and graduates).

  I tried to be a positive influence and an aid to others during Mod 1. I am/was not the strongest student. However, I tried to lend a helping hand to anyone else struggling with an issue, code-based or otherwise.

  This will sound silly, but every day I bring with me a plush football. We use this as a fun distraction for those working late. It gives us a mental break and helps build a bit of camaraderie.

  In the future, I would like to participate in a posse and serve as a student mentor to a Mod 1 student.
