# (Bret Funk) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to develop a strong foundation of the Ruby programming language as well as learning efficient ways of breaking down problems and then solving them.

## A: End of Module Assessment



## B: Individual Work & Projects

My Individual projects went very well in my opinion.  I did not finish Date Night so that still bothers me and I wish I could refactor Battleship one more time but both taught me a lot about the Ruby programming language and I thought they were both very fun projects.  

#### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brettt/date_night)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/date_night)

######description
Date night was a binary search tree project.  It was way over my head at the beginning but by the end I understood everything pretty well but didn't finish due to time constraints (I think we were only given three days).

######evaluation comments
_Evaluated by Mike_
24 tests, all passing
Completed including load
used smart node_approach
Some opportunties to refactor, some repetitiion in conditionals
FileIO should be pulled out of node to another class

######evaluation scores
_Fundamental Ruby & Style_
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

_Test-Driven Development_
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

_Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components_
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

_Functional Expectations_
2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brettt/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

######description
Battleship was a project that forced students to use a lot of class integration and ORM, as well as build a basic artifical intellegence algrorithm and visual display to the command line. I didn't think I was able to do this initially so I was plesantly surprised when I did.

######evaluation comments
_Evaluated by Mike_
Computer and player shouldnt access each others boards, battleship should access both
Work is divided a bit inconsistently
Move the stuff in the runner into Battleship

######evaluation scores
_Fundamental Ruby & Style_
2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

_Enumerable & Collections_
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

_Test-Driven Development_
2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

_Git Workflow_
PASS: Developer demonstrates mastery of git and GitHub; commits with appropriate frequency, with clear, atomic commits that demonstrates a clear history.

_REPL Interface_
3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

_Breaking Logic into Components_
2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

_Functional Expectations_
3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects could not have been more different because of the pairs I was partnered with.  Katie and Ash could not be more different in work style and ruby knowledge level so it was an interesting dichotomy.  Beyond the paring, the group projects were my favorite projects and felt the most useful in the world beyond Turing.  

#### (CompleteMe)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/katieshermer/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/complete_me)

######description
CompleteMe pushed Katie and I to build a trie structure that was able to autocomplete suggested words out of a dictionary.  This was fun but hard.  Katie and I were the perfect team.  We worked both together and seperately and got the project finished with all 3s and 4s.

#### (Black Thursday)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brettt/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)

######description
Black Thursday was my favorite project so far and taught me the most about classes and objects.  I always felt that classes and objects were something I was below average in understanding but no longer!  I also LOVED learning about how you can go into an individual object and pull out information.  It took me a while to understand the concept of what was actually happening but once I did it really clicked and I pumped out iterations 1, 2, and 3 in 3-4 days.  I am sad I didn't complete the full project but I know I gave it my all.

4: Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills
When I first applied to Turing, as a minority in a third-world-country, I was a little worried that these gear up sessions would be a bunch of spoiled Americans complaining about how hard they have it.  However, I have found them to be very interesting and informative.  I have read a lot of the books covered in Mod1 gear ups so I was already aware of a lot of these concepts but it was still enjoyable to talk about the ideas with others.  I especially like and believe in the idea of the "growth mindset."

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown

“Whether you think you can or whether you think you can't, you're right.” - Henry Ford
Turing agrees with Ford that you can do anything with enough work and enough time as long as you believe in yourself.  

#### Getting Better At Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md

As we say in the military, "embrace the suck".  Find pleasure in pushing yourself to your limits is the secret to Turing and to life in general.  Embracing the suck is also the best way to learn something.  Reminds me of that great quote that an expert is someone who is made every possible mistake in a narrow field.

#### Invert / Extrovert

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown

Some people are introverts, some people are extroverts, think about things from there point of view before you make any assumptions.  Just because someone is quiet and/or loud does not mean they are disengaged from everyone else.  

#### Personal Story

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown

Develop your personal story, make sure it has a narriative.  Use the narriative to tell your story to the world (especailly though social media and other public forums).

#### Debugging The Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md

The history of technology includes a lot of discrimination against women.  This discrimination can still be seen and felt in many places.  Don't discriminate.  Be the change you want to see in the world.

#### Universal Basic Income (Mod4 Students)

As machines continue to replace humans in the workplace, many feel that eventually a universal basic income, or socialism with a new face, will be unavoidable.  I was one of the only students who had concerns about 'free money': 1st, where is the money coming from?  Taxing robots is essentially taxing the internet.  Should Turing students be taxed every time they compile a program?  2.  Who is in control of distribution?  Congress will screw this up for sure, and that is the best case.  If all of the money comes from one person in charge of the government they will never lose an election because they will always offer to raise the limit.  If the limit goes up but productivity (and therefore taxes) do not then society will collapse.  3.  How will this change society?  If everyone received $60k per year, how would this change the economy?  My guess is it would devalue the currency like it's a bolivar and the economy would behave very erratically.  

I am not opposed to the UBI, I just think these questions need answers before it can be taken seriously.   

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Inside the Mod1 classroom I always try to be very helpful and supportive to my fellow classmates.  When partnering with someone who knows less I do my best of explaining things as much as possible even if it slows down our project progress.  

Inside the Turing Community I am active in the Armstrong posse and am attempting to build a blockchain testnet using a raspberry pi so the Turing community can test ethereum apps internally.  I have already built a working ethereum node and I know how to make an ethereum testnet, I just need to figure out how to do them together so Turing can always have a working testnet that any student can use to develop blockchain apps on the ethereum platform.

Outside of the classroom I have done two national interviews as a Turing student and promote Turing inside Operation Code, a coding organization to teach veterans to code.  Op Code is how I found Turing so I want to make sure I am helping others make the right choice and join the Turing community.  

Most importantly, I have started an electronics recycling program where I take Mod1 BE's unused phones and tablets and give them to the crippling poor in Ecuador, a collapsing third-world-country.  So far I have collected three phones that I will personally hand out on behalf of the Turing community.  I hope to expand this program Turing wide starting Mod2 if I avoid customs shakedowns during my first run.
