# Desislava Todorova M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

To build on the foundational knowledge acquired during Mod 1 and Mod 2.

## Self-Assessment

| Section | Category | Score |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 4 |
| B | **Individual Work & Projects** | 3 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 3 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 3 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 3 |

>* It was a very challenigng mod, especially navigating group projects, learning, and personal responsibilities. However,
I feel that I learned a lot and I think I am prepared to begin my job hunt; however, I feel tired and that there were
a number of situations that I don't believe were handled well and were emotionally tolling. I feel there was not enough feedback
even when I tried to receive more. This is the first time I questioned my place in the Turing communiity.

My goals for the future are to continue to learn how to implement new technologies, to solidify what I already know how to do,
to move past the mental hurdles I've encountered and to find a job that is a good match for me. I would like to find a way to
utiliize the Turing resources better than I did in the previous 3-4 weeks.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious]https://github.com/DesTodo/apicurious_github **
>* First project experimenting with consuming a 3rd party API and O.Auth.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine] https://github.com/DesTodo/rails_engine **

>* This is the first project of mod 3 and also a pair project. It was challenging to try to learn and implement the newly introduced
material (building an external API) while working with someone who had just come back to Turing after taking time away. There were not concrete
expectations and tools provided ahead of time for how to bridge the gap in workflow habits and to reintroduce someone to the Turing community.
As a team, we ran into a lot of differences regarding how to use Git Workflow and what the purpose for it is, as well as with
Slack communication even though we seemed to agree during DTR. I felt burdened with re-introducing someone to the Turing expectations and challeneged to be a respectful
project partner and to excell as a student at the same time. We ended up losing a lot of time by reintroducing errors and overwriting files.
Some of my code was changed without my knowledge. I am proud we completed the project regardless of the added stress, and we received pasing grades
on all rubrics but one. I understand and value Git comments and tools more. This made me appreciate past group experiences where this was not such an issue,
and has reinforced my desire to be active in following good Git practice in future group projects.

This was a very interesting project to dive into. It was the first time to work on a team of 6 and to immulate having a product owner
and daily stand ups. I really liked having that structure and feeling like it was a real team effort. We had a dedicated
PR person each day, and that was really helpful, but also time consuming. My PR day was Sunday, and I spent 90% of the day
reviewing code, debugging, merging and deplying to Heroku. I really liked using Travis CI to double check our work, although it
significantly slowed down the process. I felt like we were using real-world practices for the first time and I was eager to
build on that experience. Initially, I worked on setting up the polymorphic databases and on whatever needed to be worked on throughout.
My personal feature didn't ship because I wasn't able to  debug in time and pass the CI, this was
due to design changes made at the last minute and bugs were being reintroduced; but I was able to consume the Glassdoor API
successfully and to automatically generate company records in our database upon the entry of a company name by a user.
Dealing with the same Git issues like I did in the previous project and despite trying really hard, we were not
able to move past it as a team and people were unhappy.
However, I was really impressed with the risks and features my fellow team members took and with their accomplishments.

>* We inherited a project from the previous mod 3 and we were instructed to polish it and experiment by implementing new and challenging
features. I was excited to work with a completely new group of people.
There were many parts to the app, and many of them seemed to not be funcitonal. We had to explore the exisiting setup,
figure out what keys we need, and debug exisiting errors.
Everyone wanted to take ownershipp over the new feature they were working to implement. Will and I decided to build a chatbot
to make hiking recommendations, and we used the Watson Conversation platform to teach a bot how to reply when prompted.
There was a steep learning curve to figuring out how the patterns work and that took almost 3 days. Next, we wanted to
implement Twilio to make the bot interative over text message instead of having to go to the website to utilize it.
We were able to set up the initial communication between Twilio and Watson. It was very different setting up that controller and method,
to handle the continous post requests between the two services. Next, we had to find a way to maintain the state of the conversation
by capturing the content via Watson dialogue intents in the session. All the resources we could find were in Node.js and
we tried to set up that functionality within our Rails app. We ran into asset pipeline errors and environment setup. In a while,
we decided to try and build a separate Node.js app outside of our Rails environment. We set up two separate Node projects but
we were unable to connect everything in time.
This experience was a lot of fun. I was very intimidated at first, but once we strated writing code it was relatively easy
to implement documentation for the new technologies we were using.

We also had the final assessment during week 5 and that was stressful to manage our time. I worked really hard to prepare for the final
assessment, especially because I didn't do well in the midmod. I feel proud of what I was able to accomplish in 3 hours -- my
external API was fully functional, and I was able to consume the glassdoor API. I really wanted to experiment with BDD and DDD
and setup my app in that way. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to build my PORO in time. However, all of my code is tested and there are things I'd like to refactor
(especially making the zip/filter reusable), but I feel really great about my final assessment and for what I was able to learn
since the midmod.


| CATEGORY | Rales Engine | 80202 | Blake Street |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| **Functional/Client Expectations** | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| **TDD** | 2 | 3 | 3 |
| **Code Organization/Quality** | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| **API Design** | 3 | 3 | 3|
| **Queries** | 2 | 3 | 3|

> Rales Engine evaluation comments:
Ilana was pleased with the total outcome and with out AR queries. She felt we can improve by debugging further to resolve many
of the spec harness errors.

> Cloney Island Sprint 1 evaluation comments:
Client expectations were not met since my feature didn't deploy, however, I received feedback that that test and quality of the code is good.
It was nice to received feedback from the other team members and my overall score was above 3.

> Cloney Island Sprint 2 evaluation comments:
We received constructive criticism on how to approach brownfield projects without adding to exisisting tech debt and also to make
sure that not only our own code is tested.
Overall, the app looked and worked great. We added a lot of valuable features and our team worked well together. It was a very positive
experience.

## C. **Gear Ups**

I felt that gear ups were well organized and valueable this mod. I have separate gists for each one of the PD components.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* I've been a posse lead for 2 modules; I've met with mod 2 students to help; and I've been promoting the Turing community
everywhere I go. >

#### **Posse**
  >* I have been the posse lead for the last 2 modules and have really enjoyed fascilitating the process.
  >* I am proud that all posse members came to every meeting.
  >* We setup code wars account to practice coding concepts and we were able to have a mentor guest speak with us as well.
