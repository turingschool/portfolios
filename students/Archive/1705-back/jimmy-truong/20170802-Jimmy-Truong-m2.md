## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Bike-Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JoelLindow/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

(description)

(My goal was to complete the project with a better understanding of CRUD functionality. My role in the group was to build out the 'trips' model and analysis and parts of weather)

(This was an awesome project. I felt really good about it because I thought that our workflow was on point and we communicated well)

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jtruong2/brainBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

(The main idea behind this project was to create an app that lets users create, view, edit, and delete their ideas and admins can create categories and images that users attach to their ideas.)

(My goals were to understand how authorization and authentication works in applications)

(This was a great project. I really liked how I could build something that actually can be used by other users. I will keep working on this as a personal project.)

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jtruong2/little_shop)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

(With this project, we had to build out a full e-commerce site. A user will be able to login, logout, add things to cart, and checkout.)

(My goals going in were to build upon the foundations of authentication/ authorization, implement the cart order lifecycle, being able to work as a group and use waffle.io effectively. My roles here we're to contribute with building users, categories, carts, and orders. I was also able to get better at styling and really understand more html/css.)

(All-in-all, this project went very well. Our group commuincated through github and slack about issues and resolutions which made it very easy to work with eachother. )

-----------------------

## C: Final Assessments

(how did you do on written and timed independent?)
My written assesment, I received a 3 on comprehension and a 3 on technical communication. In my timed independent, I received a 3 all across the board.
(was this a representation of your best work?)
I felt like this was a strong effort on my part. There might be some things I need to pick up to get to a 4 but with all things considered, I have no doubt that I did do my best work.
