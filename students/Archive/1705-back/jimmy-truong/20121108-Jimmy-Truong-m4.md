Land a JOB

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

PASS

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

  Communicating terms I'm not familiar with

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

  I liked how I was able to get a feel of what communication is like in an interview

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

  One of the more difficult tasks for me was to describe a term that I'm not too familiar with. I went about saying that I don't know but I can give an educated guess. 

* What did you learn?

  I learned that the approach I took in admitting that I don't know gave me a sign of relief and made me feel like I'm not trying to B.S the answer.


## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

  I worked on the foods portion of the project and the most difficult part was to tackle the re-rendering edits and deletes.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

  After extensive research and finding nothing that helped, I asked a classmate to help me handle the problem.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

  Being able to pair with another person, I was able to learn from my mistakes and see where I went wrong.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

  -How to use event listeners
  
  -Refactoring code down to different files/folders
  
  -How to make an ajax call to the backend

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

  One thing I'd change is keep track of how long it's taking me to solve the problem on my own. I'd like to start asking for help after a certain period of time after trying to solve it solo.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

  It was great. I was fortunate enough to have a partner that was very communicative and organized.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

  The biggest challenge was learning React Native to start off my project.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

  I did a ton of tutorials on react native and asked Dan Alvarez from 1705FE to help me grasp some of the concepts

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

  I really liked how I was able to program something that can be deployed on my iphone.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

  -This project really solidified the concept 'Data Down, Action Up'. I finally know what that means.
  
  -I learned how to make fetch calls to my backend to authenticate and retrieve data
  
  -I learned how React Native works as a whole ( holding states, async actions, etc.)

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

The biggest feedback I received was from my mentor. He told me to stay positive and keep moving. Ever since, I've been keeping the momentum up and doing the most I can.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

  It was a great experience working to plan this gear up. I was able to share my experiences and faults through out Turing. The most satisfying thing was when I talked to the class on my approches of cold outreach and being able to see the engagement in their faces.


## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

I volunteered at RMR and also sat down and talked with the younger mods to give them some guidance.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

-How to learn tech

-Ways of speaking more technical

-How to network
