-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
>* \<Description> APIcurious is an app that consumes the github service and lets users login using github and displays information on the user.
https://github.com/jtruong2/apicurious
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
I really enjoyed this project because it really taught me how oauth and services work.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* \<Description> This project is a sales engine api that can be used to display json info such as merchants, customers, and transactions.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
This was my favorite project out of MOD3 because I struggled the most on it. I'm so glad I was able to completely finish this project with spec harness and simplecov passing at 100%.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://)**
>* \<Description> This app is an "Airbnb" for disaster victims. Users can be victims, hosts, or an admin.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
This was the first 5 person group project and it was quite difficult. I saw the value in using Agile and project management tools.
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://)**
>* \<Description> Trail up is an app that lets users create and search for events at hiking trails.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
It was difficult working through a project that built by someone else. Definitely a good experience because I was able to see some great code that I can implement in my own project.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
\<3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently for each gear up>
(https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown

My main takeaway from the reading in this gear up is that microaggressions can lead to bigger things such as stereotypes. and making people feel out of place.

https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/groupthink.md
I was not here for group think gear up.

I attended the gear up "Privacy" and found it really interesting because I never new how much data was being collected from an everyday life. I got to thinking where the line is for collecting too much data.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* \<Link &/or blurb about the option you chose (blog post, lead a spike or posse, lightning talk, open source contribution or pair > 3 times)>
I'm working on writing up a tutorial currently on the steps to take from development to production(setup, development, CI, Staging, Production).

#### **Posse**
  >* \<Blurb about what you did with your posse over the module>
  We played games as a team builder and had a mentor Q&A
  >* \<Your favorite thing about the posse experience>
