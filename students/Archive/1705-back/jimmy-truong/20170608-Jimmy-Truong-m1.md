## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
My goal for this module was to have a complete understanding of Ruby and how to implement it.

## Rubric Scores

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### (Date Night)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jtruong2/date_night)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/date_night)

The objective of this project was to build a binary search tree data structure to store large sets of data. A functioning project for this specific tree
was to be able to store a list of movies along with their scores, then being able to search for them.

(evaluation comments)

-20 tests all passing
-remember to use lib and test directories in future
-some opportunties to refactor
-completed to include

#### (Battleship)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jtruong2/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

The objective of this project was to build a REPL based on the game Battleship. In this project
we had to implement code to create a functioning AI to play against along with greetings, placement
configurations, and statistics.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects


#### (Complete Me)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MikelSage/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/complete_me)

In this group project, Michael and I collaborated to build a data structure known as trie. The Idea behind this project is to create a trie structure and load the entire english dictionary, later then being able to search using a substring and getting all possible matches to that substring. In our project we made our search even smarter by adding weight to words, meaning when a user selects a word from the return, it adds weight and sorts the words the next time they search for the word. We also implemented an extension for the project which was to build a GUI for our project.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Growth Mindset)

* [GitHub URL]()

This gear up gave me a new perspective on how your attitude determines your performance. After our session, I try go into every challenge with a positive mind and attitude. It has definitely helped play to my mood.

#### (Getting better at difficult things)

* [GitHub URL]()

This gear up especially stood out to me. I found it interesting how cognitive resources work. After this session, I started working on ways to preserve my cognitive resources such as preparing my lunch before going to bed and parking further instead of trying to find a close parking space.

#### (Developing your story)

* [GitHub URL]()

This session I was able to reflect on myself and see where I've started to where I am today. I really enjoyed hearing other's past and what their favorite story's are. This has got me thinking where my future will lead me here at Turing and after.

#### (Intro/Extro/Ambi)

* [GitHub URL]()

I never really considered myself an any kind of vert until coming into this session. Talking with others, I found myself to be an ambivert. I didn't really know the exact definitions of intro/extro vert so this has helped me understand not only the meaning but it helped me understand others.

#### (Code: Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL]()

I absolutely enjoyed watching this video. It gave me great insight on the challenges that females have to overcome in industries like software engineering. I thought we live in a time where things like being discriminated were behind us. My takeaway from this is that if we welcome a more diverse group into the world of programming, we would solve so many problems in todays world.

#### (Universal Basic Income)

* [GitHub URL]()

Universal Basic income has got me thinking about automation and how jobs will be left to machines. I believe it's inevitable. I am pro UBI just because it's the only option that I see viable for this inevitability.



## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
I try to help clean mess where I see them. I'm very particular when it comes to having clean work areas. Also, when I come in early in the morning, I try to make coffee for others.
