-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)
I failed the end of module assessment because didn't have my core concepts down.


## B: Individual Work & Projects
Credit Check, Jungle Beat, Battleship

(Intro)
working on a project alone was a good challenge struggled a lot getting the format of the code.

#### (Jungle Beats)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NateGiesing/Jungle_beat)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat)

(description)
Jungle Beats was about nods and making then transfer data to other nodes
(evaluation comments)
Working through iter 1 with prepend working, but append not working for multiple nodes
14 tests, all passing

(Intro)
Was a fun project but hit a lot of walls trying to figure it out.

#### (Battleship)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/tree/master/1705-b/1module/battleship/nate-giesing)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

(description)
Battleship was a hard project to work alone but learned a lot of file.io and a lot about hashes
(evaluation comments)
7 all passing
Working toward breaking things down into smaller methods
Areas for refactoring and pulling functionality out for methods
Used multiple classes that made sense, still working on tying pieces together
REPL prints welcome message, but nothing beyond that



## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
Night Writer, Black Thursday (Paired)
(Intro)
I learned a lot on this project with Joel showed me so much and the breakthroughs we had we awesome and had a lot
of good ideas.
#### (Night Writer)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JoelLindow/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer)

(description)
Was cool translating the braille to english and seeing such a simple concepts turn into something challenging
(evaluation comments)
working plus extension
18 tests
Runner files contain too much logic
Depends on instance variables to share information - think of methods as sending and receiving messages
File IO should be pulled out


(feedback to me)

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)
Good just to round off all your skills and to know what to do in job interviews
### Gear Up
Growth Mind set, Personal Story, M4 Student
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL]()

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

Growth Mind Set made me think of how I put myself in a box and stopping myself from learning new things. Helped with keeping an open mind on what I can and can't do. Pushes me to think am I thinking in an open mind set.

Personal Story was really fun hearing other peoples story's. Hearing from people on why they wanted to come to Turing was really interesting to hear that their story even through it was different it had the same reason why for me. People are sick of the jobs and they are wanting a career and to have a skill that never really goes away.

Mod4 Students was a really fun gear up that had us think about how robots are taking jobs and what would happen with that.
Was really cool to see how other people think about this and how they would go and fix it. Just shows how minds can be learning the same thing but also think so different from each other but still come up with the same problems or different solutions to those problems.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)

I have cleaned some dishes in the sink to help out with dishes. I haven't really done much for the Turing community to be honest.
