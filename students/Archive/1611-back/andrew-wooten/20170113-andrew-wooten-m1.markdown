 Andrew Wooten - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
I came into this module as prepared as I thought I could be.  In progressing through this module
my goal was to gain a working knowledge and understanding of the concepts we are covering. I am
not presently seeking mastery, rather I've worked towards being in a place of technical knowledge
where I can find answers with reasonable ease and have to do so with a minimum frequency.  I feel
that I'm on approach to this goal, but at the same time a decent distance away.  I'm happy with the
progress I've made; however, there is always room for additional improvement and good habit-building.

In terms of the greater Turing mission, I worked hard to get settled in the Turing community.
I've sought to be a good team member to my fellow Module 1 students as well as communicate feedback
effectively.  I've done my best to play ball with everyone and give everyone everything I've got in
terms of support.  I feel like I've adapted very well to the community aspect at Turing.  I, unfortunately,
did not manage my time well enough to work on starting a posse.  It's something I remain interested in
and hope to pursue in mod2.

4. Breaking Logic into Components
  2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility
   are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility

(feedback to me)
I really enjoyed working with you. You are a great communicator and you really helped get our
project get going. You were always kind, supportive and helpful. I think that our partnership
went really well and that we both tried our best to help the project move along at a steady pace.
During our project I felt like I was learning new things each day. I didn’t do most of the typing
but I do not feel like this took away from my learning. We were both there checking in on each other
and making sure we were on the same page. My advice to you is next time you are working with someone
I would make sure that you trade off doing the driving because you may not be paired with someone
who actually is on the same page. I think we are a great team and I am glad I got a chance to work with you.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
GearUp Reflection: 12/2/16

Growth Mindset: Carol Dweck “The Power of Believing”.

	I enjoyed my first GearUp.  It was a good change from class time, and I was pleased to get exposed
	to personal development content.  I’d actually heard the TED talk by Carol Dweck before, but I hadn’t
	given it much thought or application to how I approached my life.  At the time, I was committed to a
	career, and I wasn’t in a mindset where I could see that my own fairly fixed mindset was causing harm
	to my life. Fast-forwarding to where I’m at in life presently, and I can definitely see how applicable
	a growth mindset is to not just professional success but personal also. I grew up in fairly competitive
	and pressured school environment; it was never unloving; however, there were high expectations set for
	grades/school/behavior/etc.  A ‘B’ was frowned upon.  I ended up carrying that mindset with me after
	high school, through college, and into my first career path.  While it gave me drive to succeed, it also
	had the unfortunate side effect of a myriad of negative feelings when I didn’t live up to my own fairly
	high expectations.  It hampered my ability to see progress I’d made in making it to a goal, and while I
	could power through it, it was at the expense of my own happiness.  It led me to a life where meeting
	goals was all that really mattered regardless of how I felt.  At second pass, the growth mindset content
	meant a lot more to me at this point in my life; sometimes you have to be in a certain place for something
	to make sense I suppose.  I’ve found it’s application immediately helpful, and it’s among my focuses for
	school to maintain a growth mindset.  Looking back at the first week made me feel really good about life.
	My growth mindset helped me focus on how much I’d already learned and accomplished rather than what I’d
	failed at throughout my time thus far.  It was very liberating, and I much prefer thinking that way to
	constantly having my attention on my failures and areas for progress. I enjoyed the group talks we had
	following the presentation.  I felt comfortable opening up, if only slightly, and was delighted to find
	that I wasn’t alone in how I felt about something, particularly in what caused me to slide into a fixed
	mindset.  The dialogue that took place within my group was immensely enjoyable.  It was productive and
	an excellent use of our time at Turing; I enjoyed getting to know my group members more closely. Overall,
	I was delighted at the content and surrounding experiences of my first GearUp.  I zealously look forward
	to the next.  

GearUp Reflection 12/16/16

Introversion/Extroversion Spectrum

	 I'm an introvert.  I guess my biggest takeway from this GearUp was that I'm not alone, a feeling most introverts
	 are familiar with I imagine, in that.  It hasn't been difficult for me to pinpoint myself on that spectrum over
	 the course of my life to this point.  I'm looking at the prompt questions: "What actions do you want to take for
	 yourself and your cohort to be successful?", "How can you leverage your place on the spectrum of introversion/extroversion
	 to impact your career?".  I think those are good questions, but I think ultimately the lesson should be in regards
	 to adaptability regardless of circumstance.  I say that because regardless of my position on the spectrum, my height,
	 hair color,(insert more arbitrary qualities) the world will continue to move forward.  Can a realistically expect for
	 an employer to adapt an entire working environment to me based on that fact that I fall pretty far left on that spectrum?
	 I cannot, therefore I must adapt.

	 I don't think of my introversion as a strength or a weakness, just a state of being which is, depending on situation,
	 a hindrance and an asset. I think the responsibility falls on the individual to know oneself intimately enough to
	 safely navigate situations that the world puts before them. As a function of my introversion, there is certainly a
	 list of needs that need to be met in order to self-maintain: alone time to recharge, routine, exercise, safe interaction
	 with people, and even occasional deviations from all the above.  Some of those may be individual to me, but I'm aware of
	 them because they're my needs that I meet.  I know them forwards and backwards, and I can tell you based on how I am
	 feeling which one has gone unmet.  I would submit that in taking care of myself that I'm self-enabling to put out the
	 best of me into the world, workplace, school, whathaveyou.

	 It sounds simple doesn't it?  Make a list, check items off the list, and everything is okay.  I submit that the best
	 any person can do is to arrange ones life such that their baseline needs are seen to.  From there, engage a constant
	 battle to push the envelope farther and harder lest they end up sendentary, which isn't a good thing for anyone. If you
	 first master yourself, then you are best equipped to affect whatever change you see fit in the world.  I learned not that
	 much during GearUp; that's not to degrade the content, which was excellent.  It was a good reminder to remain self-
	 conscious in the best way possible.  My largest takeaway was growing closer to my fellow 1611 backenders.  I was happy to
	 sit in my small group and share experiences, challenges faced, and solutions come to.  I was thankful for that time.

GearUp Reflection 1/6/16

	I've enjoyed, in particular, the mindset GearUps.  The Grit session was no different.  In doing some self-examination
	after the fact, I realized that there are a lot of times when I 'grit' too much, and it's damaging.  While there are
	absolutely times in ones life when they must do the 'grin and bear it', engaging in this behavior on too regular a
	basis can leave a person exhausted, burnt out, and isolated.  Ilana actually gave helpful advice some time ago in this
	department.  She cited that she doesn't do any good work past 9PM.  In practice, I found that I roughly have the same
	working parameters.  Before getting this advice, I did my best to grit through to the point of exhaustion.  I've found
	that in dialing back my grit slightly that my work, workflow, and general level of happiness have improved.  This GearUp
	helped to reinforce that there is an important balance between pushing through and knowing when to stop for your own sake.  


### Professional Development Workshops

Personal Branding I 11/29/16

	I thought that this was a pretty interesting session.  I was happy to see how seriously Turing takes preparing its
	students for the job search and the professional world.  Overall, I was pleased with the content and to be challenged to
	begin develop a personal brand that will serve me well in the software world. It caught me off guard how much there would
	be to put together.  I suppose I never realized how much was out there.  I've assembled a LinkedIn page as well as an updated
	resume.  I'm fairly happy with both; although, they both need work.  I'm pretty pleased with the feedback I
	received from my peers regarding what I put together.  I've updated both deliverables based on the feedback and look forward
	more professional development education in the future.

Resume
https://resume.creddle.io/review/63m784ftb22


Personal Branding II 1/12/16

	I didn't take too much away from this session.  I thought that the content, while entirely necessary, was pretty simplistic.
	It boiled down, essentially, to presenting yourself as you'd like to be seen.  This applies to resume, social media, web page,
	etc.  The greatest takeway that I had from this session was the 'how?' to do all of this.  I greatly appreciated the time
	taken to break down, what can absolutely be, a daunting task into fairly simple steps to iterate through.  I was delighted to have
	an outline from which to build from.




## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback
Maria Stenquist
	Maria has been an excellent community member to me throughout the program.  She has been awesome, serving as a sounding
	board for not only technical problems but also personal stress related to the program. She always maintains a open,
	nonjudgmental attitude and has always contributed meaningful content to any conversation that we have; also, she showed
	a great deal of respect to me when a conversation was going a direction I was uncomfortable with.  She played a large part
	in our cohort remaining cohesive, engaging equally with each member throughout module 1.  Our conversations kept me afloat
	on several bad days throughout the program.  Maria is a stellar example of the behaviors Turing community member should
	exhibit, and I was fortunate that we shared a cohort.  Keep being awesome!

Ken Lee
	I am continually impressed with Kens drive to learn.  I’m sincere when I say that there are few in our cohort who have
	exhibited the grit and growth mindset that Ken has. On a near daily basis since the start of our cohort, I have watched Ken
	plug through almost every drill imaginable and, with an incredible amount of grace, admit openly that he was struggling to
	gain an understanding of the material.  I am honored that he reached out to me several times in the past several weeks for
	help.  He was a pleasure to work through things with and at no time exhibited self-pity, whining, or any other negative
	behavior that one general associates with someone in duress; rather, he always kept about him an attitude of knowledge-seeking and odd glee when faced with problems.  He forced me to grow my own knowledge in making, at times, haphazard attempts to explain things, and I’m thankful for the time I got to spend with working with Ken.  	
	I’m always impressed with the ease with which Ken interacts with people.  He is seemingly continually engaged in dialogue
	with some member of our cohort.  He is quick to compliment someones work and always keeps those around him in good cheer
	with jokes.  I’m happy that we were both a part of 1611.  His presence and our interactions single-handedly made the past
	6 weeks better.  Don’t change at all Ken.  You’re a rock star!


Spencer Carter
	There is nobody in our cohort who has made me laugh more than Spencer.  In the first weeks when our cohort was finding it’s
	groove and people were still feeling each other out, there was Spencer readily making jokes and helping bring us together.  
	He played a large part in developing and maintaining our group cohesiveness.  He’s made it clear through his behavior that
	his mindset is one of equality.  No person is greater or less than another.  He happily welcomes engagement with anyone he
	comes into contact with.  I’ve not made the opportunity to work with Spencer on technical problems; however, he is a continual
	shining example of how people should treat each other.  The Turing community prides itself on such behavior, and our community
	at-large and the 1611 cohort benefit from having him as a member.  Spencer, if your personality and how you treat people never
	changes, that would be a great thing.

### Being a Community Member
Maria Stenquist
Andy has been a great resource in the class for me to go to. He is always willing to lend an ear and listen to any topic (personal,
code-related, off-topic and fun) and is definitely the 'go-to' listener in the class. He listens without judgement and provides
constructive comments to the conversation. Moreover, he is so polite and respectful to everyone in the class, and when I was having
a rough moment, he had the wherewithal to take a step back--but he didn't forget and made sure to reach out to me at a later point
which showed a great deal of empathy--and that awareness extends to all others' in the cohort.  In addition to being a great team-player
in the class, he is always willing to help others with understanding code concepts, and I have seen him dedicate a lot of time to
helping others (including myself). Keep being such a supportive Turing member, and I look forward to all the cool app ideas coming
to fruition! I look forward to showing you around some pretty epic spots up in the high country of Colorado 😃

Ken Lee
Andy, I have enjoyed getting to know you in our cohort and seeing how much you are learning so far. You have always been so positive
and reminding me that everything is okay. I appreciate all your help you have giving me working on drills. You were always positive
and patiently leading me in the right direction letting me solve problems myself. Your cool head and enthusiasm at solving complex
problems is something I want to learn from. Your approach of writing down on paper where the data goes has been influential to my
learning processes and I plan to use that method more on my projects. I see you making a big impact on any team you wind up working
for. You are the exact type of developer that companies I've worked for look for in a new hire. A great culture fit and abilities
to learn complex ideas and solve them in a calm and fun attitude will definitely get you going places.

Spencer Carter
From the first day at Turing, Andy’s positive attitude has rubbed off on all those lucky enough to have come into contact with him.
Always the first one to class, he would show up prepared, determined, and genuinely excited about the forthcoming material. His
upbeat demeanor was truly contagious and frequently kept many members of the Turing community alive during periods of exhaustion
late in the evening. On a daily basis, I watched him exemplify his passion for the field, always willing to lend a helping hand to
those who needed it. Even when he appeared to have exerted the remainder of his energy, he would look over his peers’ code with a
fresh pair of eyes. His drive, work ethic, optimism, and passion led him to improve with every project he completed, and in upcoming
modules I believe that we will only continue to see Andy excel as a coder. Andy, you truly challenged every one of us to be the best
version of ourselves on a daily basis– thank you.

### Playing a Part

I played a meaningful roll in 1611-BE-M1, and I look forward to growing outward from where I am in the Turing community.  I'm
still eager to start a posse to discuss ethics/morality and technology, and it's a goal that will be realized.  I was delighted
with the interactions I had with the Turing community.  In the future, I would like to engage more with the Turing community as a
whole.  I think that this could be best accomplished with some outreach, co-ordination of, and attendance of events.  I regret that I was not more active with the the community at large, and it is something that I will improve in.
