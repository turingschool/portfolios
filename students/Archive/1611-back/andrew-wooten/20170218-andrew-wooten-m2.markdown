## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

    This module was pretty important to me. I set healthy list
  of goals to accomplish this module. In addition to
  gaining competency with the coursework[kind of a given], I
  set out to develop personally in a number of areas. My
  involvement in the community was my primary(without
  consideration to Mod 2 coursework) area for improvement
  this inning.
    My community involvement was fairly limited in Mod 1.
  New place, new people, all of that. I didn't participate
  in a posse and wasn't particularly engaged, my feelings, in
  the community. I identified that as a weakness in my
  reflections on Mod 1. To start on correcting it, I joined a
  posse this module, Hamilton. I'm sad that we didn't deliver
  anything to the community this inning; however, socially I
  was happy with the progress I made there in reaching out to
  play a larger part in the community. I'm going to push for
  more next inning.
    I was very excited about pairing with Mod 1 students this
  time around. My pairings in Mod 1 were extremely helpful to
  me, and I wanted to impart the same good things to this round
  of Mod 1 students. I took steps to build some bridges; this
  mainly consisted of walking next door to check in and, in general,
  just being friendly. I also, excitedly, filled out my pairing
  availability for duration of the inning when the form was made
  available. I'm fortunate in that I've had the opportunity to
  pair with several students. It was a worrisome experience
  pairing with them; however, I believe that the pairing sessions
  went fairly well. They may not have gotten the answers to all
  of their questions, but I'm hopeful that they walked away with
  some good ideas and tools technically in addition to decent
  ways to go about finding answers. They were extremely rewarding
  experiences, and it's a habit I plan to continue in the future.
    I've done my best to support my cohort this inning; I would
  qualify this as the most basic part of being a community member.
  I don't believe that this is embodied in just showing up to class
  and answering the survey questions on a weekly basis. Positivity,
  in my experience, is fairly contagious. I'm general a pretty
  chipper person, so I let this out more, in a verbal sense. It
  was actually taken note of in some of my feedback from Bikeshare
  as an attribute which was helpful in driving the group forward.
  Some informal verbal feedback from classmates has yielded similar
  feedback, so I'm calling that a decent victory. Thanks, in part,
  I think to my efforts to be more vocal and morale-boosting,
  I was returned the happy opportunity to help classmates with
  problems on a pretty regular basis throughout the module. While
  I didn't always have the best help for problems, it felt like my
  community engaged me more, and I was grateful to be trusted as
  a resource for help.
    I hadn't planned on it, but there was also an opportunity to
  host a Friday Spike session. I was hesitant but went through
  with it. I didn't deliver anything technical; I focused on a
  topic pertinent to students' development that I was comfortable
  with: communication and feedback. I was slightly disappointed
  when only 3 people came to my session; however, it turned out to
  be an excellent time. Rather than the straight lecture and
  exercises I had planned it turned into me talking about some content
  for a bit and then the 4 of us round-tabling it. Ideas were added
  and taken away; experiences and thoughts were shared.
  It was a terrific session, and I'm glad I took part in it.
    Overall, I'm content with the progress I made in playing a role
  as a community member.  There's always more I can do, and I'm going
  to push myself for progress in the areas of the posse next module
  as well as making a larger impact on the Module 1 students.

## B: Individual Work & Projects


Mix Master

https://github.com/andrewdwooten/mix_master

http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mix_master/1_getting_started

Mix Master is a rails app which allows users to create playlists
of songs which also have an associated artist.

Takeaways:
  I enjoyed the Mix Master project.  The best thing I walked away
with was a greater familiarity with RSpec, Capybara, and feature testing.
The repetition of going through the tasks was great. I was thankful to
have examples of good test-building practices. This, and how the
tutorial was constructed, really hammered home how great TDD is when it
is applied appropriately. This process helped me gain not only a familiarity
with RSpec but also greatly reinforced and added to my knowledge of how
Rails and the MVC ?model? really functions. I've carried this process
forward, and it has greatly benefited my understanding the work I'm doing
as well as my finished products.

Rails Mini Project

https://github.com/andrewdwooten/mini-project

http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project

I chose PointBox for my Rails Mini Project. It is a rails application
that allows a person to register for an account and redeem points
assigned by an admin for robot trading cards.

Takeaways
  I took away from PointBox an increased understanding of user roles
and authentication. It was an extremely grey topic area for me that
I didn't fully understand. I was thankful for the opportunity to
work through another implementation of it.  PointBox cleared up a lot
for me in that area. I also became more comfortable with designing my
own database tables. This wasn't really a grey area for me insomuch as
it was a place where I had to work through my own ideas and turn it into
functioning code. I also took the opportunity to experiment with using
Materialize for my views.  It's not my favorite to work with
at this point, but I was happy to deal with it and gain experience.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects


* BikeShare

https://github.com/ande1618/bike_share

https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share

BikeShare is a Sinatra app which consumes publicly available data
from CSV files regarding bike share trends; it analyzes the data
to draw trends and display it for the user.

Evaluation Comments(Andrew Carmer):

Naming of routes is odd. '/stations/index'
Would like the group to be more prepared for next checking
UX is a little funky on some pages.
Some broken pages. Updates, trip index, new station
The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

Evaluation Scores:

  Functional Expectations:

    2: Application has some small missing base functionality

  ActiveRecord:

    3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but
       some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project
       at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct
       results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query
       was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor
      misunderstanding.

  User Experience and Conventions:

    3: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience
       is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready
       to be deployed to production for a client.

  Code Organization/Quality

    3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/responses remains in
       the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow
       unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

  Testing:

    3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and
       integration/feature tests

  Working Collaboratively


    3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

Feedback to me:
  From Spencer Carter:

    I want to thank you for being the fearless leader of the "DreamTeam" for
   Bikeshare! I was excited to work with you, and you did not disappoint. Not
   only are you becoming an exceptional developer but the way in which you
   approached problems was true "growth mindset." There never was there an
   ounce of doubt from you, it was merely a matter of when it would be solved.
   The area that you should focus on is grit, in a "the enemy of good, is
   better" type of way. ( I was right next to you for this part, I need to work
   on it too) Pretty much the "code freeze" that Carmer discussed with
   us, would have benefited our health and our presentation. You had an extra
   layer of responsibility being our "project manager," you did an excellent
   job not being bossy or letting the power go to your head. We heard cohort
   mates talk about how our group envied. This is largely due to you and your
   efforts as Project Manager. Andy I enjoyed working with you and cannot wait
   for the opportunity to work together again!

  From Jonathan Serrano:

      Thanks for always checking in throughout the day on how, myself and the
    rest of the team, were doing not only on the project itself but on a state
    of mind. It gave peace of mind in knowing that there was that team
    chemistry. I admire your grit that you showed all throughout the project,
    you were always on deck with creating, styling, testing, tying up
    lose ends etc. Watching you create a method that would solve our, not being
    able to create a station, at last hour was way beyond my scope and you
    staying all night to finish the project is the definition of grit. While I
    value your efforts in getting it done, it can become an issue if it becomes
    a regular occurrence. I would not like to see you burn yourself out as you
    are one of the brightest individuals that I've had the pleasure of working
    with. Thanks for being a helpful, well-rounded and informative partner.

  From James Anderson:

      You did a great job anchoring the group. You were very good about reaching
    out to others outside the group for advice and getting us over hurdles that
    held us up for hours (i.e. trip data). In the future, make sure to give
    your team very clear updates about any monumental changes or progress
    you've made. Also, take others' working/personality styles into account.
    Some people need to work in silence on occasion or completely unplug from
    project related conversation for a breather. Your overwhelming positivity
    is a force to be reckoned with and your courteousness is refreshing. You
    are always ready and willing to add a helping hand. I think we all meshed
    really well and I'm very proud of the headway that the four of us made
    in skill level and the work we produced. Looking forward to the next time
    we get paired together.

* Little Shop of Orders

  https://github.com/codyborders/abandoned_camel_coffee_mercantile

  https://fathomless-wave-15993.herokuapp.com/

  http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop

  The Abandoned Camel Coffee Mercantile is a Rails E-commerce site. It
  is backed by a Postgres database which holds tables for orders, users,
  items, categories, and item_categories. The app utilizes bcrypt for
  user authentication and also applies roles to users such that an admin
  role is present. The views were constructed with Bootstrap, and the app was
  tested with RSpec. It was deployed to Heroku(see above link).


## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up

* Tragedy of the Commons
  https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown

    Reflection:
      In any conversation among like individuals, you are likely to never have
    your ideas challenged. You won't be forced to validate it. You won't be
    exposed to any new ideas or concepts. I can only speak for myself, but
    that's lame. That's beyond lame. It's the most boring, mundane world
    I could imagine. Diversity is a great thing. It exposes a person to
    concepts, experiences, and ideas that they otherwise would not have
    even known existed. A lack of diversity is the culinary equivalent of
    only ever eating plain hamburgers and vanilla ice cream your whole life.
    Nuts to that!
      I come from a background of emergency medicine serving a number of
    populations in a large city. While I left that career for many reasons,
    I'm thankful for the opportunity I had to interact with so many people.
    They came from all over the world and shared all sorts of stories and
    experiences with me that you couldn't even imagine. They left an impression
    on me that I hope I never forget. My experiences and value of of having
    people from different backgrounds in my life are a part of the reason I
    chose to come to Turing.
      How does this apply to Turing or to a workplace? Diversity "quotas" were
    were brought up as a point of discussion in our small group(me and two
    other white guys talking about diversity; great conversation but would have
    loved some other input). It seems that in describing diversity organizations
    have a tendency to call in a percentage, ratio, or some metric measurement.
    While, yes, that is a component, albeit a slightly offensive one when you
    start thinking about how you're just sorting people into neat little
    Title IX boxes, there's more to diversity than just metrics. Diversity, to
    me, is a hodgepodge of people from a variety of backgrounds treating each
    other as equals regardless of differences or position.
      Utilizing a quota and getting people in the door is the easy part. I'm
    not going to address any moral or ethical concerns of using a quota; there
    have likely been doctoral theses written on the subject. The hard part is
    getting a person to just see another person. Not someone who is a different
    color, gender, sexual orientation, or what-have-you but just another
    individual person with ideas, thoughts, likely some funny stories, and
    hopefully some amazing recipes.
      This is a change that must happen on the individual level. No amount of
    workplace goals or mission statements or quotas can make this happen. The
    best any organization can do is facilitate opportunities for an individual
    to break out of a sorting/classifying mindset and into a different one.
    Turing does a good job of this in exposing us to various content through
    our Gear Up sessions which is a great asset, particularly where the
    small group discussions are integrated, and I'm proud of us for that.
      I have trouble understanding how the other side thinks(those who draw
    immediate impressions based on someones appearance). This session
    helped me see, in a statistical kind of way, how the problem is perceived.
    Society is a long way(at best decades) from being able to see past
    appearance. Until we can raise a generation with this mindset, quotas,
    cool Gear Up sessions, and small group discussions are the best that can
    be done. That and swapping good recipes; everyone eats right?

* Debugging the Gender Gap
  https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown

    Reflection:
      The move was enjoyable although slightly redundant at times. It got its
    overall theme and point across effectively. As a frame of reference, I
    took the theme to be something like, "There is a deficit of women in the
    Computer Science field; this is a problem that needs to be addressed."
      I agree that the shortage of women in the CS field is concerning. The
    jobs are plentiful; the pay is good, and it's a meaningful career path, so
    given those facts why does such a deficit exist? I appreciate that the film
    had something like a 90 minute run time and could not remotely expect to
    answer all of the questions it raised. As with most problems in society,
    the status of public education in the country came into play. I've long-
    attributed a lot of problems to where education is at. It certainly plays
    a significant role in this problem: a lack of CS resources, a lack of
    funding, etc. Education in our country needs a drastic overhaul to improve
    many things, the gender gap in CS among them.
      The film established the existence of the gender gap in CS(fairly obvious
    to anyone looking) well. It failed to answer an overarching question I still
    have: "If not CS, then what career paths are women choosing?" The film cited
    pretty clearly that women represent the majority of successful individuals
    in undergraduate programs. If I'm not mistaken, the statistics have been
    that way for some time. I suspect that the reason for the gender gap in
    the STEM fields likely comes from a mix of a few things, societal pressure
    coupled with bad experiences in STEM-related courses. This isn't an
    awareness issue, rather I highly doubt it. It's fairly common knowledge
    that the careers STEM fields, CS particularly, are both lucrative and
    enjoyable. I'd be interested to see a study among current female
    undergraduate students, particularly those who are committed to a major
    outside of a STEM field, that asks why they chose it over CS/STEM. That
    would probably help get pointed to a root(probably more than one here)
    problem that could be addressed.
      The US is experiencing a crisis of culture in a number of areas: gender
    roles, sexuality, race relations, etc. In particular to the gender roles,
    we're at a point where draconian rules no longer apply. You can truly do
    whatever you'd like with your life; the opportunities exist if you're
    passionate and willing to pursue them. The good news and the reason I'm
    optimistic about the gender gap is that we're at an interesting point in
    time. A generation at, stereotypically, supports the draconian rules of
    old are teetering out of various positions of authority where they're in a
    position to negatively impact young women with flawed ideology. While
    there are idiots in every generation I suspect, the closing of the gender
    gap in STEM careers can be on the horizon if appropriate actions are taken
    and a few key pieces are put in place.
      I enjoyed the film. It gave me some interesting thoughts to tinker
    around with. I'm looking forward to seeing what the future holds for the
    gender gap. I'm hopeful that it will close with a fair amount of rapidity
    in my lifetime.

* Universal Basic Income
  https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown

    Reflection:
      I thought this was an interesting topic to bring up. I was remiss that
    my cohort was not party to the Automation Gear Up as that would have
    given a little better frame with which to examine the idea. The content of
    the articles was thought-provoking, and our group conversation was one of
    the best I've had surrounding a Gear Up. Our group came to three
    determinations overall.
      1) Job retraining for workers displaced by automation is a priority. This
    seems like common sense. You're 40 and jobless with a very specific set of
    skills that come from the manufacturing world(or any other niche affected
    industry). There would have to be a program in place in order to see that
    you can re-enter the labor force as quickly as possible. UBI is a neat
    prospect, but the implementation would have to be backed by such a program
    that gave the populations affected by automation a way to get back to work.
      2) Awareness of UBI needs to be raised. Nobody in our group had heard the
    term 'UBI'.  We were familiar with it in concept. I agree with Elon Musk
    that UBI is likely a forgone conclusion. With that, it's pretty well
    understood the rate at which government programs are established and
    implemented. If it is going to have a chance at being successful in time
    to catch up with the problem of technology displacing workers then the
    raising of awareness needs to get rolling ASAP even if just to explore
    the idea further and later have it found to be inviable.
      3) A test implementation of UBI needs to be conducted and studied
    with a forensic amount of detail. Lots of ideas sound great on paper, and
    the data may appear to back it, but you won't find a lot of the bugs in
    a program of any kind until you take it to production. A test, preferably
    well-publicized, in a large city would be a tremendous benefit to exploring
    the benefits and unanticipated problems of UBI. It would give us the
    opportunity to examine it closely and find out if it's the best direction
    to go.
      Overall, I was thankful for the exposure to the concept. It was great
    to get to interact with students from other Mods for Gear Up, and I'm
    hopeful we'll continue that in the future. Our conversation was thought-
    provoking, and I intend on doing some more research into UBI and similar
    programs.

### Professional Development Workshops

  * Collaborative Communication
    https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/collaborative_communication.md

      Deliverable:
        Reflection on project management strategies you used in your team
        projects; What went well? What didn’t go well?

          I was fortunate to be assigned as project manager for our Bikeshare
        project this inning. It was great experience; albeit, I was pretty
        stressed going into the project with some sense of additional
        responsibility.  I'm going to direct this reflection more towards
        the strategies I implemented in leading the team and less towards
        any technical tools like Waffle or GitHub strategies.
          I firmly believe that people are put in a position to do their best
        work when they're interested in it and believe it has value. To
        work with this, I made it a point to do stand-ups and personal
        check-ins at frequent intervals throughout the project. It worked
        out pretty well. My teammates verbalized readily the parts of the
        project that they wanted to work on, and in the end everyone had
        contributed to each avenue of the project. The team was happy with
        that; everyone took the opportunity to learn from the project as
        much as they could
          The personal check-ins worked out fairly well. I know the stress
        that comes with facing a problem when you're on a timer. It can
        destroy you if you let it. The check-ins allowed time to vent about
        frustrating problems and also encouraged collaboration within the
        team even when a member was working independently. It was gratifying
        to be leading a team with members who grew increasingly more cohesive
        as the project progressed.
          I don't know that it necessarily qualifies as a strategy; however,
        negativity has a tendency to drag down group productivity or, at the
        very least, makes the work somewhat miserable and less satisfying.
        Inexperienced leaders, or just bad ones, in my experience have a
        tendency to try and just squash negativity through authority or
        browbeating.  Leading by example in this area is a tremendous asset
        which will assist in a pleasant group experience. My group remarked
        about my positivity and even mentioned that it helped keep them
        going at times in the face of seemingly insurmountable problems.
        I did my best to continually encourage each team member individually,
        during check-ins, as well as the group as a whole, during our stand-up
        meetings. Were there times when I myself was pessimistic about our
        progress in the project? Sure, but as a leader it's a brutally poor
        practice to let that negativity trickle down to your team. Giving
        feedback or expressing concern is one thing.  Saying out loud, "We're
        screwed" is a different matter entirely. Given the feedback I received
        from the group, written and verbal, I would say that this method went
        pretty well and helped us meet our goals.
          It's been a pretty great inning, and I've been fortunate to work in
        groups that didn't storm hardly at all. As far as negatives go, I may
        have been irritatingly positive at times. That feedback was never
        given to me directly; however, it was an impressions that I received at
        times. I'm working on throttling my positivity slightly so as not to
        be damaging to my groups goals.

  * Feedback II & StrengthsFinder
    https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/feedback_ii.md
    My Johari Window:
      https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kh00J00E5YfD0XwxtHBzxHMHODFZioEQIzxyZudfLsU/edit?usp=sharing

    Deliverable:
      Reflection on how you incorporated feedback from your team
      members and what you learned about yourself in the process


        Receiving feedback isn't terribly difficult. I would submit that the
      challenge lies in hearing what they have to say, dissecting it, and
      applying the feedback is the difficult part. It's been stated elsewhere
      how fortunate I was to work with such great teams on projects this inning.
      I wouldn't qualify any of the feedback I received as negative; the points
      points made for improvement were more there for me to work with.
        The best feedback I got was from Spencer and Jonathan on the Bikeshare
      project. Both cited that I contributed great things to the project, but
      that I need to work out where I draw the line on when to call it quits
      and go home. "If you grit when you're supposed to grow, you're gonna
      have a bad time" became the saying. I have a bad habit of pushing myself
      in my work to the points where it's unhealthy. Read: I haven't gotten
      more than two hours of sleep the night before a project is due silence
      becoming a student. This is because I'm barreling away at it throughout
      the night.  Both Spencer and Jonathan expressed concern over this; I've
      been concerned over it also but haven't made it a point to take steps to
      put an end to that pattern.
        We're working on LittleShop at the time of this writing. During our
      group DTR, I expressed that I wanted to focus on improving my work/life
      balance in taking on the project. I was met with nods of understanding
      and general agreement that it was an important piece of being a developer
      and a Turing student. Throughout the course of this project, I've worked
      hard at managing my time appropriately and going to bed at a more than
      reasonable hour on a nightly basis. I feel pretty great physically and
      emotionally from making this change, and our work has remained on track
      to be completed on time with no midnight oil necessary.
        I'm pretty happy to have implemented that behavior change with relative
      success; it's a trend I'm going to work very hard to carry with me to Mod
      3 next inning.
        I found the Johari Window exercise interesting. I'm thankful Allison
      was kind enough to drop in and explain what it was before we filled out
      surveys for each other. I filled out my own evaluation and everyone elses'
      honestly. I was anxious but eager to read the feedback I received Monday
      morning. The link for my Johari Window is above this writing if you
      care to look. The outcome of the Johari window was revealing. I was happy
      to see that my self assessment aligned pretty well with the feedback
      I received from my previous teammates. It seems like I have a decent idea
      of how I come of to most people. In the not known to me but noticed by
      others box were a lot of positive adjectives that I didn't apparently
      give myself credit for on my self-evaluation. It's possible looking at
      my window that I don't give myself enough credit for the positive
      attributes I exhibit. It would be a poor a assumption to label this as
      poor self-esteem. It's more that I'm aware that I have these
      characteristics, but if I choose to recognize them then I risk
      stagnating any growth in the areas. I fear accidentally becoming a
      pompous ass honestly. I do my best to remain humble and thankful, and
      there is zero reason to change that.
        As far as the rest of the window is concerned, there are areas that I
      can do some work in terms of my self-perception as indicated by the
      'Facade (Hidden)' window. The 'Unknown' window is poorly labeled in my
      opinion. These are characteristics that neither I nor others perceive
      in me. I'm happy for most of these labels to be living in this box. The
      most concerning thing living in this box presently is 'Confident'.....
      work in progress. What else can I say?
        Overall, I was appreciative for the session. It gave some good
      strategies on dissecting feedback that I will carry forward and use
      in future activities.

  * Mentor Plan

    I haven't made finding a mentor a distinct priority the past two modules.
  I've made one attempt per module without any luck. The first time we didn't
  click particularly well, and I wasn't driven to pursue that. I reached out to
  another mentor who expressed enthusiasm at speaking and beginning a mentor
  relationship; however, I haven't heard back from him despite reaching out to
  schedule a time to talk twice in the past week. I'm not sure that this one will
  work out either. I understand and respect that our mentors have their own lives
  and are busy, but if you're busy to the point where you leave somebody hanging
  for a week, that's kinda lame and leaves me hard-pressed to attempt to forge
  a relationship that may operate off of similar patterns.
    I'm going to reach out to some fellow students over break and get
  recommendations. We're going to be having a class on cold outreach today I
  think. That may be helpful in finding a mentor. I'm going to comb through
  the mentor list over intermission and attempt to touch base with a few
  mentors. Should be good times.

  Spencer Carter:
    I have had an absolutely great time working with you during Mod2. You are
  easily the most energetic person in the room, and the atmosphere always
  lightens up when you walk in. I greatly respect your grit and the
  determination you bring with you when you're confronted with a problem. I'm
  proud to have you as a part of our cohort. We've talked about our mutually
  tendency to try and just gut through problems. Next inning, it would help
  you, I think, if you were more quick to reach out for help. I'm always down
  for a conversation or trying to figure something out. Our cohort is a team,
  and teammates look out for each other. I look forward to working with you
  through Mod 3. We're gonna rock it.

  Charlotte Moore:
    It's been a terrific time getting to know you during Mod 2. Thank you
  for being so responsive to questions, and generally amazingly thorough in
  answering them. You helped clarify more than one thing that I didn't
  understand this inning, and I really appreciate that. I'm glad you
  started opening up and talking more. That's a difficult barrier for anyone to
  overcome, but you're breaking through it awesomely! Given that it seems we're
  going to be heading into the realm of networking and job-hunting next Mod, I
  think it would be helpful for you to keep up progress in that area. It's an
  absolute pleasure having you in our cohort, and I'm really looking forward to
  seeing what Mod 3 has in store. It's gonna be a good time.

  Dan Olson:
    Dan O! You've helped to make Mod 2 an amazing experience. I greatly
  appreciate the humor and level-headedness you bring to our cohort. You're a
  source of near-constant relief from the stress that the course load places on
  us. I also respect how you reach out for help; that's something that I struggle
  with a good bit. I've noticed in the past few weeks that you've been more
  hesitant to ask questions during class. For the rest of Turing, please don't
  hesitate. If you have the question, chances are at least half of us do. Your
  question-asking helps everyone learn and by no means hinders it. I'm excited
  to go through Mod 3 with you in our cohort. We're gonna have a great time.


### Getting Feedback

    From Dan Olson:
    Andy,
      Of all the people in our cohort, you helped me stay grounded when I got stuck
    or frustrated. Your willingness to reach out and check-in with me is your best
    trait. I always knew that I could lean on you if I had to vent or if we needed
    to go for a walk you were always willing. Seeing you progress through this program
    has been an inspiration. The way you communicate with people makes you so easy to
    talk to. You always listen to understand and I and everyone else appreciate that
    about you. Als, your lightning talk on communication was awesome!!! Keep it
    up Andy. You got this!!!

### Being a Community Member

### Playing a Part

Hamilton Posse
  I chose to join the Hamilton Posse this inning.
I chose Hamilton because I like the idea of engaging
in activities or delivering things that would
directly benefit the Turing Community. I had been
helping to plan a session on Atom shortcuts/packages/
tips/tricks; however, while that was in progress a
similar Spike session was delivered. That was pretty
disappointing as I was looking forward to it, but
I feel more like a part of the Turing community after
this inning; this would easily be my favorite part of
choosing to join a posse this inning. I plan on pushing
Hamilton to put out at least some interesting Spike
sessions next inning. I would like to put together a
product of some kind that would be beneficial for
students/faculty; we have some plans on that, but I'm
going to work harder to instigate projects and contribute
next inning. It'll be good times.
  I haven't necessarily experienced a lot of growth
as a professional. The most growth I've experienced
from the posse is a drive to deliver things which
would benefit the Turing community. I'm happy to
feel more inspired/have a purpose to do things.
