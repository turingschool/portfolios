# Edilene Da Cruz - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I have a deep desire to learn programming and be really good at it. I'm hoping to learn to manage my time better to accomplish all the task that are presented while still making time to make friends and participate in the various events that Turing offers.

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edilenedacruz/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

This is a playable version of the game Mastermind using a REPL interface. Well, at least it was supposed to be. Not a project I'm proud of but definitely a lesson to learn. 

Notes:

Test suite was setup but no assertions made.
Could play through to show the user input but not able to analyze letters
Score:

1.Test-Driven Development

1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

2: Application's REPL has inconsistencies and/or there are errors in base gameplay
3. Breaking Logic into Components

2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.
5. Enumerable & Collections

1: Application does not use enumerables.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

NightWriter and Black Thursday

#### NightWriter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edilenedacruz/NightWriter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

This was a paired project with Drew Palazzari. This project is based on Napoleon's demand for a code that soldiers could use to safely communicate silently and without light at night. This project had several pieces that were needed to complete the translation from normal characters and Braille-like text and reverse. It was a very demanding project and as the first paired project, it was comforting to know that someone else was there to push you through it. 

Notes:

32 tests - all passing
Had some trouble with where the files live in the root and lib etc.
Make runner class include methods as well
The tests need to cover all of the methods

Scores:

1.Test-Driven Development
2.5: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

2.Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

3.Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

4.Overall Functionality
3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

Drew was clearly more knowledgable than me and that at times I felt very useless during the project. Due to that I just didn’t come up with any good ideas that worked, so naturally, they couldn’t actually be used. However, I was good at finding good ideas for refactoring, finding things that we should change (usually nomenclature) and solving all the small problems and errors that he couldn’t. 

Drew did make sure that I understood everything that was happening and made time to attempt to get me more involved and asked for ideas on how to solve problems. Despite his efforts to motivate me I just couldn’t get things right.

My partner was sad that I felt useless as he did not share that sentiment, but is happy that I told him that I learned a great deal about coding while working with him. Looking back now, I wish I had made sure to tell him that regardless of how I felt, I was very blessed to have paired with him. 
#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cews7/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

This is a paired project with Eric Wahlgren-Sauro. In the Black Thursday project we are building a system to load, parse, search and execute business intelligence queries against the date from a typical e-commerce business. It's a very large project that is extremelly challenging but once completed, it's rewarding to know that you were able to build something that detailed.   

Notes:

Solid test coverage, would love to see some of these attribute tests separated into separate tests
Completed through i4
Nice use of some modules; could go further with this with extracting SA functionality into additional modules/classes
Ruby style consistently solid
Consistent use of best-choice enumerables
Scores:

1. Functional Expectations

3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5
2. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
5. Enumerable & Collections

4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
6. Code Sanitation

The output from rake sanitation:all shows...

4: Zero complaints

(feedback to me)
## D: Professional Skills

I'm used to focus on skills that I can prove with a task or with a certificate but often forget that are more valuable skills to learn. It was great to have my eyes opened to other skills. 

### Gear Up
#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

As I have struggled to adapt to the "Turing" way of teaching, this gear up come in a little too late for me - or was it presented at the right time? - to help me understand the lesson that I was being taught the whole time. However, it was the most meaningful, as it showed me that I can train or teach myself to think differently during a time of adversity and thrive instead of failing. It also shows the power of positive thoughts, a topic that I'm constantly trying to focus on. 

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

This gear up was extremely valuable to me as it opened my eyes to the introverted personality, which I'm typically not drawn to. I wouldn't have realized the loss that our society suffers from approaching introverts so carelessly and not validating who they truly are. Because of this gear up, I will certainly be more careful when dealing with an introverted person and will work harder to nurture their natural disposition.

#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

It was great to refresh our knowledge on our civic duties. Voting is a dreaded mandatory responsibility for Brazilian nationals so the fact that Americans can vote on their own will makes this civic duty even more special as there isn't a penalty for not voting, at least not imposed penalties. During the gear up, we all agreed that as a citizen, we cannot complain about how the government entities operates if we are not following them close and to the holding them accountable for their actions, after all, they are working to safeguard the well being of all citizens.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding Part I

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edilenedacruz)

Without having any experience in development, job searching was a big concern to me until this workshop. I now believe that focusing on the right qualities, looking a job will be less stressful.

#### Feedback I

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/feedback_1.md)

Even though the workshop was great at opening my eyes to giving and receiving feedback - something I'm terrible at it - it wasn't until I had my second paired project was over that I realized the importance of taking your time to think about your words and they will affect the recipient. This workshop should have refreshers every module and surely more practice.   

#### Learning to Pair: Define the Relationship and Hold Each Other Accountable

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZKXj7KwItINffINNjboLqapS5anFqQaDUGSXIZUYIY/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzJETXxYxATVYUE2bGpzbEt2T1E)

Pairing doesn't seem hard, right? Wrong. There are so many ways that pairing can not produce the end result expected, that's why it's important to practice as much as possible. During my pairing sessions it became very clear the importance of good communication and lots of respect for each other.  


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Eric Wahlgren-Sauro - "I couldn't have asked a better partner for the crazy end of module project. Eric was genuinely determined to help strengthen my knowledge even if that meant not progressing as fast as we ideally should have and for that I'm truly thankful cause I've learned so much. Eric showed me the right way to program using "red, green, refactor", to properly sudo code and to think out loud while programming. Throughout the module Eric also stayed after class to help me understand some exercises and always checked back to see if I needed additional help. Thank you for your support! I hope that we will be able to work together in the future."

Amara Lovato - "Amara, your positivity is absolutely contagious and your desire to strengthen the student community is amazing! During the hardships that learning something new brings, you were always there to encourage and remind me the ultimate goal of this amazing, crazy and long road we are on. I hope that I will have the chance to work with you in a project and continue to share a little bit of our cultures through food like we did this module. Keep spreading positivity!"

Brett Rivers - "From day one you made yourself available to help all of us learn programming and understand the "Turing way". Also, during the first individual project you noticed right away that I needed some extra help and without being asked, you offered your help and stayed at school when you actually needed to go home. Please continue influencing all us with your good attitude."


### Being a Community Member

Amara Lovato - "Edilene, your incredible resilience and hard work are an inspiration to me. Your always positive and encouraging attitude made many of us keep moving forward in this challenging experience. You are a very caring person with a big heart, always asking us how we were doing and sharing with us resources and even pairing sessions in your committed will to help us. I am positive that you will be successful in your goal to become a great developer because you are not only smart and resourceful but also a one-of-a-kind team member."

### Playing a Part

I decided to participate in a posse and was very fortunate to be at Pahlka. Their dedication to help others reminds me of why I decided to embark in this life-changing journey and I can’t wait to be able to contribute more to the posse and help others in the future. The Turing “family” is just awesome! I loved meeting classmates and other cohorts students after class, during Gear Ups and Lunch Roulettes. It’s so much fun getting to know them and I hope to keep strengthening our bonds. I’m truly looking forward to being able to give back more to the Turing community than I have taken this module.
