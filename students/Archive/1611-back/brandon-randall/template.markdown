# Brandon Randall - M2 Portfolio
## Areas of Emphasis

During my Module 1 portfolio review, Beth and Ilana expressed that I was an excellent collaborator. As I went through Mod 2, I quickly realized that I still needed to improve on this particular skill. My mid-mod assessment with Sal and my final assessment with Andrew exposed the fact that I need to verbally establish proper implementations before taking action with code. With that being my main focus going into mod 3, I am now fixated on knowing not only the higher level scope of a project, but being able to explain every aspect of functionality, thus creating a clearer path throughout the development process.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 2.33
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 2.67
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------
## A: End of Module Assessment

### Evaluation Criteria
Evaluator: Andrew Carmer

Student: Brandon

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:
####1. Conceptual Understanding
  * 2: Developer is able to describe concepts with a moderately high degree of specificity and accuracy with some assistance/questioning

####2. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking
  * 2: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them with little assistance

####3. Feature Completeness
  * 2: Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests

####4. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style
  * 3: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods with minimal support and understands the relationship between models and the database

####5. Rails Style
  * 2: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

####6. Testing
  * 3: Developer understands errors produced by tests, and uses them to drive development independently

####7. Collaboration
  * 3: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Following are my individual projects from Module 2 at Turing.

#### 1. Bikeshare

The purpose of bike share was to implement an app with Sinatra which only has the basics of what you need to create a web app.

Alex Fosco:
  Brandon,
  I had a great experience working with you on Bikeshare. I appreciate that you were quick to ask questions and you were always willing to answer my own. You were also quick to get the ball rolling on the CRUD functionality which was great. I know you have family commitments and you did a good job of communicating with the team when this would affect you contributing to the project, which enabled us to plan ahead for these conflicts. I don't really have any constructive criticism I'm just looking forward to working with you again in the future.

Valerie Trudell:
    Brandon,
  I enjoyed working on bike share with you. We worked hard, and you really pulled us through the test portion of bike share. I see that you are a determined person; on the last night you showed that when you came back to work with us and it just showed me you really cared and were willing to stick it out. On future projects I would push for you to take on more. I think you underestimate yourself; you did a good job and you could gain a lot by diving in even if you don't feel comfortable. I look forward to working with you in future pairings.

#### Mix Master

This ungraded project was a tutorial to introduce us to creating and testing an app in Rails, and pushing it to Heroku. This also showed us what each notation in the creation of a rails app would initiate; example: -T and --database=postgresql.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Following are my group projects from Module 2.

#### Job Tracker

The objective of Job Tracker was to create associations in Rails. There were various one-to-many and many-to-many relationships which we had to establish with the pre-created app that were extremely useful given the context of companies with jobs and categories. I find these tutorials very useful.

### Rubric (self-assessed)

#### 1) Database, Relationships, and Migrations

* 3: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

#### 2) Routes

* 3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.

#### 3) Controllers

* 3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.

#### 4) ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.

#### 5) Views

* 3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.

#### 6) User Experience

* 4: The application has been styled and the user can easily navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.

#### Little Shop/Wabi Sabi(E-commerce app)

* [GitHub URL]
* [Original Assignment]
* [Heroku App]
This app is a mock store called Root & Branch, which is a marketplace for socially responsible goods. It is a fully functioning web store written in Rails, complete with user authentication and admin authorization, a functioning cart and checkout, and Bootstrap styling.

This project was a ton of fun, and I had a great group. We worked hard on the code, testing, refactoring, and styling, and I am really happy to have this app to show people.


## D: Professional Skills
Following are the Gear Up sessions and Professional Development workshops that I have participated in this module.

### Gear Up
#### Bridging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL]

In this session, we discussed the controversy and the history of insufficient inclusion females in the tech industry. I dont quite agree with the video as it was only focused on three women who all had bad experiences during their coding journeys. I wouldn't be surprised if the stats of modern day coding places are different from when that video was released. I do, however, agree with the philosophies of inclusion that the video was trying to convey.

#### Gear up with Ilana(biases in the workplace)

* [GitHub URL]

In this session, Ilana showed us an mini game that demonstrated the fact that the more exclusive people want to be, the less satisfied they would be in life. This is because it is really difficult to create total exclusion. We also had a group discussion that showed me that some people are just products of their environment, which is why unrealistic biases perpetuate.

#### Automation Implementation

* [GitHub URL]

In this session, we had a group reading/discussion regarding what people will do as robots take more jobs from people.  I don,t think that will affect the world in a negative way because the classes of people that would be out of work would not be changed. They would only have more free time. It would also eliminate poverty.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

Valerie Trudell - Brandon, I enjoyed working on bike share with you. We worked hard, and you really pulled us through the test portion of bike share. I see that you are a determined person; on the last night you showed that when you came back to work with us and it just showed me you really cared and were willing to stick it out.

Brandon, 

I made a terrible mistake during our Bike Share project: splitting up the work before we worked as a group more. I definitely missed out on getting to know you more and exchange ideas and code more often. It was great hearing about your life experiences and how they translate to your life changing adventure to programming. I've learned so much about fairness, teamwork and perspective, all by how you handled the issues that occurred during the project. I would love to see you bring your leadership role from team sports into programming, something you said you've heard it before. Don't be afraid to speak up and make sure that the project has a little bit more of your ideas in the future. It will enrich the whole process. I'm sorry that you are taking a quick break but I'm looking forward in seeing you in the next cohort.
