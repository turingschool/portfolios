-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment Status

#1. Ruby Style
* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

#2. Rails Syntax & API
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#3. Testing
* 2: Developer writes tests. Most new lines of code are tested but they aren’t effective at testing for functionality and value.
NOTE: 5 tests, 3 failing - feature & request

#4. Progression/Completion
* 2: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.
NOTE: API working, nothing showing on page.

#5. Workflow
* 3: Developer commits almost every 15 minutes


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### APIcurious

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alfosco/apicurious)

(description)
-This project focuses on consuming and working with data from public APIs. I selected Github's API and re-constructed a simplified version of the website’s existing UI for a logged-in user using their own API. I was a little confused once again at the start of this with how to consume an API. After receiving a little help the rest of the project flowed better. I thought it was really cool seeing for the first time all the info you can access for your own application and I got very familiar with using Postman which has been helpful.

#### Self-Directed Project (Puppy Love)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alfosco/puppy_love)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)
*   [In Production](https://pup-love.herokuapp.com/)

(description)
-Puppy Love uses information from the Petfinder API to enable users to find shelter dogs close to them that need a loving home. It allows users to search for dogs by zip code, and will return a page with the closest dogs to them and some information about them. If you click on the dog's name it directs you to their show page which provides more information about them, and info about the shelter they are located at, including an embedded google map by use of the Google Maps API with the shelter marked. Users can log into the site by way of Google Oauth. This project was slow starting off because I did not have any good ideas for an app to build. Once I went with Puppy Love the project ran pretty smoothly and it was great to get more repetitions on consuming APIs.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Rails Engine

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AELSchauer/turing-rails_engine_api)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

(description)
-This project is an API sales data analysis tool. It used Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema. There was a learning curve for me starting out on this project as I have never played with an API before. The advanced active record was also a challenge. I starting picking up these new concepts about half-way through the project and received a lot of help from my pair (Ashley) who was great.

(evaluation scores)
# Feature Delivery
**1. Completion**
* 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 3 (5 for individual project) or fewer spec harness tests.
# Technical Quality
**1. Test-Driven Development**
* 3: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>80%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
**2. Code Quality**
* 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
**3. API Design**
* 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.
**4. Queries**
* 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.

#### FolioShare (Cloney Island)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cmacaulay/folio-share)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)
*   [In Production](https://folio-share.herokuapp.com/)

(description)
-FolioShare is clone of the popular file-sharing site Dropbox. It allows guests to browse publicly available files. Has functionality for guest, user, and admin roles. Registered users can create public or private folders that they can upload files to. Registered users can invite other users to contribute to public or private folders. Users are able to download zipfiles of content they have access to. This project was a little exhausting but the group worked great together and the PM (Casey) did a great job of keeping the project organized. It was great to see the project come together and I got to work with Materialize for the first time for styling. There were some pieces of functionality that I would have liked to get reps on but I did not have time to touch or get really familiar with every feature.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Microaggressions

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

(takeaways from session)
**How have you experienced microagressions in your time at Turing or in your life?**
* I don't think I have. If it happened I didn't make a big deal about it because I don't care what people say about me or think about me.
**What ways have you been able to address microagressions that you have seen happen?**
* I haven't noticed any. If the intent was serious I would tell the person to wise up, if the intent was in a joking manner and the victim made a mountain out of a mole hill I'd tell them to stop being so dramatic. If the worst thing that happens in your day is someone says something that offends you then you have a great life. A lot of people have problems that include worrying about finding clean drinking water, when/where their next meal will come from, having to live with a physically abusive spouse or parent and many more situations that are extremely worse.

#### Grit

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

(takeaways from session)
#Think of a time at Turing when you've been tempted to give up.
**Is it possible to interpret that experience through the lens of grit, i.e. your grit to get through a difficult situation was under strain?**
* At the end of my first time going through module one I decided I was going to quit. I was struggling a lot and wasn't convinced that I could learn the material. Mike talked about it with me and I decided to stay. My grit was definitely under strain. But I stuck with it, got a lot of help and put in a lot of work, and I feel confident in my abilities.
**Is that lens helpful?**
* This lens is very helpful. I've been successful at a lot of things but I haven't really challenged my brain like they do at Turing. I just have to be patient and understand sometimes it will take a longer time than I want it to. But you will always be successful if you put in the time, work and dedication.
**Is it in any way problematic (emphasizing pushing through when you really need a break)?**
* I think this really depends on the situation. Sometimes it depends on the situation. I think you should just push through as hard as you can until it starts to compromise your physical or mental health. At the point you draw the line and take a break.

#### Automation

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

(takeaways from session)
**How serious an impact will automation have on our economy from now until I retire?**
* Probably a very significant impact. Everything in VR, augmented reality, every household object is an IOT, eventually humans driving cars will be illegal, more things I don't envision yet.

**Will I be affected by it?**
* Probably in my current field. If I stay educated on current technologies related to my field I should be fine though.

**What does it mean to be a responsible citizen on this issue?**
* Recognize new technologies and the new careers they create. Don't grow attached to jobs that have been around for awhile that have become irrelevant.

**What role can Turing play in advancing civic responsibility in response to the challenges automation will bring?**
* They can help students become more adaptable, more 'agile' in life. I'm sure someday web development will become an outdated profession and people in that field will have to learn new skills to stay relevant in the job market. Don't fight that situation just learn how to become an asset in a new field.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

#Co-lead Spike
-I co-led a spike with John and Ashley. The topic was building a webscraper to pull information off of a web page for your own application. It was an interesting topic and it had a large crowd from the Turing community. The attendees seemed to enjoy the code-along as most of them have never done it before and it provided another tool for them to grab data if a site does not have an API. I helped demonstrate how to create your own app that scrapes Reddit's front page for information (titles and links) to use in your own Rails app.

#Pre-work Guide
-I am the pre-work guide for Eddie Rose. I have answered his questions regarding certain topics in the pre-work and being at Turing. I have also sent him some drills to practice that helped me when I was struggling and we are set to pair on Mythical Creatures when he returns from a vacation next week.
