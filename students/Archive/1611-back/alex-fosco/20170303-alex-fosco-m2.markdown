## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Mix Master

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alfosco/mix_master)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mix_master/1_getting_started)

-This app kept track of songs, artists, and playlists. It was the first project that put together everything we learned up to this point in M2 and concluded with the final product being deployed to Heroku. It was cool to learn how to implement new tools into a rails application like Heroku and OAuth. The exposure to working with heroku helped when using it with little shop. I also found iteration 5 very helpful which dealt with refactoring the application. On a lot of projects I overlook pieces that can be refactored and this section did a great job of illustrating common areas that need it. Refactoring forms with a partial and using a before action to refactor a controller really stuck with me after this.

#### Gif Generator

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alfosco/gif_generator)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

-This app was supposed to use the GiphyApi to generate gifs and allow users to interact with them. I wasn't able to get the API working though. This was the first project that I implemented the functionality for authentication and authorization for users. I ended up doing this project up to the point where I needed to implement the API and then deleting it and recreating it up to the same point several times over. I thought it would be beneficial to get repetition on creating the authentication and authorization functionality over banging my head over the API. This also gave me repitions on creating feature tests in RSpec which I feel very comfortable with. I'm not happy about the fact that I didn't complete it but I tried to salvage something out of it by getting repetitions on features I should know how to implement.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Bike Share

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edilenedacruz/bike-share)
*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

(description)
-This project used Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.

(evaluation comments)
-Good homepage and styling. First impressions position.
-Navigation throughout site looks pretty good.
-Missing CSS on a specific pages of the site. Will look into it in code review.
-ActiveRecord is generally clean and good use of methods. Some more advanced AR is not quite there.
-Good code structure and organization for a first attempt. A little more refactoring possible but good.
-Tests don't quite hit the mark. The feature tests don't always test desired information like the dynamic content. Also not much use of anything other than "has_content". Model tests don't test custom methods.

(evaluation scores)
1. Functional Expectations
        -2: Application has some small missing base functionality
2. ActiveRecord
        -3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.
3. User Experience and Conventions
        -3: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional  improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.
4. Code Organization/Quality
        -3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/responses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.
5. Testing
        -2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
6. Working Collaboratively
        -3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

(feedback to me)

Alex,
It was an enjoyable and inspirational experience working with you on bikeshare. You have inspired me to be willing to work late into the night to continue my learning which yielded nothing but positive results for me. I have now developed a stamina and focus which has now potentially tripled my learning capacity in life. You are generous coworker are a positive collaborator. Thats gonna pay off major for you. I look forward to our next venture!
-Brandon

Alex,
It's crazy to think that we haven't worked together before! But it came on the right time. Bike Share was so complex and full of new concepts that during the chaos you were just what we needed. You are even-tempered, analytical and non-judgmental and was truly the peacekeeper throughout the week. We could always count on your knowledge and you constantly delivered great code, fully tested without needing refactoring. Please continue letting your hard work and amazing ethics to show through your projects and allow your leadership skills show more often; we could all benefit from good leaders and from someone to reel us back in sometimes. I really hope we work together again.
-Edilene

Alex,
You were great to work with on bike share. You worked as hard as I had hoped, you kept your cool during crunch time, and your easy to work with; having you on the team was a pleasure and I look forward to working together again. In future work, I think it would benefit you if you took on work that you are the least familiar with; although you did that a little bit with bike share, you should be conscious of it going in to a project. It was a pleasure working on a team with you; I'm very happy with the work we did.
-Valerie

#### Little Shop of Orders (PogHogs)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alfosco/pog_hogs)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

(description)
-This project uses Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering. My group made PogHogs, an online marketplace for pogs and pog accessories.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

(takeaways from session)

Let's say tech executives (consciously or subconsciously) seek teams in which at least 1/3 of team members are like them (gender, age, race). How will this impact the types of jobs available?
	-This will limit the amount of candidates you look at for your job openings. It will eliminate people from contention for traits that aren't relevant to the job requirements.

Diversity "quotas" are sometimes dismissed as counter-productive or missing the point of actually valuing diversity. PotP does demonstrate how they may add some value. What are your attitudes toward diversity quotas; does this game change your assumptions?
	-This game does not change my thoughts. Diversity quotas are ridiculous. You should only be concerned that someone has the qualifications/skill to do the job, and that they are decent person you wouldn't mind working with. Diversity quotas are in fact racist. They require you to fill positions solely based on the color of your skin or race. They are implemented in organizations that want social brownie points. They want the attention of the rest of the world to look at them and admire them instead of just hiring good people regardless of what they look like.

PotP speaks to the power of group norms: a seemingly innocuous attitude, wanting to be surrounded by at least 1/3 of people who look like you, when embraced by a large group, can have huge implications on that community. Considering this reality, what knowledge and understandings should Turing impart to students to ensure they do not enter the field perpetuating ideas that are in conflict with our mission.
	-Be up front with people, and discuss ideas face to face. Social media always causes problems when discussing ideas because you are not interacting with someone face to face. So less use of social media.

PotP is a pretty sweet example of how technology can illustrate complex ideas. What are PotP's goals, and how effective do you think the game is in advancing those goals?
	-PotP was built very well and has a great user interface.

#### The Gender Gap in Technology

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

(takeaways from session)

How are your experiences at Turing similar or different than those in the documentary?
	-The only similarity is that Turing is inclusive to everyone unless you do not agree with their politics. They have a habit of bashing people who aren't liberal or politically correct.

What role do you play in creating inclusiveness in your cohort and Turing as a whole?
	-It's pretty simple. Don't be a jerk. And seek out people you haven't had the chance to spend time with and get to know them more.

What's a situation at Turing that might be similar to that in the movie? What could've been done differently to positively impact the situation?
	-In the past module we had a classmate who was under the legal drinking age. The cohort would sometimes have informal gatherings at a bar and he was not able to participate. It was unfortunate, we assumed everyone was over 21 and he did not let us know of his age until the end of the module. In the future we should not 'assume' and we should ask questions to double check so no one is left out.

#### Universal Basic Income

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

(takeaways from session)

How would you describe the "realities" of our future economy? What constraints and opportunities will we face as a nation?
	-It's hard to say. The economy will always evolve and jobs will go out of fashion that were staples for a long time. People need to learn the new skills and fields that are in demand to keep up with the times. Automation will eliminate some jobs for sure, people just need to find new ways to provide value to the marketplace/society.

What's your reaction to hearing tech leaders like Elon Musk describe UBI as a "foregone conclusion"?
	-He was just stating his opinion and I don't think it needs to be read into any more than that. He's a brilliant engineer and businessman.

Write a quick elevator pitch synthesizing what you've read from these articles: what is UBI, why is it entering policy debates, what do you think people should know about automation and its affect on our workforce?
	-Some politicians are pitching the idea of UBI to garner more votes from people who don't want to work or learn new skills. If I had a UBI of $2000 a month I would have no desire to get a job and I'd just surf, snowboard, and pursue my hobbies 24/7.

-Do you think it's worthwhile to be educated about automation, its affect on our workforce, and policy solutions like UBI? What does it look like to be a responsible citizen in the face of such a large, inevitable transformation? Do you think you can really have an impact -- if not, why put energy into being informed?
		-I used to think its great to be informed and aware of what's going on but our political system is far beyond the point of ever being salvaged and respectable. So I don't really care about these issues. It needs to crash and burn. Until then it's probably more worth your time to find loopholes to exploit it to your advantage instead of trying to fix it, which is unfortunately what most people in our government do.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Project Management Strategies

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/agile_practices_project_management.md)

(takeaways from session)

-This was one of the more valuable professional development workshops. My group for Bikeshare was a little disorganized and it slowed down the progress of the project. It was the first time working in a large group on a project and it was the first time we were using some of tools and strategies discussed in this workshop. At the conclusion of Little Shop I can say we have done a much better job utilizing what we learned in this workshop. The communication is great, our workflow on github is smooth and we are effectively using Waffle.io to organize tasks to be completed on the project. Becoming more familiarized with the tools and having experience working in a large group aided this.

#### Feedback II

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/feedback_ii.md)

-Most the feedback I receive is pretty accurate. I really appreciate it when my peers don't just say nice fluffed up things but point out specific flaws. I'm pretty easy to get along with and compromise so I try to implement any feedback suggestions in practice if it can make me a better person/teammate/developer. I have learned that I am my harshest critic and I am not as slow as I think I am sometimes.

#### StengthsFinder-Johari Window

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/johari_window_activity.md)
*   [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rM16g4_MOidlyB2StBR5Cz1SqUbCsdtNNtdPmHAFbs4/edit)

-The Johari Window is a useful tool for comparing how you see yourself compared to how others perceive you. Everything actually lined up for the most part for traits I gave myself and traits my peers saw in me. Someone did say I was an extrovert though which I was surprised by though, which is pretty cool. They only thing I didn't like was that all the feedback to your peers was anonymous. I get some people may be more honest if they remain anonymous in their feedback but I think we should reinforce giving constructive criticism face to face. It's not fun to do but it won't get any easier if we avoid it.

#### Cold Outreach

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/cold_outreach_i.md)

(takeaways from session)

-I currently have David Maurer as a mentor. I reached out to him the last week of module 1 my first time through. I was really struggling and saw how helpful he was to a peer and he did a lot of pairing in person which i preferred. My second time through module 1 David helped me out a lot by running me through the mythical creatures repeatedly and breaking down whats happening under the hood. He also whiteboarded with me to start of my projects and start me off on the right foot. I haven't met up with him as frequently in module 2 and I plan to schedule more sessions with him in the coming weeks. I also am going to start the search and outreach for a mentor that can school me on professional development in the web development field.

### Giving Feedback

Bike Share

Brandon,
I had a great experience working with you on Bikeshare. I appreciate that you were quick to ask questions and you were always willing to answer my own. You were also quick to get the ball rolling on the CRUD functionality which was great. I know you have family commitments and you did a good job of communicating with the team when this would affect you contributing to the project, which enabled us to plan ahead for these conflicts. I don't really have any constructive criticism I'm just looking forward to working with you again in the future.

Valerie,
It was great working with you on Bikeshare. I admired your work ethic and that you wanted to learn new concepts. You were always in a good mood which made working with you fun and relaxed. You also did a great job of laying the foundation for the styling of the project, and at a time when no one was really familiar with it. You were selected as the project manager and you should have done a better job of taking charge of the project and being the deciding voice to settle any decisions regarding the project. I enjoyed working with you, and I'm looking forward to pairing with you again.

Edilene,
I enjoyed finally getting to work on a project with you after spending several modules together. You led the charge on parsing the CSV files which allowed the rest of the groups' features to work. You have incredible drive and it's nice to have a teammate who really cares about trying to make a project the best that it can be. Sometimes you were too ambitious though, and wanted to start implementing extensions before the base functionality was complete. I know they would be cool and we could learn new skills but there was work that had to be complete before we got to extensions and the group agreed that we should finish base functionality first. I also appreciated your commitment to diversifying what you were working on so you got a little bit of practice on a lot of different parts of the project. I'm sure it will enhance your understanding of everything we learned. Thanks for your hard work G!

### Playing a Part

-The biggest way I supported the larger Turing community this module was by pairing with M1 students. I paired with another student three times a week and helped them with drills, projects and other questions. I struggled a lot my first time through module 1 and pairing with students who were further along helped me advance to module 2. So I wanted to pay it forward to the current M1 students but it was also great to get a refresher on some ruby problems every couple of days.
