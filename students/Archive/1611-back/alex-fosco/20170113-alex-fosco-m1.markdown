* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

(description)

In this project Casey and I used Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm. We had to build an encryption engine for encrypting, decrypting, and cracking messages. Additionally, our program had to read messages from and output them to the file system.

(evaluation comments)

    -Application does not run
    -some issues with edge cases and deeper testing
    -overall code was written well, just crashed
    -some opportunities to break out things into separate objects,
    -started to head in that direction, just didnt finish.

(evaluation scores)

1.) Overall Functionality

2.) Fundamental Ruby & Style

    1: Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution
    
3.) Test-Driven Development

    3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.
    
4.) Breaking Logic into Components

    2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility

(feedback to me from Casey Macaulay)

I feel so lucky to have had you as a partner for my first pair project! Thank you so much for your patience as we worked through the problem and figured out how to use Git. I really appreciated how you made sure to check-in about how we were working together after each pairing session, and for your collaborative work style. I feel like there were times when we would get stuck on a problem where both of our wheels would be spinning. If you encounter this in future groups, I would suggest checking in with the other person to see if they want to take a break to try and break down the problem individually, or come up with a list of questions around each of your points of confusion. I think when you reach a point in a collaborative process where both partners are coming up empty is when to try a new approach, otherwise I think that working together to drive the project forward makes sense. I thought that you were a great communicator, showed empathy towards my struggles and you chose to persevere through exhaustion when everything was breaking. Thank you for sharing your technical knowledge with me, especially when it came to the file.io.

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/pixapi/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

(description)

In this project we built upon a dataset centered around schools in Colorado provided by the Annie E. Casey foundation. We built several different layers that include a "Data Access Layer" which allows us to query/search the underlying data, a "Relationships Layer" which creates connections between related data, and an "Analysis Layer" which uses the data and relationships to draw conclusions.

(evaluation comments)

	-109 tests all passing
	-pass spec harness except one method which we talked about (not in spec)
	-more robust testing needed
	-some refactoring as well

(evaluation scores)

1.) Functional Expectations

	2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes
	
2.) Test-Driven Development

	3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
	
3.) Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

	3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
	
4.) Fundamental Ruby & Style

	3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
	
5.) Enumerable & Collections

	3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
	
6.) Code Sanitation

	The output from rake sanitation:all shows...

	4: Zero Complaints

(feedback to me from Amara Lovato)

Alex has been an awesome pair to work with because of his personality and extraordinary team work mindset. He has tons of patience, a bright analytical mind and he handles his emotions and stress in an admirable way. He brings many other talents to our team such as attention to detail, resourcefulness, and positive attitude. He never seems bother for anything nor anyone and he is always eager to help others even if he is in the middle of figuring out a complex problem: he stops, offers them a smile and his full attention to whatever people need. He is very humble and approachable what makes being around him really nice, however he has much more knowledge that he thinks and should trust more in himself. He not only has a incredible background that shows his personal strengths and resilience but also has many talents that he seems to take for granted but are extraordinary. He is tenacious, very hardworking and never complains about problems, just stays calm and keep trying. Alex is a one-of-a-kind team partner and he makes any challenge to face meaningful and fun. Without doubt, this has been the most team spirit experience that I have had in Turing, and I canâ€™t wait to work with him again in next mods.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

The TED talk by Carol Dweck (The Power of Believing That You Can Improve) is appropiate for Mod 1 students before they really start the Turing program. Her story about the school giving kids who fail a grade of 'not yet' is a little corny but cool. I like the mindset they are trying to instill in their students.

Mod 4 students and alumni sharing the struggles they had while going through Turing was beneficial. I think it is good for the new students and myself to hear that these same people who seem very smart now, repeated and struggled just like some of us.
    
#### Cohort Norms

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_cohort_norms.markdown)

I have had a lot more success maintaining a growth mindest in my second go around of module 1. I have had help from alum David Maurer which has helped this, and also working with Kris Sparks.

I am an introvert, but I enjoy getting outside my comfort zone and being around people. I talk a lot more and open up when I am one-on-one with someone.
In a big group I let the chatty-kathys exhuast themselves then I insert myself in the conversation. I don't get any anxiety from it though.

#### Personal Narrative

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_personal_story.markdown)

What brought you here?

  -I was exposed to some basic HTML and CSS in college. I thought it was really cool. After college I served in the Army but I wanted to get into software development once my contract was up. I enjoy solving hard problems and the creativty of the field. As soon as I had the chance to start learning software development I dove in and now I'm here at Turing. 

What are the values that drive you?

  -The 'golden rule', treat others how you would want to be treated. Be blunt and upfront with people. Give people the benfit of the doubt. I also believe that if you are in a position where you can help someone you should, and it should start in your local community, then branch out further if you can.


#### Grit

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

Think of a time at Turing when you've been tempted to give up.
	â€¢	Is it possible to interpret that experience through the lens of grit, i.e. your grit to get through a difficult situation   was under strain?
	
    -At the end of my first time going through module one I decided I was going to quit. I was struggling a lot and wasn't convinced that I could learn the material. Mike talked about it with me and I decided to stay. My grit was definitely under strain. But I stuck with it, got a lot of help and put in a lot of work, and I feel very confident in my abilities now relating to what is taught in moudle 1.
	â€¢	Is that lens helpful?
	  
    -This lens is very helpful. I've been successful at a lot of things but I haven't really challenged my brain like they do at Turing. It wasn't always fun, but I learned that I can learn things that onced seemed impossible. I just have to be patient and understand sometimes it will take a longer time than I want it to. But you will always be successful if you put in the time, work and dedication.
    
	â€¢	Is it in any way problematic (emphasizing pushing through when you really need a break)?
  
	  -I think this really depends on the situation. Sometimes it depends on the situation. I think you should just push through as hard as you can until it starts to comprimise your physical or mental health. At the point you draw the line and take a break.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding Part I

* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/personal_branding_p1)
* [Link to My Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-fosco)
* [Link to My Resume](https://gist.github.com/alfosco/5dd952082ddb1bf53670f1913646085b)

Take advantage of tools like linkedin, twitter, or a personal website to showcase myself and my skills to potential employers and collaborators.
For my resume, translate my military skills and experiences into terms civilians will understand.
    
#### Learning to Pair

* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/learning_to_pair)

There are three common pairing techniques which are Driver-Navigator, Ping-Pong Pairing and Distributed Pairing. Currently I prefer the Driver-Navigator technique because I like to work with someone in person and I believe it is more beneficial to someone still learning OOP.

DTR is a valuable and smart technique to use when kicking off a group project. It really just helps you avoid some problems that might have surfaced in the group otherwise. Group retro's are valuable too but for these I'm a fan of doing it informally. Just being blunt and saying what needs to be said as apposed to going down a checklist of things to discuss.

#### Feedback I

* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/feedback_1)

When receiving feedback I prefer it to just be straight-forward and to the point. If I screw up, call me out on it so I know what I need to correct. I won't get my feelings hurt, only when the sports teams I root for lose does that happen. And that is how I prefer to give feedback. Lets identify what went right so we can continue that behavior and identify what doesn't work so we can make a plan of action on how to improve on that aspect.

#### Personal Branding Part II

* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/personal_branding_p2)

I am looking forward to building my own personal website after looking through some of the example ones from the class.
Going over and taking notes on how to format my website/what to include is also going to be big help when I start this project.

I do need to work on my personal story(Who am I? Where am I going? Whats next?) though. I am not active on social media and I am not that comfortable putting a lot of personal information on the internet.
I acknowledge this is something I will have to work on in this field. This is affecting my personal story because I think I'm trying to censor a lot of personal information out of it instead of just writing freely about what I think my story is.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me to Casey Macaulay for Enigma)

Casey,
Working with you on Enigma was a very good experience and I feel like you helped me improve my problem solving skills and understanding of the material. Having a positive and humorous attitude made you easy to work with. When things would blow up you never got discouraged and we could even have a laugh about some of them. You set a good habit of finding and fixing bugs before moving on to the next problem, even if they didn't immediately break anything. You were also quick and willing to explain how any part of the project worked that you built without me. I like to be able to understand how everything works in the project and this enabled that understanding.
Before starting the project read the instructions carefully! This goes for both of us. We did a good job of white-boarding to conceptualize a complex problem or class, but we should have done it to illustrate the framework of the entire project that is in sync with the instructions. A few times it was hard to follow you when talking about how some complex logic was working. When we then illustrated it in a notebook or on the whiteboard it was easier to follow. It didn't help of course that sometimes I was mentally drained. We both were willing to take a break from working on the project for things like dinner, it would be good though to set some mandatory break times away from the computer so we maintain the mental capacity to solve complex problems.
We didn't complete the project but you clearly know what you are doing and I know we could have finished it if we had a little more time. It took Alan Turing and his team almost 6 months to crack Enigma, we almost did it in a week. I look forward to pairing with you on a future project as we progress through the modules.

(feedback from me to Amara Lovato for Headcount)

Amara,
I had a great experience pairing with you on headcount. The project was very difficult and frustrating at times but I thought we made a great team and we were able to overcome all the obstacles that were thrown at us. I'm pretty amazed at how much we both learned by the end of the project, and I appreciate that you helped me learn these new skills. If we had one more day I know we could have finished iteration 6.
There is one habit you have that I think you can improve on. Their were a lot of occasions were we would come across an error or a problem and you would ask other people for help before investigating the problem and finding where it was happening. If you just took a little more time to pry into your files and identify where it was happening I believe you could have solved some of the problems on your own. The people who you were asking for help would probably also appreciate it if the pry 'dirty work' was already done before they looked at it so they could just focus on our logic.
You had an incredible drive and determination to solve each problem we were faced with, and I could clearly see that you have a passion for this profession. Keep this mentality, continue to practice and I'm sure you will have a successful career in software development. After working with you closely the past nine days, I think you are definitely ready for module 2 of Turing and I'm sure our instructors will see that too. Great job! I look forward to pairing with you again.

### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me from Casey Macaulay for Enigma)

I feel so lucky to have had you as a partner for my first pair project! Thank you so much for your patience as we worked through the problem and figured out how to use Git.

Thank you for sharing your technical knowledge with me, especially when it came to the file.io.

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
    -I enjoy and take part in all the lunch roulettes on Fridays. I make an effort to get the assigned group together and if they do not want to get together I join a different group for the day.
    -I always make myself availble to my peers for help. I enjoy it and it usually helps me understand what I'm teaching better.
    -I participated in the Name.com/Turing Hackathon. My group built a website that allows users to exchange unwanted Christmas gifts. It has you submit a gift you do not want and it randomly sends you someone else's regifted gift in return.
    -I am a member of the Maker/Turing Lab Posse. I got my hands on some arduinos and made some LEDs flash! Soon I will be kicking of a personal project here once a couple more parts arrive in the mail.
