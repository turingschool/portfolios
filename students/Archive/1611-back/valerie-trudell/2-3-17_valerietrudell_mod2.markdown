## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

- Bike Share

- Little Shop

#### Bike Share

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edilenedacruz/bike-share)
*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

## Description
-----------------
In this project you'll use Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.

This application will collect data in two ways: 1) through web forms allowing users to enter trip/station/weather information, and 2) by consuming CSV files with historical information for stations, trips, and weather. In addition to creating and storing this information for viewing at a later date, this application will provide a number of user dashboards with higher level analysis of trends in bike share usage.

## Evaluation Notes
---------------------

    Good homepage and styling. First impressions position.
    Navigation throughout site looks pretty good.
    Missing CSS on a specific pages of the site. Will look into it in code review.
    ActiveRecord is generally clean and good use of methods. Some more advanced AR is not quite there.
    Good code structure and organization for a first attempt. A little more refactoring possible but good.
    Tests don't quite hit the mark. The feature tests don't always test desired information like the dynamic content. Also not much use of anything other than "has_content". Model tests don't test custom methods.


## Scores
---------------------
Functional Expectations: 2
Active Record: 3
User Experience and Conventions: 3
Code Organization/Quality: 3
Testing: 2
Working Collaboratively: 3

## Feedback to Me

# Brandon

Hey Val!

I enjoyed working with you on Bikeshare. I was inspired by your willingness to spend extensive time on a project. You gave me a burst of energy to continue on our project when I would've usually tapped out at some time around 10pm. Your influence in a group project weighs heavily on the end results. You have an overall positive demenor and are very communicative. You were effective in delegating tasks, recognizing individual weaknesses and strengths and never portraid negativity under pressure. You were also never hesitant to give your input. Bottom line; I enjoy being aroud you. Thanks for the experience!

# Alex

Valerie,
It was great working with you on Bikeshare. I admired your work ethic and that you wanted to learn new concepts. You were always in a good mood which made working with you fun and relaxed. You also did a great job of laying the foundation for the styling of the project, and at a time when no one was really familiar with it. You were selected as the project manager and you should have done a better job of taking charge of the project and being the deciding voice to settle any decisions regarding the project. I enjoyed working with you, and I'm looking forward to pairing with you again.

# G

Valerie,

You are impressively determined, strong and so positive. Even in the hardest of time, you kept being enthusiastic and motivated us all to push through to finish as much as we could for our Bike Share project. I'm very happy that you were not afraid of voicing your opinions and visions from the moment the project started. It's very apparent how fascinated you are with programming and how much more you want to learn. I'm excited to see how far your passion will take you. It was a great pleasure working with you and I'm hoping we get paired again in the future!

# Casey

Valerie, it was so great working with you on this Little Shop. I hope you know what
a #GirlBoss you are, in general, but also when it comes to coding. I know that
you felt like your contributions weren't as much as others in our group, and I
felt the same way, but that doesn't mean that your contributions weren't extremely
beneficial to our project as a whole, especially in the home stretch when you
were a total wizard when it came to styling. I greatly appreciated your honesty throughout the project, and hope that you know how capable you are. Don't
underestimate and under sell your own abilities, you definitely know what you
are doing and it was such a pleasure working with you!

# Charolette

Valerie, it’s been really awesome having you on the Little Shop dream team. Thank you for coining that term for us. It’s clear from working with you that you have a really good understanding of what we’ve learned this mod. It was great pairing with you and working through issues we encountered in this project. I think, as we move forward you would benefit from writing tests before code. In mod 1 and at the beginning of this mod I was really resistant to TDD, but the more I embraced the process the easier it became to debug. I think some of the issues you encountered in this project could have been mitigated by this strategy. That said, I saw your testing improve a lot over this project. I think you have a strong conceptual and functional understanding of the MVC framework, and I think you’re really good at digging into issues. You were able to figure out some of the weirdest problems we ran into, for example embedding the link in the flash message. I enjoyed working with you, and I’m really happy with the application we built together.

# Courtney

Valerie, I really enjoyed working on the Little Shop project with you. I think your strengths were most obvious in the MVC structure and writing tests. You took on some of the most difficult features, such as the Admin-Orders dashboard. As a project member, I appreciate how you entertained everyone's ideas and asked questions that drove the development of our project. You were very communicative about what you were working on, and you consistently contributed high quality code to our application. In future projects, it might be helpful to advocate for what features you specifically want to work on to make sure that you're getting the learning experience you desire. Throughout Little Shop, you demonstrated tenacity and engagement in the development process. Your code reviews and questions asked during stand-ups made our code base stronger. I'm proud of the application we built together, and I look forward to working with you in the future.

## D: Professional Skills
- Tragedy of the Commons
- Debugging the Gender Gap
- Universal Basic Income

### Gear Up

#### Trajedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL]
(https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

Takeaways
---------------------

    What did you learn?
      Discrimination in the work place exists; its not just an outdated idea that doesn't exists. Woman experience harassment in their workplace and as a women I need to be aware of that possibility when going into the work place.
    What did you already know?
      I knew sexism existed and that men dominated the tech industry. I knew that I had to be okay with the possibility that my future work place might have very few women in it or worse non. Knowing this I need to make sure I extend myself more so to other minority groups that feel isolated so that they might feel at home away from their comfort zone
    What surprised you the most?
      I was surprised to hear about the github case - that there was only one woman their and she wasn't treated fairly while she was there/leaving.
    What do you agree/disagree with?
      I agree that there needs to be a change in the tech community, and I think this will change as tech will lead us into the future.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### Debugging the Gender Gap

*   [GitHub URL]
(https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

Takeaways
---------------------

  The documentary visited a topic that hardly discussed and widely experienced. The gender gap
  in the tech industry is a widely know phenomena and wasn't always present. It was intriguing to
  here real life examples of the consequences of such little numbers of woman in the tech. industry. I always understood
  that that would be an obstacle for me, my fellow woman, and other under represented groups, but to hear about it inside a
  company that I love is hard to hear and palpable. It's hard to hear, but necessary for change to occur. Woman were not always
  so under represented and in fact woman lead the innovations that we rely on today. It is important for for male and female to be
  cognizant of this gap and make an active effort to bridge it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### Universal Basic Income

*   [GitHub URL]
(https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

Takeaways
---------------------

    1. How would you describe the "realities" of our future economy? What constraints and opportunities will we face as a nation?

    2. What's your reaction to hearing tech leaders like Elon Musk describe UBI as a "foregone conclusion"?

    3. Write a quick elevator pitch synthesizing what you've read from these articles: what is UBI, why is it entering policy debates, what do you think people should know about automation and its affect on our workforce?

    4. Do you think it's worthwhile to be educated about automation, its affect on our workforce, and policy solutions like UBI? What does it look like to be a responsible citizen in the face of such a large, inevitable transformation? Do you think you can really have an impact -- if not, why put energy into being informed?

        I was the project manager for bike share, and during that project we used organization and open communication as guiding principles to keep us on track. To stay organized we used Waffle.io to keep track of all the needed tasks and to guide us daily on the work to be completed. We also communicated daily with checkin and stand ups at the beginning and end of group meetings or days where a good portion of work was done. Some things that didn't go well were git workflow, plan for what would happen when group members disagree, and using proper time management so that the project would be completed on time.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

# Brandon

  Brandon, I enjoyed working on bike share with you. We worked hard, and you really pulled us through the test portion of bike share. I see that you are a determined person; on the last night you showed that when you came back to work with us and it just showed me you really cared and were willing to stick it out. On future projects I would push for you to take on more. I think you underestimate yourself; you did a good job and you could gain a lot by diving in even if you don't feel comfortable. I look forward to working with you in future pairings.

# Alex

  Alex, you were great to work with on bike share. You worked as hard as I had hoped, you kept your cool during crunch time, and your easy to work with; having you on the team was a pleasure and I look forward to working together again. In future work, I think it would benefit you if you took on work that you are the least familiar with; although you did that a little bit with bike share, you should be conscious of it going in to a project. It was a pleasure working on a team with you; I'm very happy with the work we did.  

# G

  G, I love the personality that you bring to the table; its not just about work for you and that brings value to the team and I enjoyed having you as a team member. Although we didn't finish our bike share project you put in the effort and that is what is important. During our project we did have some down fall with the database; likely due to our lack of understanding. I'd say in the future to be cautious of what changes you are about to make only for the sake of trying to help someone. Perhaps, becoming more familiar with git and git workflow if you haven't already. Let it be noted that it is your spirit of helping others that got us into that predicament and at the end of the day that's the probably the best reason to have to go through so much trouble. You have a heart of gold and I love that about you.
# Casey

  Casey, your attitude is so positive and optimistic; it reminds me to be positive too; I'm so happy we were in a group together; you're a great person and a great team member. You actually were surprisingly on point even though we were away; it was as if you hadn't left. You also did a great job with striving to solve problems that I would have given up, think paperclip. I'm very proud of the work we did and I'm so happy to have worked with you. I hope we get to work together again in the future.

# Charolette

  Charolette, you're a great project manager, and a great team member; I really enjoyed having you as a teammate. Our project kicks ass I don't care how we score on it, and I can thank you and Courtney for that. You both were the back bone of the team, and I'm  unsure with out the both of you we would have done so well. This project felt the easiest to work through partly because it wasn't so difficult and partly because we all got along so well. Some food for thought: If ever in a project manager again and more so if you know the material decently; strive not exactly to get top scores on the project but to evenly divide the project responsibilities, and allow people room to struggle. Just for an example, I don't think I worked on a piece of the project by myself and instead of paired a lot with you. Albeit the testing part I asked for but then I never had a moment to struggle with a problem on my own. The only other piece of advice would be to be conscious of your driver/navigator habits; while we paired together everything went pretty smooth when I was driving and you were navigating; but when we switched you took on both navigator and driver. You're a great pairing partner to work with however; you kept a great attitude the whole time. I enjoyed that you took the time to celebrate the wins; it reminded me to lighten up and I really valued that. I hope I get the chance to work with you again.

# Courtney

Courtney, it was a pleasure to work with you; you are so thoughtful and considerate; and that's something I deeply admire about you. Our project kicks ass and you and Charolette held the team down the entire time. I love the focus and drive you have and they way that you can solve problems and break apart issues; I'm sure it will be something that serves you as you launch your career as a developer. I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate you caring and almost empathic character. I know you felt that I've had this internal struggle, and for you to take the time to care shows how great of a person you are. Keep that up, and keep up the drive and hunger to be better; you make me want to be a better - to-be - programmer. I always enjoy having you as a teammate; I hope we will continue to work together in the future.
