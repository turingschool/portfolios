## A: End of Module Assessment

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### API Curious

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/valerietrudell/Educreddit)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)

Description
--------------------

In this project, we’ll be focusing on consuming and working with data from public APIs.

As a vehicle for learning these concepts, we’ll be selecting an API from a popular website and working to re-construct a simplified version of the website’s existing UI using their own API. For example, you might decide to use the Twitter API to build a basic version of the Twitter feed where users can view and post tweets.

As we build these features, we’ll also be working with the OAuth protocol to authenticate our users with the third-party provider, and using various testing techniques to allow us to test against the third-party data.

#### Personal Project

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/valerietrudell/reddit-follows)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)

Description
--------------------

The goal of this project is to create a successful web application from a project idea. You will create an app that will authenticate with a third-party service, consume an api, and solve an actual problem.

Reddit-follows takes in a username and displays all of their comments. Also it displays a user's subscribed to subreddits.

    Learning Goals
    Technical Expectations
    Check-ins
    Evaluation


## Evaluation Notes
---------------------
Areas of improvements:
  - model test to include methods on the models
  - you could make a find controller for example and have index and show for find and find_all
  - make methods that are calling for a single record non class methods (take out self)
  - nest some resources in the routes under show (/customers/:id/...)
  - put ALL methods in the controller on the model

## Description
-----------------
In this project, you’ll be building a new platform from scratch to handle multiple types of users (guests, registered users & admins). You’ll build a new project assigned by the instructors. This is sometimes called “greenfield” development, because you are starting from scratch.

During this project, you will:

    Create a secure web application that supports multitenancy
    Create seed files

Depending on the project you choose and the requirements that develop, you may also:

    Allow users to upload files to your application
    Consume an external API
    Build an internal API
    Use JavaScript to access an API and/or update your page dynamically

## Feedback to Me
--------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Courtney -
Valerie, I really enjoyed working with you on the Cloney Island project. I appreciate that you took on the user dashboard, the calendar, and the trips system. Your code added a lot of functionality to our site. You added well tested code to our code base and did an excellent job setting up setting up the distinctions between trips and reservations. When you encountered problems, you pushed through and asked us for help as needed which made helped make sure that our project was on track to completion.You were an excellent team member, and any group would be lucky to have you on their team.

## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up

#### Microaggession

*   [GitHub URL]
    (https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

Takeaways
---------------------


    1. How have you experienced microagressions in your time at Turing or in your life?
    2. What ways have you been able to address microagressions that you have seen happen?
    3. What role could you play in interupting microagressions for others?



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### Grit
*   [GitHub URL]
    (https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

Takeaways
---------------------

    How did your grit come into play?
      Turing's assignment and project requirements are hard. Having grit is essential to survive, failure is not just a possibility, it will happen and in ways you least expect. In order to stay positive in the midst of the blatant failure you need to have grit firmly implanted in you.
    Have you been able to strengthen your grit (or your grittiness) in your time at Turing?
      This module, we had a mid-module assessment. I failed completely on this mid-mod; and at first I was really upset but I've had to step back, take a breathe and remember to have grit, and continue to apply myself.
    Is it in any way problematic to think about challenges through the lens of grit (ex: emphasizing pushing through when you really need a break)?
      There are times when you are faced with a seemingly impossible task or more so deadline for a task; and, in the spirit of grit, it is natural to want to push through, not take breaks, stay up very late, wake up very early; but in those times it is important to take a step back. If you don't take care of yourself, eat, sleep, drink water then you will just continue to be drained and your work will suffer from it; what normally would have taken you 2 hours to do will take you four and it will still might have mistakes in it.

    What parts of your experience at Turing has lit that fire?
      Most projects "lite a fire" so to speak for me. I enjoy working with apis or building databases, I think the only time it stops being
      that is when the deadline comes, far too soon, and I'm rushing just to complete the project and I'm not taking the time to enjoy the thing that I'm making and actually learning the concepts.  

    Brainstorm 4-5 descriptions of work that really engages you (algorithmically complex challenges, imagining user needs and creating something elegant and enjoyable to use, designing backend architecture to support open-ended specification).
      - bringing different tools together to crate a new thing that solves a need
      - security anything
      - using tools in way that they weren't made to be used. Think VM - make server - made VPN
      - building custom parts to lay on top of existing programs. Think plugins that encrypt traffic, or js scripts that make shooting lazers on top of a browser.

    How can you create opportunities to build around the work that engages you in your remaining time at Turing?
      - BoobTube - youtube red for free
      - make rasberri pie, interactive projector computer
      - VPN service
      - building a to-go shell - programs pre-built into a terminal that is all setup, comes with vpn/rotating proxies/dns - query modifier/macaddress spoffer
      - make a bluetooth typewritter keyboard
      - program to be loaded on vapes

*   Deliverables:
By the beginning of week 6, you should submit your Module 4 Job Search Action
Plan to Meg via the Career Development Submissions folder here

Takeaways
--------
Write: Spend five minutes analyzing your Flower Exercise and writing out a draft of who you are and what you're looking for.

Pair & Share: Pair up with someone else to share your draft. Your partner will repeat back to you what they heard you say in order to convey how clear this draft is. Make sure to ask each other questions if there is something you're unsure of in the summary. You'll then be able to go back and revise this draft of what you're looking for.

Extension: Having trouble with your resume and/or LinkedIn summaries? Workshop this summarized definition of who you are to revise your summaries for those tools. How might you incorporate your strengths into this summary as well?


Using your Flower Exercise, sketch out a list of things you'll be looking for in a job as a software developer. Then create two columns, labelled "Must-Have" and "Nice-To-Have":

If you could only have five of those things, which five would it be?
Move the rest to the "Nice-to-Have" list
If you could only have one of the things in your list of five, which would it be?
Prioritize based on how you narrowed it down and identify why they are prioritized in this order


Tips for sticking to your schedule:

Look at the schedule for Module 4, knowing that some projects may change but general deadlines will remain the same
Identify how many hours per week you can spend on job searching, even if it is only two hours per week
Block that time off on your calendar
Identify specific tasks to check off during that time based on weekly goals (see next step)
