# James Anderson - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For Module 1 I set out to build a strong foundation in Ruby. As a total beginner, it's important for me to build a solid understanding of not just the basics of Ruby but thinking like a developer. I also want to become comfortable using terminal and learn more hot keys. On the non-technical side, it's important that I break out of my shell and open up/build relationships with those in my cohort.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Working alone on projects has been a continuous learning process for me to grow confidence and rely on my own skillset.

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ande1618/linked_list)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

This project was an introduction to linked lists and nodes. It was incredibly draining and I spent an exorbitant amount of time just trying to wrap my head around the concept of linked lists.

22 tests all passing; keep up the testing
talked about instance variables and attr's
got through it 6
work on refactoring longer methods

1. Functional Expectations

3: Application fulfills all base expectations

2. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

2.5: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

5. Looping or Recursion

3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ande1618/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

For this project we were to design our own version of the classic board game using a REPL interface. We were instructed that we could not utilize pairings or other means of collaboration which created another challenging aspect. Being left to my own devices caused a few breakthroughs in the whiteboarding phase. However, unfortunately when it came time to lay down code my original plan began to fall apart as I jumped from class to class trying to build in missing parts.

Can place ships but no grid displays
Is going to work on implementing more by the time break is over

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

2. Enumerable & Collections

2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

3. Test-Driven Development

2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

4. REPL Interface

2: Application's REPL has some inconsistencies or rough edges

5. Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

6. Functional Expectations

2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Working in pairs has provided a very different dimension to programming. Driver/navigator is my preferred method to begin a project and I have now built enough confidence in myself and trust and others to be comfortable with the divide and conquer method.

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/blackknight75/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

This project was designed to use many intricate parts all working simultaneously encrypt, decrypt, and crack messages. An added complication was using the newly learned File I/O concept. As our first pair project it was a unique new dynamic. I was paired with Dan Olson who, as a repeater, had a much stronger understanding of the material.

17 tests, all pass
application successfully encrypts, decrypts, does not crack successfully
Some replication of code in encrypt/decrypt

1. Overall Functionality

2: Application is missing one of the three operations

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

3. Test-Driven Development

3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

4. Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

#### Head Count

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cmacaulay/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/headcount)
* DTR (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A2UncXTJozYl6GoNYY41jRmAjoxCPrb31OSDXv0hKBo/edit)
Assessed By: Beth Sebian

Repo: https://github.com/cmacaulay/headcount

Notes:

i0-4 running, 6 started
Really strong testing, some gaps, but altogether solid
Ruby style generally solid. Some opportunities for refactoring long methods and splitting into smaller methods (style and encapsulation issue)
Good use of enumerables
Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

1. Functional Expectations

2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes


2. Test-Driven Development

2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient


3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP


4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


5. Enumerable & Collections

4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods


6. Code Sanitation

The output from rake sanitation:all shows...

4: Zero complaints




## D: Professional Skills
I often focus on productivity and see soft skills as a variable in that function. However, knowing where to look for resources to improve those skills is usually quite difficult. These sessions are very rewarding and have opened my eyes to all sorts of different aspects of human interaction that I otherwise would probably have never found myself.

### Gear Up
#### Growth/Fixed Mindset

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

This was our first Gear Up and a welcome break from technical lessons. It was focused on the growth mindset which was an entirely new concept to me. Coming from a very negative atmosphere in my previous job, it was a drastic change to be in such a welcoming and positive environment. I was grouped with both front-end and back-end students and had a wonderful time discussing our backgrounds and how we can focus on staying in the growth mindset. It also gave me some time to reflect and jot down some goals I hope to accomplish both in Mod 1 and throughout my time at Turing.

#### Introversion/Extroversion

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

I found this Gear Up incredibly valuable. Firstly, it changed my entire view of the concept. It's much more than just being shy or outgoing. I have always considered myself somewhat of an ambivert (although I had never heard the term at the time) but after reading the article I realized I was much more of an introvert as I get my energy from solitude and introspection. We grouped with other liked-minded folks and it was very refreshing to realize you're not alone in your outlook. This also came at a very useful time coming off our first pair project. It's definitely something I will be including on my future DTRs.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding Part I

* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/personal_branding_p1)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-patrick-anderson
  https://github.com/ande1618/
  https://resume.creddle.io/resume/6woabnpfnu4)

It was very encouraging to be introduced to Allison and Meg this early on and know that Turing is serious about our professional development and continued success after the program. I find it incredibly difficult to paint my experiences in the best light because it's just my normal life to me. Because of that, I found swapping resumes and linkedin accounts useful because others gave me some areas to focus and expand on.

#### Learning to Pair: Define the Relationship and Hold Each Other Accountable

* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/learning_to_pair)

This was a workshop I didn't fully appreciate until after our first pair project. Getting along with people didn't seem worthy of a full class but afterwards I came to realize pairing is much more than that. Defining the relationship is an integral part of a successful project and while I got along great with my partner, I certainly spotted some areas I need to improve upon and will be going much more in depth in my DTRs in the future.

#### Feedback I

* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/feedback_1)

This was an incredibly important session to help us frame how to give feedback. The so-called "shit sandwich" is a wonderful way to focus on the positive as well as areas for improvement. It was helpful to be reminded that feedback is not a character assassination, if done correctly it should be a very constructive exchange.

#### Personal Branding II

* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/personal_branding_p2)
This workshop will be valuable in the future. A personal website is not something I would've taken the initiative to do myself had it not been brought to the foreground in this session. Getting to see two very differing examples of developers' websites was a great starting point. It also brought in work from our first PB session which was a nice progression.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback


@ Dan Olson - "Thank you for your hard work. You are very proactive and easy to get along with.
I would also venture to say you are one of the strongest students in the class. This puts you in a unique position for a Mod 1 student to be both teacher and student. Additionally, it means that you will most likely have equal or stronger ability than most of your partners this mod so I would encourage you to slow down, relinquish the keyboard, and focus more on navigating and sharing your knowledge while still listening to your partners' suggestions. Working on screenhero with you was also a cool new experience for me but I would remind you that your partner can only see what's on your screen so being more vocal as you whiteboard would be helpful. That being said, whiteboarding with you is kick-ass because you are very good at breaking problems down into manageable chunks and descriptive diagrams. You're light-hearted nature made what could've been a daunting project into a fun learning experience."

@ Casey MacCaulay - "Working with you has been an absolute pleasure. I'm very pleased with how things went. We meshed well and worked hard but still had some laughs. Your drive is incredible and infectious. Just, as was already made apparent this week, make sure you get enough sleep and take some breaks! I have learned a lot from you. You are a .merge master and your knowledge of hashes has been a great learning resource for me. Be proud of the work, I know I am. I think both of us made great strides in our learning and that would not have been possible without a great partner. Look forward to our next one together."

@ Max Glassey - "Since sitting next to you on day 1, you've been a great confidant and valuable member of our cohort. After strengths finder I realized you and I have similar approaches on things and the questions you often pose in class are ones that I usually also have. You have approached sticky situations in a professional and dignified manner and your hunger for knowledge is always apparent. You provide much needed comic releif but are clearly a hardworker. I look forward to pairing with you in the future."

### Being a Community Member

"First of all I want to commend you for being an awesome partner. I feel that both of us having families and dealing with the struggles of managing those things while going to school was a topic we could always talk and share on. This open communication flowed into our project and allowed us to make a plan of action for what we wanted to accomplish. We were able to break the project down into pieces so that we could focus on one thing and collectively push forward on that. We did struggle at points but we kept our composure and followed our errors so that we could troubleshoot them effectively. I was especially impressed with your progression with identifying syntax errors that might have derailed us for X amount of time. Other things that we struggled with were the sharing of responsibility and driving time on the keyboard. I feel that part of this issue was with my asserting control and wanting to push forward. I should have done better at checking in with you for understanding. On the other hand, I would have liked to see you stop me more and point out specific things you don’t understand or why I might have done something a certain way as opposed another way. This would give me clarification on what I need to give you so that we can both move forward together and we have a mutual understanding of the work we did. Also, I think we both could do a better job reading the markdown and making sure we are executing the program properly from the start. On the other hand, you have a much better understanding of classes and how to access elements in those classes. You might not feel like you contributed a lot but the reality is that you saved us a lot of time when caught errors or when you figured out the missing link to our “crack” issue. You know a lot more than you think you do and I saw progression in your understanding from start to finish. By the end you were able to take the project and write tests on your own and have a pretty good idea where things are coming from. Thank you again for crushing Enigma with me and I look forward to collaborating with you in the future." -Dan Olson

"I really enjoyed working with you James. At the start of the project you definitely showed hesitation, but I knew that you had the content knowledge. After the final assessment it was clear that you received the injection of confidence that you needed, and it led to you producing at much higher levels. Trust your own knowledge going into next projects! Your voice of reason helped us from going down too many rabbit holes. I'm so impressed that you were able to figure out how to use a module, and at your prowess with boolean statements. Looking forward to working with you again in future mods!" -Casey MacCaulay

"James - I’ve enjoyed getting to know you better. We have similar perspectives from having lived overseas. I admire how you’ve been so supportive of others in our cohort and your own personal dedication to learning the material. I’ve seen you grow in response to the significant challenges of the program at Turing. I’m also grateful to be able to rely on you as a supportive friend with a great sense of humor. You’ve got a clear passion for intellectual growth and I look forward to working with you in the future." -Max Glassey

### Playing a Part

I have spent many long hours in the basement getting to know lots of different people who were very gracious with their assistance. David Mauer has been a great resource giving some much of his time on weekends with mythical creatures walkthroughs and final assessment prep (remotely). I've paired with Kris Sparks on numerous occaisions and had the opportunity to pair with five different Mod 2 students. Lunch roulette has been an interesting and fun way to mix with other mods and front end students and since our SAB members instigated Mod 1 Monday lunches, I think its helped our cohort gel well. Outside of the Blakement a number of us have had the chance to celebrate our project completion week-by-week as well. I feel that as a group/cohort, we have really grown together.
