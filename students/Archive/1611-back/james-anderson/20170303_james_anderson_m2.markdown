# James Anderson - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
For Mod 2 I set out to continue building on my Mod 1 knowledge. I was under the impression that Mod 2 would be front end heavy and knew very little about the actual curriculum so what few goals I had set quickly became irrelevant.
However, I am most proud of my progress using github and general workflow in groups. Since my lackluster mid-mod performance, I've tried much harder to let testing drive my development and in doing so have gotten much better at knowing what errors to expect and debugging, though I would say 'save_and_open_page' is my new favorite tool.

## Rubric Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3

* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment
1. Conceptual Understanding

  * 3: Developer is able to describe concepts with a moderately high degree of specificity and accuracy with some assistance/questioning
 
2. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

  * 3.5: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them with little assistance

3. Feature Completeness

  * 3: Developer is able to implement all functionality and all tests pass

4. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style

  * 3: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods with minimal support and understands the relationship between models and the database

5. Rails Style

  * 3.5: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

6. Testing

  * 3.5: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may need some assistance

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The guided discovery and tutorial approach has been extremely effective for me. I think the repetitive nature of our assignments has gone a long way to help me solidify my understanding and retention of the topics covered.

Mix Master - This project provided a bit more support and hand holding which was very helpful in the earlier days. It gave me much needed practice using many to many relationships and helped solidify my CRUD-ing. It was also my first foray into FactoryGirl which I can say with absolute certainty that I will never be using again on freewill. This project was rewarding in that it was that first that was actually deployed to Heroku which gave us some tangible feedback. I was also intrigued to get a first taste of OAuth and how it worked, which I was totally clueless about before.

Giphy Generator (Mini Project) - This project I am quite proud of because it's the first fully functioning solo project I've completed since Jungle Beats. Coming off of a group project and tutorials I was eager to stretch my legs and see just how well I could produce. Unfortunately, while trying to implement Materialize I got in over my head trying to use JS for dropdown menus so it's still a pretty vanilla work-of-art. Nevertheless, it was a learning experience that turned out to be a fun app and I got a rather convulsive introduction into APIs.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects


#### Bike Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ande1618/bike_share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

Bike Share was our first group project which provided a whole new dimension. The idea of version control and using GitHub effectively got real, quick. I lucked out with a group that worked very well together. We took a rather linear approach, dividing tasks up in pairs. This gave us all a chance to work with one-another and made sure everyone was getting reps on all the different pieces of functionality. There was no shortage of "oh shit" moments and having to reseed an entire city's trip data gave us plenty of opportunities to take a walk. Additionally, I don't believe I'll ever forget to run 'rake db:test:prepare' again and I feel pretty confident in my migratory skills after running some 3-4 dozen migrations. In the end, I think all of us learned a lot, suffered a little, and are quite proud of the project we built.

1. Functional Expectations

2: Application has some small missing base functionality

2. ActiveRecord

3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

3. User Experience and Conventions

3: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.

4. Code Organization/Quality

3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/responses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

5. Testing

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

6. Working Collaboratively

3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alfosco/pog_hogs)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

Little Shop has been, by far, the most fun project to-date. Creating something that you can show off and that is potentially usable (should pogs come back into fashion) is very rewarding. I think the biggest change that I've noticed is that I am quite confident in what I'm doing now and find it difficult to peel myself away from the keys at night. Going from a diffident Mod 1 student who was nervous to work in any scenario that wasn't driver-navigator to a group member who is perfectly happy to crush user stories via divide and conquer has been a large stride for me. I've also thoroughly enjoyed the more life-like client check-in approach and the chance to use a little more creativity in designing and building our app.

## D: Professional Skills

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Project Management Strategies

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/agile_practices_project_management.md)
This was an interesting session from a technical perspective as I'd never heard of the waterfall model nor the agile manifesto and putting forth the least viable product. From a practical perspective, my groups have gotten a lot of mileage out of the topics and tools presented. Using GitHub effectively has been my main priority this mod after seeing its power in action (also lit a fire after Carmer mentioned it's currently the most sought after skill). Being able to comment on code, pull request for feedback and maintain a viable working master while still in production is monumental especially as our groups weren't always in the same room anymore. Waffle is another organizational tool that I've come to love. There's nothing more rewarding than swiping a user story over to completed. From an interpersonal point of view, my first team agreed early on that Project Manager was a token position and that we would be completing the project as equals. If there was a problem (which never came to fruition), than there would be a group intervention. We operated in pairs and let everyone voice their concern as to what piece of functionality they would prefer to work on. My second group was a trio as has largely functioned as a divide-and-conquer dynamic. I believe this has been somewhat necessitated by having one less member, increased skill level, and outside workload (studying for final assessments and this portfolio). The method has certainly had its pitfalls as members get stuck and do not voice their concerns early enough but keeping a solid workflow through GitHub and Waffle, and regular check-ins have helped mitigate negative repercussions.

#### Feedback II

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/feedback_ii.md)
The Johari window exercise was an enlightening one. Judging by some of the reactions, I would say it was a rather unpleasant, albeit necessary task for some. It was good to get unbiased feedback. Some of the traits I received I found rather surprising. For example, I would describe myself as rather cynical in nature so I was a bit taken aback to find 3 of 5 people described me as positive. I also consider myself quite organized and driven which was only observed by one. I think it was a healthy dose of reality.

#### StengthsFinder-Johari Window
The StrengthsFinder session gave us an opportunity to discuss our Johari window results with those who provided the feedback. I was pleased overall with my results and not overly surprised by any of the responses. Nonetheless, I think it gave many an opportunity to clear the air and while most of my groups and pairings have been harmonious, we discussed what we could've done better as team members. I also found out that I was considered positive in large part because I don't not get defeated easily, which was a refreshing clarification. In addition, I learned some interesting tid-bits about my cohort-members as we got the chance to share what we had put down in our secret-window part of the exercise. I think an over-arching theme from the exercise though is that most of us harder on ourselves than others.

#### Plan for reaching out to a mentor
During the intermission week I plan to reach out to a few different possible mentors. I've made a shortlist of 5 from the current list. I'm looking for someone who has a similar profile to myself such as a Turing grad, family, and preferably local but not necessary. It's important to me that I find someone that I can bounce questions off of regarding jobs and the industry in general more so than technical inquiries. I mainly looking for someone who has been in my shoes and can offer advice and guidance getting off the ground as a developer.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

@ Jonathan Serrano
Your testing proficiency is second to none. Between writing scores of tests and fixing dozens more that were failing, I think you have a firm grasp on that. You also managed to squeeze in front ending which made our app pretty slick. In the future I think it would be beneficial for you to practice more pair programming as it seems you are more comfortable working alone. Aside from that, you also did a great job of keeping momentum up. While the rest of us would get stuck on granular tasks, you would show up the next day with a whole slew of new improvements. I think we all meshed really well and I'm very proud of the headway the four of us made in skill level and the work we produced. Looking forward to the next time we get paired together.

@ Spencer Carter
Working with you has been a trip. I think you were successful in your goal of stepping back from a leadership role. You paired with everyone on different tasks and from my point of view, were very easy to work with. You were communicative while you were navigating and made sure to share ample time on the keyboard. In the future, I'd like to see you come in with more confidence in your ability. Do not let the transition from M1 to M2 faze you, you are a competent programmer. I also think it would have been beneficial to practice a code freeze once the project was within a 10 hour window. I think we all meshed really well and I'm very proud of the headway the four of us made in skill level and the work we produced. Looking forward to the next time we get paired together.

@ Andy Wooten
You did a great job anchoring the group. You were very good about reaching out to others outside the group for advice and getting us over hurdles that held us up for hours (i.e. trip data). In the future, make sure to give your team very clear updates about any monumental changes or progress you've made. Also, take others' working/personality styles into account. Some people need to work in silence on occasion or completely unplug from project related conversation for a breather. Your overwhelming positivity is a force to be reckoned with and your courteousness is refreshing. You are always ready and willing to add a helping hand. I think we all meshed really well and I'm very proud of the headway that the four of us made in skill level and the work we produced. Looking forward to the next time we get paired together.

@ Ryan Spink
You've been a huge asset in our cohort. Your strong leadership abilities have shown through as our SAB rep. I think you have done really well at hearing our concerns and voicing them to the faculty. You've also been a great resource for bouncing ideas off of during projects and I look forward to working with you in the future.

### Being a Community Member

James, I had a blast getting to work with you on Bikeshare.  I really appreciated how clearly communicated throughout the project.  You readily brought up concerns you had about the direction of the project; furthermore, you directly communicated the pieces of the project that you were interested in working on when they were available.  Your dedication and drive were readily evident in how focused you were when working.  I also respect how quick you were to pair with someone to work through a problem.  The only thing that I would encourage you to do in the future is verbalize more quickly when you need a break from work; I respect that we all need time to unwind, and I think it would help your groups in the future for you to assert that you have that need.  I hope we get to work together in the future. It was a great experience. -Andy Wooten

James,
Thank you for being one of the members of the "DreamTeam" for Bikeshare! Working with you did not even feel like work, more simply getting tasks done and moving on. I want to commend you for the growth I have seen since we first talked in Mod1. You were an all-star in the group not only with coding, but also with your level headedness at all times! Your biggest area of growth would be communication within a pairing. I could see the Eureka happen in your head, but wouldn't always get an explanation of what/why. I understand not wanting to lose that thought and needing to get it typed out ASAP, but a brief explanation of how that idea came to fruition while you type could help your partner out. I will try to emulate your work style from here on out, as you knew when to grind, and when to rest. You were a phenomenal teammate and I look forward to working with you again! -Spencer Carter

James,
While the rest of us took the first night off from the project you took it upon yourself to create CRUD functionality for the Station objects, now that is determination. If a task needed to be done and the rest of us hesitated at picking it up, you took the lead on it. While I do value your approach, I would like to see you take a bigger leadership role. Going back to doing tasks that needed to be done, next project, I would advice that you choose what you want to work on the most even if it doesn't matter what you work on. There is a positive leadership value even in a small step like the one mentioned. On the other hand, thanks for taking care of the Waffle board, it helped out a lot in knowing what had been accomplished and what needed work.Thanks for being a helpful, well-rounded and informative partner. -Jonathan Serrano

James, while we haven’t worked together on a project, we have used each other as a resource to review code and work through problems together.  You have valuable insight and are always willing to help when anyone in our mod asks for it. Outside of Turing, you spearhead inclusive social meetups that have directly contributed to our cohort cohesiveness. I look forward to working with you in Mod3! -Ryan Spink

### Gear Up

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
This Gear Up gave us a fun, interactive approach to a serious topic that is not oft talked about. The writeup made some valid points about how Individual bias, or just a nonchalance to integration, can lead to collective bias. Our follow-up discussion lead to some pretty strong arguments both for and against diversity quotas. Unfortunately, we didn't get as much time to discuss as we would've liked but whether mandated or not, our group came to the conclusion that interaction with those from different walks of life was the most powerful tool for battling collective bias. 

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)
This was one of the best documentaries I've seen in some time. Unfortunately, I didn't take great notes because I was enthralled with the video but some of the stories were both fascinating and shocking. However, the first story that sticks out in my mind was the loss of life due to airbags that were created to spec of the team members, who were all men. This reminded me of Facebook's scandal with the autoplaying, year-end review video that featured a couple's recently deceased son. Both were problems that could have been avoided had they had a more user-representative team of developers. The other story that sticks out in my mind was that of the "Git Queen." It was pretty appalling to hear the abuses she endured. Sadly, tech gives users a veil of anonymity to say vicious things that would otherwise never be spoken but the fact that she, and the new tenants in her apartment, faced physical violence after someone posted her address online is atrocious. I also jotted the link for Kodable to get my son started on. I will say the discussion was a bit anticlimactic as I was in an entirely male group.

#### Universal Basic Income

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)
This Gear Up delved into a topic that I wasn't very familiar with. The articles were interesting and our follow-up conversation brought up some interesting points. We discussed how universal basic income doesn't necessarily need to be tied to automation, that it is something that should be further explored today. The idea of a basic income is an enticing one given the soaring costs of living and stagnating salaries. Some of the hurdles that were brought up were funding such a scheme, the US's historically anti-social-program nature in recent years, and whether the policy would be governed at a local or federal level. In response to automation, we also elaborated on the need for vocational education for those whose jobs were becoming defunct. However, I will say that our conversation took on a markedly political nature which I found off-putting.
