# Eric Wahlgren-Sauro - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out this module to gain mastery over taking larger problems, breaking them down into manageable pieces, and executing well. Crowd-Funder served as an opportunity to meet this goal. Additionally, I aimed to position myself so that by the end of the module I was ready for job applications. I've shadowed at four companies and feel ready to start my applications.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment
  Like the assertions against keys in your service spec.
  Seems unnecessary to create two items in your API create spec.
  Would like to see some assertion about Item.count in the API delete spec.
  Model spec looks good. Consider stubbing out the service.
  Feature test looks good.
  16 Total stores is hard coded in your view. Should be dynamic based on what the API returns.
  Don't need to save `params[:search]` to an instance variable in your controller if you're not going to use it in the view.
  Model looks clean. Why have a default value for attrs? Is there value to a store that gets initialized with no attributes? Should that error instead?
  Consider breaking out Faraday call between `.new` and `#get`. Will require you to include the default adapter.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

API Curious & Commute-Tracker

#### API Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cews7/facebook-api)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)

*This application uses the Omniauth gem for handling OAuth protocol. I used Facebook as the provider. This application hits multiple endpoints offered by the Facebook Graph API.*

#### Commute-Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cews7/commute-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)

*The mission of this application is to provide annual commute times based on input addresses given by the user. The general use case is when considering where I'd like to live after getting hired, I want to know approximately how much time per year I can expect to be behind the wheel of a car. This project was fun once it got underway, but I had difficulty making headway the first week, as I was continually unclear in what I was building and how I wanted to display its contents. I'm proud that I was able to get something working, despite not having the clearest direction of where I wanted to take the application. Lastly, this project proved to me in a big way that I'm at a point with my skills so as to be able to take a person's idea and tease it out into existence with software.*

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Rales-Engine & Crowd-Funder

#### Rales-Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/blackknight75/rails-engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

*The focus of this project was to learn how to build an API in Rails while operating with RESTful principles.*

**Students: Dan, Eric**

**Evaluated by: Meeka**

**1. Completion**

* 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.

**1. Test-Driven Development**   

* 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

**2. Code Quality**

* 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

**3. API Design**

* 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

**4. Queries**

* 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.

#### Cloney-Island

* [Assessment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1611-b/3module/cloney_island/kickstarter.md)

* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)

*The focus of this project was to replicate as much functionality as possible from a given, real-world, application.*

## D: Professional Skills
Gear Up & Professional Development

### Gear Up
#### Micro-Agressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

This session focused on what micro-aggressions are, where we experience them, and how we've been impacted. I take these opportunities to play listener, as I don't see what merits using collectively hundreds of hours investigating this SJW cause within the walls of Turing. My opinion on this topic is there are bigger issues to worry about. With that said, I appreciate Turing's mission of on-boarding a diverse set of programmers.

#### Grit

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

Our focus for this session was to better understand how grit has played a role during our time at Turing. The session was a repeat for module three students, but I still enjoyed getting to participate with module one students around the topic. By listening to a module one student's experience it gave me perspective for how far I've come since I began at Turing.

#### Automation

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

The focus of this lesson was on how robots will have an impact on our lives going forward in the economy, workforce, and civil life. The content being the same was mildly obnoxious, but I enjoyed getting the chance to hear what my group members had to say on the topic. I am intimately familiar with the subject, so I made of point of making sure others shared out as much information as possible before sharing my own thoughts. The session could have benefited from more discussion behind the ethics of AI, but nevertheless, I walked away with a fire under my butt to make sure after Turing I continue to go deeper into Python.


### Professional Development

## E: Feedback

### Feedback to Team Members

#### Dan Olson

* *Dan and I work well together. Instead of our OC tendencies for quality code getting on each others nerves, we embrace it. Our git workflow was solid. I felt comfortable working remotely, using PR comments as a formal trail of breadcrumbs for explaining our thoughts to each other. After we finished the project, Dan and I explored upcoming material giving the opportunity to further refine my thought process on consuming APIs. Dan is a good guy and works hard for excellent results. A couple times during the project I thought he was mad with me, but I think that was just a bit of stress coming through.*

#### Charlotte

* *When the module first started, I heard people calling her "gem Charlotte" and now I know why. Not only is she the most capable developer I've encountered at Turing, she is an outstanding PM. She let the group take on it's own rhythm and consequently we all performed better than average. I grew as a developer through pairing with her on several user stories and am thankful to have her in 1611.*

#### Spencer

* *Spencer says what he thinks, I like that. He focuses on getting the task done and isn't bothered by asking questions if he hits a roadblock. He was awesome about time-boxing problems and making sure all teammates were on the same page before diving into the work of each day. His high energy and frank demeanor served as assets to our team.*

#### G

* *G and I have become good friends at Turing. Consequently, we know each others blind spots. This is a helpful benefit when on a team with people you don't know. She'd feel comfortable to call me on my shit and I could call her on her's. We spent many hours back-to-back solving problems and building features. Working with her reminders me of how far our skills have come since module one.*

### Feedback from Team Members

#### Charlotte

* *Eric,
It was awesome working with and getting to know you. I learned a lot about how to communicate from pairing with you. You pick up new concepts really quickly, but I think it can take some time for you to work through nuances of new information and become comfortable applying it. That said, I think that's something that comes with experience and I foresee your skills improving immensely over time. I’m glad I got the chance to work with you and I’m really happy with the application we were able to create.*

#### G

* *I'm so happy that we were able to work together on a project again. Working in a group project can be sometimes stressful but working with a friend like you makes things easier. I will always appreciate your desire to help me grow and your honesty. Thank you for being such a good friend and for always calling me on my flaws.*


### Playing a Part

I hosted a spike session on Bash with Charlotte, James, and G. No one showed up, but we did put together a kick-ass curriculum.
