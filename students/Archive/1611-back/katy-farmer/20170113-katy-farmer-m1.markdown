# Katy Farmer Module 1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I didn't have a specific goal at the beginning of the module because I
wasn't sure what to expect. I wanted to focus on thinking like a developer, in
that I wanted to approach problems from a new perspective that involved breaking
down problems smaller and viewing large problems as no different than a few small
ones.

## Rubric Scores

#### Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods



## B: Individual Work & Projects

I feel like I made huge improvements between Date Night and Complete Me in terms of
understanding recursion and the architecture of a search tree. I finally started
really understanding what was going on just as the end of Complete Me. I really enjoyed
making Battleship because there was a fun interface and I learned new things as I needed them.


### *Date Night*

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TheKaterTot/binary_tree)
* [Original Assignment]()

Create a binary search tree to store movies and their scores.

- Wasn't able to get the tree running

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group work can be a challenge for me, as I have been working on my own for the past
five years. I'm working on being a better listener so that my partner always feels
heard and valued. I'm learning to like working in pairs as I get better at managing
those relationships.

### *Complete_Me*

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/valerietrudell/Complete_Me)

Create a program that works to autocomplete text.

Nate got distracted by trying to refactor an elsif, but doesn't have any judgements to bring upon this code

##### Functional Expectations

*  3: Application fulfills all base expectations

##### Test-Driven Development

*  4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

##### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

*  4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

##### Fundamental Ruby & Style

*  3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### Enumerable & Collections

*  4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

### *Headcount*

Assessed By: Beth Sebian

Repo: https://github.com/TheKaterTot/headcount
Description: Write a program that works to access data at different levels.

Notes:

Passing through i5, with exception of a compellingly contested i5 spec harness test
Solid, clear testing -- some opportunities to test more edge cases and verify desired functionality
Overall solid style and encapsulation, some opportunities to refactor large methods
Badass enumerables
0 sanitation
Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

##### Functional Expectations

*  3: Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 as well as one of Iterations 5 or 6

##### Test-Driven Development

*  3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

*  3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### Fundamental Ruby & Style

*  3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### Enumerable & Collections

*  4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

##### Code Sanitation

The output from rake sanitation:all shows...

*  4: Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

It took a few days for growth mindset to start to mean something to me. I
understood the idea, but I didn't quite grasp how to apply it. I can feel
when I am in a fixed mindset, but I don't always feel capable of pulling myself
out of that and into a growth mindset. I am trying to be more self-aware and
more objective about my behavior and mindset so that I can find the best
opportunities to apply this. I want to learn all of the time, so I hope that
I can use this to promote self-learning, whether academic or emotion, more often.  

#### Growth Mindset Part 2--Introvert/Extrovert

I still think it is hard to pick a side of the spectrum. Most days, I am very
extroverted, and I get energy from being around people. However, due to the
nature of my history with depression and anxiety, some days all I want is to be
alone. Understanding how this can be beneficial to me is really important to me.
I have been told that I am intimidating more than once in my life, and while I
don't like that term, I also do not want to become less of myself for the sake of
someone else. I'm learning how to hear that I need to slow down or leave more
room for people to talk (a goal I set with Allison), but need to set the boundary
between compromising for the sake of teamwork and compromising because someone
isn't comfortable with me being me.

#### Grit
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown

My definition of grit has always sided more with perseverance than passion. I learned about grit as a way to cope and force myself to move forward as a kid. It was a quality that almost everyone I knew respected, but it just meant toughness, even when that toughness was unwarranted or unnecessary. I like the idea of differentiating between determination and grit. At Turing, I don’t know that I’ve ever thought of giving up. I had to make sacrifices to come here in the first place, so my motivation is firmly seated. I fail and I write bad code, but I trust my ability to improve. I do tend to push through even when I need a break, and I’ve been working on that during my current project. I’m trying to ask for help instead of suffering for hours.

Growth mindset has to more to do with my intellectual approach, and grit has to do with my emotional approach. Growth mindset helps me realize that I can be looking for opportunities in failure and adapting my learning style. Grit helps me actually make change and improve. They feel naturally connected because grit without growth mindset can mean pure perseverance, and growth mindset without grit can lead to too much introspection without action.



### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Personal Branding Part I)

* [Workshop URL]()
https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md
* [Link to Completed Deliverables]()
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aDH6kNvPgb6iv-ILD36c81nvwkKIxLphuElAbPL8o9k/edit?usp=sharing
https://www.linkedin.com/in/katyfarmer460

I struggled with the assignments because I didn't know how to build a resume
for skills I don't have yet. I've also never utilized LinkedIn for anything
useful before, so I wasn't sure how to write for that kind of profile. I just received
my feedback from Meg (1/4/17), so I'll be working on updating both assignments.

#### (Learning to Pair)

I wrote a rough draft of web copy for my personal site in my notebook.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

For Valerie on CompleteMe: I really appreciated how you pushed me to step back when we were stuck, and offered different perspectives to every problem. Your ability to be calm helped me when I felt frustrated. It was sometimes difficult for you to stay on task when we had been working all day, but I appreciated that you kept a positive attitude. I felt your ability to ask a lot of questions helped us hone in on mistakes and refactor effectively. I think it would be a good idea to limit internet browsing during whiteboarding in order to get the most out of that time. You were always flexible and easy to work with, which made our project goals feel more attainable.



### Being a Community Member

From Jonathan on Headcount: Katy, I want to start off by thanking you for being an outgoing friendly person. Since day one you have been nothing but cheerful, your attitude has made each and every morning in the Blakesment that much better. Your attitude is only matched by your desire to learn, it is something that I personaly admire. You are the definition of Grit and Passion, seeing you work has made me strive to be the best version of myself and that is something that I have to thank you for. Turing, the students and staff are lucky to have such a talented person as yourself, keep up the positive vibes and determination, I expect nothing but success from you.

### Playing a Part

I tried to be available to my peers for questions whenever I could be helpful,
and even sometimes when I couldn't. I didn't have much time for posses, but I
enjoyed supporting people in my cohort, either academically or emotionally.
