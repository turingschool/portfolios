# (Ryan Spink) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

 - I had one overarching goal this mod, the same as last mod: learn as much as I possibly can while working as hard as I can. I believe that for the most part I accomplished this goal. From the beginning of the mod until the end I threw myself at my work and was constantly trying to improve myself in every aspect of being a software dev. As I've mentioned to both instructors, I'm truly having a blast at this point in Turing. I think one of the biggest pieces of this is that my enjoyment for learning software development right now really validates my decision to drop a career to pursue this dream. It would seem I couldn't have made a better decision. Looking forward, I want to continue to sponge as much knowledge and gain as much development experience as I can while continuing to play a part in the Turing community.

3. Feature Completeness
  * 4: Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests
4. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style
  * 3: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods with minimal support and understands the relationship between models and the database
5. Rails Style
  * 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack
6. Testing
  * 3.5: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may need some assistance parsing errors or prioritizing next steps
7. Collaboration
  * 3.5: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process
  
 My final assessment feedback included hammering in moving AR back to the model immediately as it was being rewritten. On a personal note, I worked to include shortcuts in my coding approach and I think that’s reflected in the speed at which I completed the final. 

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### (Mix Master)
*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ryanspink1/mix_master)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mix_master/1_getting_started)
-	This project is great. Really in-depth, lots of associations, lots of testing, a fair amount of stuff we hadn’t seen before…love it. I feel that I really learned a lot on this project. While it is lengthy, the tutorial is highly enjoyable from a learning standpoint. I don’t normally need someone to hold my hand, and while all the answers were available and it was a tutorial, it didn’t feel that way. I would definitely keep this project around and it’s probably one of the biggest catalysts for my growth in Rails this Mod.

#### (Rails Mini Project)
*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ryanspink1/PointBox)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)
-	I’m a little bit at a loss of what to say about this project. We were given easily twice amount of time needed to complete this project, yet mine still didn’t look that great. I felt uninspired on this project, and I think it shows.  While the functionality is almost all there, I don’t feel proud of this work. I think I was pretty salty that so much time was taken away from in class learning to give us time to work on this. I used most of the in-class time that was given to us to complete this project to study instead, as I felt that it provided more of a challenge and greater benefit than this project. I really hate to sound snarky, but RMP was probably the worst I felt about any work I did this Mod. I always try to work hard, and I felt that I was really missing out on what could have been valuable in-class sessions. This is in no way a knock on the instructors. I think you guys have done a fantastic job this mod. My only real feedback would be to cut the time on this project and devote more time during the day to lessons. I might be in the minority there, but that’s just my perspective. Happy to flesh this out with either Sal or Andrew if they have any questions about it. 

#### (Blog Post)
- I recently learned about the basics of artifical neural networks while researching for a lightning talk at Turing. It is fascinating to see how these complex software connections are created, used, and are literally everywhere in our modern high-tech world. An artificial neural network is a simulation of how neruons in the brain, en masse, interact with each other to make decisions. They consist of units that are separated into input, hidden, and output functions. Input units receive info and pass them along to hidden units via connections called weights. Weights modify the information being passed and the accumulation of data at the next unit will either fire or not depending on the value of the information that they've received. This progresses until the information reaches the output units, where the modified information is presented to the user. Neural networks "learn" by backpropogation, or through feedback being sent backwards through the output units to modify the weights between the hidden units. This effectively teaches the artificial network to produces a desired outcome. The network is then used on a completely new dataset to see how effective it is at identifying correlations within it and the feedback process begins again. Neural networks are in everything from cellphones to airplane autopilots. They help build software for abstract situations like self-driving cars and giving a robot responsibilities to make descisions based on a continually changing surrounding environment. I will continue to research this topic, and hope to progress my knowledge to a point of better understanding more of it's complexities. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### (Bike Share)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ryanspink1/bike-share)
*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

 In bike share, we were tasked with creating a database to store CSV information about a bike share business in California. It was a great introduction to the server-side of things (routes, Active Record) in a "deployable" manner. I think that our group worked incredibly well together. We had a "get shit done, without sacrificing quality" mindset and we stuck to it. We hashed differences out like adults and were self-aware in our interactions with each other. We supported each others individual delegations while still maintining the effectiveness of individual workflow. In the end, we produced a great project and learned immensely in the process. 

Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Functional Expectations

  3: Application fulfills base expectations

2. ActiveRecord

  3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

3. User Experience and Conventions

  3.5: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.

4. Code Organization/Quality

  3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

5. Testing

  4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

6. Working Collaboratively

  3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

- Feedback from Charlotte Moore:
 - Ryan, working with you on Bike-Share was really fun. I observed that you have a keen eye for debugging and you pick up on new concepts very quickly. I learned a lot about how to communicate from pairing with you, and I think it really helped me grow as a coder. I know Ashley and I butted heads a bit during this project, and you always maintained a cool head when things got heated. I think this project could have benefited from you taking more of a leadership role, as I think you had a lot of good ideas. Ultimately I think we all figured out how to work together, and the initial communication issues stopped as we fell into a good workflow. I really enjoyed working with you, and I’m happy with how this project turned out.

#### (Little Shop of Orders: Abandoned Camel Coffee Mercantile)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/codyborders/abandoned_camel_coffee_mercantile)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

 This project has easily been the most enjoyable of the Mod. We were tasked with creating our own e-commerce server, which we molded into a coffee bean retailer. It has been a pleasure to continue my professional growth as a member of a well functioning team. Furthermore, the more real-world scenario of customer-client interactions has been interesting and a great primer. I have really taken the TDD approach to heart with this project and being rewarding with a smooth, enjoyable software development experience. I'm excited to finish the project out and see how it ends up!

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Tragedy of Commons)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

 I found this session very interesting. Coming from an accounting background that, to me, seemed fairly diverse it's been quite a change being presented with a tech social education. The parabable of the polygons was an intriguing way to present the case for how small micro-stereotypes and views leading to large consequences when held en masse. According to PotP, this leads to segregation. While I found the session engaging, I would have liked to see more empirical evidence support some of the vast assertions that were being made. I'm in no way discounting it, I just love data and am interested in the underlying support behind the session and website. I felt that discussion during this session was some of the most engaging that our cohort has had during a gear up. 

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

 There's only one word to describe this documentary: illuminating. There was an incredible amount info packed into this film on sexism in the tech industry. As previously stated, my former profession was fairly diverse. The M/F ratio in accounting stands at about 50/50 . It has been quite a shock to be introduced to this apparently rampant problem within the tech industry. Turing's education on the matter has been stellar thus far and the action behind their words of inclusiveness is on display daily at school. My biggest regret surrounding this gear up was the amount of time we had for discussion. The movie was incredibly engaging, yet we only had 10 or 15 minutes to discuss the compendium of knowledge that had just been dropped on us. I feel that many people felt this way, and that the next group to watch this would greatly benefit from an extended discussion session. This session represents the kind of social lessons that we need to be concscious software developers on the right side of change. I hope Turing continues to show this documentary and foster a rich medium for social growth and discussion.

#### (Universal Basic Income)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)
 
 I think that a Universal Basic Income is a novel concept, but is just that...a concept. I believe that we are still substantially far off as a civilization from being fully autonomous. I also believe that right now there are much more pressing issues than implementing UBI. I am a huge proponent for education, and I beleive that this country should fix it's education system and fully fund it through higher-ed. Providing people the tools with which to better themselves, regardless of their economic disposition, is the key to the near future. Uneducated, non-working, people cost our economy money while educated people pay enormous dividends on the economy in relation to their investment in education. I believe that if UBI was to be implemented, it would certainly have to be contingent upon some sort of civil service. In the same vein, things like illegal immigration would need to be addressed in some capacity as you can't deny millions of workers access to gov't help if you're giving it to the vast majority of the nation.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Flower Exercise)

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/flower_exercise.md)
*   [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16sqwlqqF9lTeVCIYCpvVl-0FUKuKr7cPwW4ut4eHfDM/edit)

#### (Feedback II)

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/feedback_ii.md)

 - I have mixed feelings about this session. On one hand, I didn't receive any negative feedback and wasn't really surprised by the feedback I did receive. On the other hand, some people were genuninely hurt by the traits that a previous partner had picked for them. I realize that being able to accept critical feedback is crucial to social and professional development, but seeing more than one member of the cohort disturbed/distraught wasn't pleasant. I guess I would say that I value 1 on 1 honest, in person, feedback to anonymous feedback. When presented with the other side of the story, one can make a more pointed effort to improve themselves. On the plus side, it was a positive affirmation that I'm not a "bad" team member. I work hard to do my best and provide support to the team and I think that's showed through. 

#### (Agile Practices & Project Management)

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/agile_practices_project_management.md)

 This session was really cool! Man, am I always down for an opportunity to improve my project management skills both as it relates to coding and also outside of the tech world. Being a techy for awhile, I had always seen people discuss "workflow" in the software development world...but really had no idea what it "really" was or how it was incorporated. Being introduced to the waterfall model, the agile manifesto, waffle, and some git workflow ideas was great. In the software dev field, the idea of workflow is incredibly important to producing good, consistent, sustainable work and I really took a lot of the knowledge dropped in this lesson to heart. 
 
#### (Strengths Finder)

- I initially thought that this session would end up like the "Feedback II" session, but I was quite wrong. This session was very valuable to me and helped me bridge a gap in confidence. I was given very kind compliments by my previous team mates while discussing our strengths. They brought up qualities that I strive to achieve and as such this session was affirming and profoundly humbling. The nature of my competetiveness (something I actively keep bottled up in entirety at Turing) was brought up, as those I dialogued with were unaware that I posses it as a strength. While I do believe that I could incorporate it more in my daily work, I feel like that is a dangerous path here at Turing. I'm not here to compete with anyone, save myself. I'm here to progress my knowledge as far I can and to give back to the community in whatever way I can...not to compare myself to others. However, as school progresses and things get more "spicy", I hope that my competetivness with myself will provide any extra motivation I might need in a moment of struggle. 

#### (Finding a Mentor)


 - My mentor is David Blankfield (a non-Turing mentor), a junior dev at progressive insurance in Colorado Springs. We talk 1-2 times a week, mostly chatting about topics of interest and the tech industry. I rarely have him look over my school work as he works in JS and I'm in Ruby/Rails. My goal is to reach out to two Turing mentors over the intermission week. 


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback
 -	Feedback to Charlotte Moore:
  -	Charlotte, I really enjoyed working with you on Bike Share. I feel like you greatly contributed to our cohesive, efficient team dynamic. Your insights were valuable and pairing with you was equally valuable as a learning experience for me. Honestly, I’m not sure what constructive feedback to give you. I feel like a cop-out answer to this might be “be more assertive” about some of your ideas, but thinking about that…it’s really not the case. When any of us had differences of opinion on a route to follow, we hashed it out logically and like adults. One thing that’s worth mentioning is that I think that some of your pre-planning and looking down the line at potential effects current actions in coding might have rubbed off on me. I’m very thankful for that, as it has been very useful in all of my coding since. It was a pleasure to work with you and learn from you on this project and I wish you nothing but good fortune on future endeavors!
 
 -	Feedback to Ashley Schauer:
  -	Ashley, working with you on JT was a pleasure. I feel that our team was a well-oiled machine and have you leading the way as our project manager played no small part in that. You are hard working, insightful, and self-aware as a project partner. I have a hard time coming up with constructive feedback for you. While you and Charlotte occasionally butted heads on which avenue to pursue in our project, we hashed out each others ideas like logical adults and always came to a group consensus quickly so we could move forward together. Furthermore, while others might say that your more intense nature can be intimidating (and I in no way mean this in a bad way), I found it refreshing to have someone as hard working and passionate about the task at hand as you on the team. Finally, I feel that I was able to learn a fair amount from you on best practices in coding. You have a knack for visualizing the ramifications that current code will have on future functionality and you are able to implement it before it’s needed (when you know it will be necessary). I think this foresight and though process is invaluable, and I’ve worked to implement it in all of my coding since. It was great to work with you and I wish you nothing but the best in your future endeavors!





### Being a Community Member

 - You've been a huge asset in our cohort. Your strong leadership abilities have shown through as our SAB rep. I think you have done really well at hearing our concerns and voicing them to the faculty. You've also been a great resource for bouncing ideas off of during projects and I look forward to working with you in the future. -James Anderson


### Playing a Part


Posse: 
-	The two main things that I did in my posse this Mod were working with an Arduino Microcontroller and circuit bending children’s toys. With the arduino, I progressed to incorporating a button to change multiple flashing lights. Circuit bending was enjoyable. We short-circuited audio paths within children’s toys to produce strange sounds and loops. I think it’s hard to really delve deep into this posse with so little time devoted to sessions. Even a two-hour session is hard to make substantial progress with. In the future. I hope to use my experience in Turing Lab to help me with a potential Mod3 personal project idea that I have. I think that TL has helped me grow professionally by bridging the gap between coding for an app vs coding for hardware which a topic I’m very interested in. 

SAB:
- This mod was my first as a member of the Student Advisory Board at Turing. I really enjoyed this experience, and I'm glad that I was afforded the opportunity to represent our cohort to the school. The main duties that we undertook this mod were providing support to students, passing on their feedback to the school and to facilities, representing their interests once a week at the SAB meeting, and working with other SAB members, Allison, and Ellen Mary to try and solve various issues surrounding our community at Turing. Within SAB, extra "responsibility" that I have taken on include researching and reaching out to potential stress management speakers and co-working-on the "Stay at school and watch movies" option for Final Friday. I can't wait to continue my role in SAB as a reprentative for our cohort next mod!

General:
- I feel that I've played my part in the Turing community by trying to be as helpful as I can to anyone that asks. I always keep myself open to questions on slack, in class, and during work time and rarely hesitate to offer my help if someone is struggling or asks for assistance. I feel that I have taken to rails very well this mod and it's truly my pleasure to help anyone that doesn't understand a concept or is having trouble implementing an idea (as I'd expect anyone else in my mod to help me, everyone is great!). It's also a great learning experience for me too, as I can practice teaching and reciting back knowledge that I've accumultated...further reinforcing it in my mind! Finally, I feel that I bring a positive, calm, and reassuring demeanor to the table. Inside and out of SAB duties, I try to always provide reinforcement to my cohort members and truly like and wish nothing but the best for each of them.

- Also, just as a side note, I haven't been late for or missed a single class in this mod. I value and respect both the instructors and my time.
