# Ashley Schauer - M2 Portfolio

# Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to focus more on utilizing my strengths as a team member and a professional. I also focused less this module on community engagement in order to better pursue goals and manage responsibilities outside of Turing. I focused on trying to learn as much as possible and continue to challenge myself.

Looking back on this mod, I think I struggled more with receiving feedback, but I did a better job of incorporating it and changing my habits than Mod 1, especially with TDD.

# B: Individual Work & Projects

## MixMaster

This project was very challenging for me. I remember working until iteration 3.1 or 4 and just hitting a wall. I think it was because I was having such a hard time with Capybara and TDD. I know with Bike Share I was far too specific with my tests and they didn't make intuitive sense. With this project, I tried to do better with user stories and intuitive feature tests, but I struggled a lot. Even though I didn't get very far with this project, I look back at this assignment and realize I could do it easily now, and with better, more intutitive feature tests.

## Mini-Project

The ultimate purpose of this app is like an e-commerce site, but instead of buying and selling items, users can catch pokemon for other users. The mini-project implements the ability for the admin to query the Pokemon API and create new rewards for users who caught pokemon to redeem with points.

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brandonrandall/pokemon_trading)

**API** -- There was already an existing Pokemon API, but it was the wrong version, so I "forked" it and rewrote it for the v2 API and used Faraday.

**Multi-create** -- The admin is able to query the API for a list of eligible items to add as rewards for the users. Using a single form, they can create multiple items.

**Favorites** -- Users are able to "favorite" rewards.

# C: Group Work & Projects

## Bike Share

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ryanspink1/bike-share)
*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

### Scores

1. Functional Expectations
 * 3: Application fulfills base expectations

2. ActiveRecord
 * 3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

3. User Experience and Conventions
 * 3.5: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.

4. Code Organization/Quality
 * 3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

5. Testing
 * 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

6. Working Collaboratively
 * 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

# D: Professional Skills

## Gear Up
### Tragedy of the Commons

*   [Lesson](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
*   [Note Reflections](https://gist.github.com/AELSchauer/8a39544819c4d2c596e55a1849d2a756)

I thought this lesson was really effective. It made me question my own desires of surrounding myself with like-minded people. Especially as a emotional defense mechanism during difficult times. However, I thought the philosophical implications of the lesson were too simplistic because people are not yellow or blue. They may identify themselves by something that isn't visible or by something other people think they shouldn't. I also felt that (like all these Gear Ups) there was not enough time for discusison and reflection after the fact. Perhaps if we were given a few questions to answer and then were asked to move to different groups and then share what our group had discussed? 

### Debugging the Gender Gap

*   [Lesson](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

So, there was a scene showing a group of black women hosting a workshop to teach black girls to code. I was surprised to find how uncomfortable it made me. I had this innate urge to be there, to be part of that group. I thought that I would be needed, but I knew that I wouldn't be "allowed" in. It drove me nuts not knowing why this didn't sit well with me. 

I thought about it more and I realized that some of that discomfort came from this stereotype that black people aren't really a part of the scientific or technological community, and that they needed help from whites or asians. Seeing that stereotype play out made me confront how ridiculous it was. 

I also realized that much of my discomfort came, as a white person, from seeing a situation where I was not welcome. Not that my skills weren't valued, but that the goal of this group was largely to give black girls black role models in science and technology. As a white person, I would undermine that goal. I would, subconsciously, reaffirm the stereotype that black people need white people or asians. I had long ago heard about "privilege" and the definition made sense, but I never recognized it in my own life. I realized that I've never felt excluded or unable to be included in something because of the color of my skin before. It never made intuitive sense for me. This scene finally made that click. My privilege is going this long in my life without ever feeling like an opportunity I wanted to participate in was not available for me because of the color of my skin. Once more, that my not being included was a *good* thing. 

### Universal Basic Income

*   [Lesson](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

This is a topic I've reflected on and debated with friends for a while now. I was not here for this gear up and I haven't had the chance to read these articles, though I'm very interested in it. My overall opinion is that UBI is seen as a means to solve income inequality in the age of automation, but the economics of it don't add up for me. I believe that UBI is a band-aid for a world that already has massive income inequality, and that the majority of jobs will be highly skilled jobs that can't be automated and service industry. That the bridge between those living on UBI vs. the education and skills required for  job will still be too wide to cross. I've had trouble imagining a world where 30%-50% of people are on UBI. People still need to do work and occupy their minds and bodies, so what would they do and where would they get the money to do it?

## Professional Development Workshops

### Reflections

#### Project Management Strategies

The Bike Share group went very well. We were productive and got along great. However, looking back on it, our workflow was not very strong as we were probably working too independently from each other. We split up testing from development, which is a big no-no, and weren't able to leverage off each other's work as much as we could or should have. The Little Shop group was more challenging in terms of interpersonal relationships, but looking back on it, had a better workflow and was a better product of shared work. However, it felt like some unspoken beliefs created tension within the group, and a lack of a strong decision-making paradigm or work assignment strategy created inequality. We were not as efficient with our planning time and therefore, I believe, lost out on opportunities to more effectively pair and collaborate.

#### Reflection on Feedback

I learned the type of situations where my passion and opinionated nature can cause issues. I learned how having a more independent work style means I have different things I want and need from a group and from my work on a project. I need to reflect more on how to balance that with the other needs of the group and how to "pick my battles". I am also starting to realize the drawbacks of being *too* self-reliant and autonomous, and that I need to learn to recognize strengths in others and opportunities in the moment and act upon them.

## Playing a Part

For the first few weeks of the mod, I was pairing with Mod 1 students at least 3x a week. I shared interesting links and resources I found online with people. I met new people in the posse groups.
