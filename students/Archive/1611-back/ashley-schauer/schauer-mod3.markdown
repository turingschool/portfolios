# Ashley Schauer - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to get my work done, and take some risks to push myself. Honestly, the most important piece for me was to not have a nervous breakdown. I wanted to take care of my mental health and spend more time with my family.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment


**1. Ruby Style**
* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

**2. Rails Syntax & API**
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

**3. Testing**
* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.

**4. Progression/Completion**
* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

**5. Workflow**
* 3: Developer commits almost every 15 minutes

I read [this story](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/) a while back about microaggressions. I found myself agreeing a lot with the points made, but after the discussion and talking to some people individually, it changed my mind. My biggest take away from our discussion is that while you could argue about whether or not any single instance is a microaggression, what's more important is whether or not there is a pattern of microagression. I'm still on the fence about whether or not the historical context of racism or sexism in giving "special treatment" is really helpful in working towards equality. All of this strikes me as the same debate a generation ago of quotas vs. reverse racism.

The Automation discussion was, unfortunately, really pessimistic. Although we were divided into two groups where one was supposed to come up with a list of cons and the other a list of pros, except both sides went the "cons" route. I think Trump's victory has really brought the realities of technology to the forefront. Personally, I think that technology has become a scapegoat for very real fears that people have about the future and globalism. Globalism, like technology, has touted itself as being great for democracy and equality, but we're starting to realize that these powers will not be equally great for all people. The TED Talk brought up a very important point, I think. That the power and opportunity created by technology are not going to be inherently egaltarian. That we need a variety of institutions (whether real or cultural or ethical) that will support that vision.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Alex, Jonathan, and I held a Friday spike on building a simple webscraper. One of the students approached me afterwards to discuss learning more and we set up an appointment for Thursday.
