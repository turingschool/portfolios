# Cody Borders - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

  Module two is important module for me because the material being covered is applicable to many of my past hobby projects and a few of my new project ideas.
  Since I began at Turing I've wanted to be able to build software that can create value for clients, and I thought mod two was the place where I could really start making it happen.
  There's so much more to learn and many ways to improve, but I've gotten to a point where I can quickly see real-world applications for the concepts we're learning, and that has me excited to build things.
  As with module one there were plenty of setbacks, and I'm not particularly impressed with my performance given the amount of time invested, but I'm motivated to keep improving. For the next inning I've
  identified some specific areas to improve, mainly getting better at asking for help from my classmates or instructors and either trying to schedule more time with my current mentor or finding another to increase the amount of time I'm spending
  with people who can assist me.

## B: Individual Work & Projects


Mix Master

https://github.com/codyborders/mix_master

http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mix_master/1_getting_started

Mix Master is a rails app which allows users to create playlists
of songs which also have an associated artist.

Takeaways:

  I thought Mix Master was beneficial because it both forced me to take a test-first approach
  which I've continued since this project began. I found that a well-written test can be something of a pair programmer who can help guide you
  through the development process. At the beginning of the module I wasn't sure about RSpec since we'd spent all of module 1 learning MiniTest,
  but I'm glad to be versed in both test suites and hope to become more agnostic towards which suite is being used on a project.

Rails Mini Project

https://github.com/codyborders/ideabox

http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project


Takeaways:

  Originally I chose to do two projects, one being IdeaBox and the other a simple app for uploading documents to a Google drive
folder accessible by authorized users. I attempted to build out IdeaBox without anyone else's assistance which ended up taking
a lot more time than anticipated. I spent a lot of time debugging and in Rails Console or byebug to see where mistakes were being made.
Though I didn't complete either project to my satisfaction I'm glad to have gotten into the habit of jumping into the console to explore --
I think this is something some students may overlook but I've found it largely beneficial.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects


* BikeShare

https://github.com/cmacaulay/bike_share

https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share

BikeShare is a Sinatra app which consumes publicly available data
from CSV files regarding bike share trends; it analyzes the data
to draw trends and display it for the user.

## Evaluation Rubric

Notes:

* Bug with create new station
* Page breaks when updating station
* Date inputs for temperature fields
* Links are submitting to get instead of post which breaks things



The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations


* __1: Application is not usable__

### 2. ActiveRecord


* __3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.__


### 3. User Experience and Conventions


* __3: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.__


### 4. Code Organization/Quality


* __3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/responses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.__


### 5. Testing


* __2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient__


### 6. Working Collaboration(optional)


* __3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.__


Feedback to me:

  From Amara:

  Cody, it was a pleasure to work with you and I think that you were a great addition to our team in terms of attitude and work ethic. I especially enjoyed the time when we paired together to figure out how to build the seed file, you were very easy-going and resourceful. I feel that you have very good ideas but you don’t share them often enough so we missed opportunities in problems that you might had the solutions for. I encourage you to raise more your voice and tell your team mates what you think suggesting some things to try. You really balanced our personalities and brought calmness to the team in some tense moments that inevitably happened so that’s highly appreciated. Believe in yourself and show more what you know that is much more that you are aware of.

  From Max:

  I really enjoyed working with you. You're tenacious, deliberate, and consistently positive. I felt like we had a good working dynamic and paired really well together. We were fortunate to pair together both building functionality successfully and when the material was very challenging. I felt that you demonstrated poise and competence across the board.

  Your personality is on the quiet and contemplative side, which is wonderful, but that comes with a responsibility to be sure that people know your opinion on issues. This isn't to say that you didn't communicate well on our project, because I felt like you made your voice heard and contributed a great deal, but only that on a meta level it's worth recognizing that quiet folks like you and me have to accept a certain responsibility for making ourselves heard.

  We should be proud of tackling this challenging project - we built a web app!

  From Casey:

  Cody, I really enjoyed working with you on Bike Share! We would not have gotten
  as far as we did if it had not been for all of your hard work on CRUD functionality.
  I think that you have a great team mentality, and appreciate that you were so
  willing to help others when they were running into bugs and errors. It was great
  getting to know you a bit more as well. I hope that you know how much your opinions,
  questions and perspective were extremely valued. Sometimes it felt like you might
  be holding back and in the future I would suggest you let your voice be heard! You
  absolutely know what you are doing. I appreciated your humor at the end when things
  got tough and hope to work with you again on a future project!

* Little Shop of Orders

  https://github.com/codyborders/abandoned_camel_coffee_mercantile

  https://camel-coffee.herokuapp.com/

  http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop

  The Abandoned Camel Coffee Mercantile is a Rails E-commerce site. It
  is backed by a Postgres database which holds tables for orders, users,
  items, categories, and item_categories. The app utilizes bcrypt for
  user authentication and also applies roles to users such that an admin
  role is present. The views were constructed with Bootstrap, and the app was
  tested with RSpec. It was deployed to Heroku(see above link).


## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up

* Tragedy of the Commons
  https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown

    Reflection:

      I thought this was an interesting session as it highlighted the biases many of us have even if we don't realize them.
      I didn't want to opine too much on the diversity quotas because I don't know enough about them to do so, but at first blush
      these quotas seem benign so long as companies maintain their hiring standards. I would have loved to see more data on the quotas
      with to quantify their effect.

* Debugging the Gender Gap
  https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown

    Reflection:

      The movie shown in this session was an eye-opener. The Harvey-Mudd story is really interesting to me as it shows
      how making fundamental changes to the way we teach can have a huge impact on outcomes. I liked how the film provided detail
      on how women hve contributed to tech, and how oftentimes women were the pioneers of programming. It was also a little disheartening
      to realize that the need for qualified people in tech is so high yet for many the opportunity to get involved is slim. It makes me wonderful
      what will happen in the future as other countries make these kinds of positions a priority while those in charge of education in the
      United States continue to push the archaic legacy education system on us.


* Universal Basic Income
  https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown

  As someone who has spent quite a bit of time researching both universal basic income and a universal job guarantee, this
  session was easy for me to engage in. One of the realities of the new economy is that those who have capital, high-value/hard to replicate skills,
  or a combination of the two will accrue the rewards in our economy. Many of those who perform unskilled work will be replaced by automation or lower cost labor.
  Those who adapt by learning the high value skills will thrive, those who don't will be left behind. Our legacy education system teaches students to be factory workers, not problem solvers. But today's economy relies highly skilled, cognitively demanding tasks to create value, not factories. As the number of skilled jobs increases and the low-skilled factory work is outsourced or automated those who helped the low-skilled jobs find themselves without work. A universal basic income provides these people with a safety net, allowing them to afford necessities. Automation is a reality, and it's just a matter of time before many once good-paying jobs disappear. UBI is a debated topic because some are concerned that the costs outweigh the benefits, and that a basic income reduces the incentive to work hard, or that it will increase the national "debt" (which is really just the sum of treasury security accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank and is utterly sustainable). It's important to think critically about UBI and not let unfounded assumptions determine your position. What have the outcomes been for countries where UBI exists? How are those countries similar to ours, and how might our outcomes be different (and why?)? We need to consider the net costs or net benefits of entitlement programs and not project our own views on how we think people should be living. It's also important to understand the realities of today's economy and the affects of tech-savvy capitalism on our society. To be a responsible citizen you should have read economics literature post-university, read through the Z.1 on the US Treasury site and familiarize yourself with how monetary policies and entitlement programs actually work, how they're funded, and how much they really cost.

### Professional Development Workshops

  * Collaborative Communication
    https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/collaborative_communication.md

      Deliverable:
        Reflection on project management strategies you used in your team
        projects; What went well? What didn’t go well?

        I'm a big fan of using Waffle in conjunction with GitHub to create an easy-to-follow workflow. Bike Share was the first time
        I'd used Waffle and at first I didn't really see the benefit, but after using it in a group setting I think it's awesome. I think kanban board style workflow
        makes it easier to break a project into smaller pieces and keep everyone on the team abreast of the status of any story at any time. I've also found that consistent
        use of branches on GitHub is beneficial because again, projects get broken down into smaller pieces and it's easier for other members of the team to see what's being
        worked on, what's up next, and what's been completed. In both group projects we did our fair share of building multiple pieces of functionality on one branch rather than splitting
          them up, but I think that's something we'll improve on with practice. I also liked our attempts at integrating agile practices like daily standups into our workflow. On Bike Share we
          were dilligent about doing a standup every day explaining what we did, what we planned to do the next day, what went right, and what went wrong. Not only was this process cathartic, it
          helped us get in the right frame of mind for the next day because we knew what our goals were and since we stood up and told everyone in the group there was a little more of a feeling of
          responsibility to get on task right at the start of the day. In Litte Shop we all worked together in the same area so we didn't implement standups in the same manner. In hindsight we should
          have been doing the standups regardless for the reasons mentioned above.
          I was fortunate to be assigned as project manager for our Bikeshare


  * Feedback II & StrengthsFinder
    https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/feedback_ii.md


    Deliverable:
      Reflection on how you incorporated feedback from your team
      members and what you learned about yourself in the process:


      Most feedback I've received has come with an implication that I don't speak my mind.
      I understand why I receive this feedback, but the reality is I just don't have that much to say. I do my best to share when I do have a thought, and I think I've improved a lot when collaborating
      on a task, but I still give the impression that I'm witholding what I'm thinking.

  * Completed Flower Exercise


  * Mentor Plan

    I have a mentor with whom I worked throughout module 1. This module we met 3 out of 5 weeks due to some schedule conflicts. Moving forward I plan to find a second mentor to add a little more depth to my learning.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

  For Amara:

  Amara, it was great working with you on the Bike Share project. I enjoyed exchanging ideas with you while we paired, and I think we both gained a lot from it. Your outgoing personality and upbeat attitude really helped keep the group motivated and focused on our goals in spite of the challenges we faced. I'm impressed with your ability to balance being both a mother and a Turing student -- it's quite an accomplishment to be able to handle both at the same time. When working on future projects I encourage you to keep your eye the big picture and not let yourself stress over individual things you aren't quite satisfied with. During our Bike Share project I noticed you were really intent on completing the project -- which is understandable and a good attitude to have -- but in focusing on finishing we may miss opportunities to maximize our learning. That didn't happen on Bike Share, but it's something to keep in mind in the future.


  For Max:


I got a lot of value from working on Bike Share with you, particularly pairing with you and working through those first ActiveRecord queries. I like how you take a methodical approach and try to break things down into smaller pieces, and how you'll take time to yourself to focus deeply when you're trying to grasp a concept. I thought you handled your PostGres issue really well even though it was a multi-hour headache, and that you didn't let it get in the way of getting something accomplished on the project. And you read the docs! During the project I observed that you'd work for extended periods of time on a single problem, which I like to do as well. I think sometimes this can be counterproductive, and that it's a good idea to take a break at least every 90 minutes to let your mind relax for a bit.



### Being a Community Member

### Playing a Part

I washed dishes on weekends! Which is more "giving back" than I did in module 1.
