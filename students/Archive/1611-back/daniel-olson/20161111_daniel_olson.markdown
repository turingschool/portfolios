Daniel Olson - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to understand the fundamentals and logic of programming.
My goals were to finish the mod with a better understanding of what programming
really is and how to apply that knowledge to real world situations.

## A: End of Module Assessment ROUND 1

Notes:
* Initial implementation of stock check indicated some confusion. We want to return a `value` from `@stock` and not the entire hash `@stock`
* Able to identify tests that drive incremental development of desired functionality. Ex: testing `cookbook` before testing `add_to_cookbook`
* Some solid testing fundamentals: writing assertions, familiarity with return values versus methods that change state.
* Concerns about testing fundamentals. Originally wrote `cookbook_can_hold_a_recipe` test without an assertion.

## Rubric

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API
* 2: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental concepts

#### 2. Completion and Progress

Describe how your dynamic as a team could be improved
-I feel like we collaborated well for our first pairing project. The only improvement that I can think of off the top of my head is combining 2 ideas into one. For example, one day we both had an idea for a method and we couldn’t execute them individually but then after more research found out that we needed to incorporate both our ideas simultaneously to make it work.

Describe your role in creating and sustaining that dynamic
-I feel we both contributed to this project in large ways. We talked about expectations (DTR) right off the bat and followed through with it. We were both here busting our asses to make this work and I feel we could both feel our dedication to this project.

Describe your partner’s role in creating and sustaining that dynamic
-same as last answer. There were no surprises and he kept his word and busted ass to get this done.

What changes/actions on your part and theirs would improve the dynamic?
-So being more open to mixing ideas as opposed to just trying one persons “way”. Maybe taking a step back instead of pushing so hard to try and go one way.

#Group Feedback
*To James Anderson*
First of all I want to commend you for being an awesome partner. I feel that both
of us having families and dealing with the struggles of managing those things
while going to school was a topic we could always talk and share on. This open
communication flowed into our project and allowed us to make a plan of action
for what we wanted to accomplish. We were able to break the project down into
pieces so that we could focus on one thing and collectively push forward on that.
We did struggle at points but we kept our composure and followed our errors so
that we could troubleshoot them effectively. I was especially impressed with
your progression with identifying syntax errors that might have derailed us for
X amount of time. Other things that we struggled with were the sharing of
responsibility and driving time on the keyboard. I feel that part of this issue
was with my asserting control and wanting to push forward. I should have done
better at checking in with you for understanding. On the other hand, I would
have liked to see you stop me more and point out specific things you don’t
understand or why I might have done something a certain way as opposed another
way. This would give me clarification on what I need to give you so that we can
both move forward together and we have a mutual understanding of the work we
did. Also, I think we both could do a better job reading the markdown and making
sure we are executing the program properly from the start. On the other hand,
you have a much better understanding of classes and how to access elements in
those classes. You might not feel like you contributed a lot but the reality is
that you saved us a lot of time when caught errors or when you figured out the
missing link to our “crack” issue. You know a lot more than you think you do and
I saw progression in your understanding from start to finish. By the end you
were able to take the project and write tests on your own and have a pretty good
idea were things are coming from. Thank you again for crushing Enigma with me
and I look forward to collaborating with you in the future.

*To Daniel Olson*
Thank you for your hard work. You are very proactive and easy to get along with.
I would also venture to say you are one of the strongest students in the class.
This puts you in a unique position for a Mod 1 student to be both teacher and
student. Additionally, it means that you will most likely have equal or stronger
ability than most of your partners this mod so I would encourage you to slow
down, relinquish the keyboard, and focus more on navigating and sharing your
knowledge while still listening to your partners' suggestions. Working on
Screenhero with you was also a cool new experience for me but I would remind you
that your partner can only see what's on your screen so being more vocal as you
whiteboard would be helpful. That being said, white-boarding with you is kick-ass
because you are very good at breaking problems down into manageable chunks and
descriptive diagrams. You're light-hearted nature made what could've been a
daunting project into a fun learning experience.

In Headcount we are parsing huge amounts of state data into repositories and
comparing these data sets to each other.

Assessed By: Beth Sebian

Repo: https://github.com/rtravitz/headcount

Notes:
* Got through 4 and added 6
* Testing overall strong, would like to see more unit testing with stubbing or mocking
* SRP generally upheld; only shortcoming is methods juggling a lot of responsibility
* Style overall strong, some weird things with returning true/false when simple condition would suffice
* Some great use of enumerables (group_by) but opportunities to replace each in certain scenarios with better choices
* O sanitation errors

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset
* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown

This was a great session which dove into the concept of "not yet" Having a child of my own
this topic really hit home for me. I think the idea of "failure is not final" is a priceless
resolve that we can all follow.


#### Gender Gap

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown

This was an interesting gear-up. I felt that the material presented in the movie was generally good.
I did however feel that it was very biased towards men and it made me a little uncomfortable.
I am a very open and accepting to all people. When I saw the story about the women who was threatened with
physical violence I was really upset. That is really not good and I would definitely stand up for someone
in that situation.

### Public Narative

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_public_narrative.markdown
This was my favorite gear-up so far. Beth did a fabulous job of running this. It was so awesome to hear
all my cohort-mates' origin stories and correlate our similarities. I felt personally closer to the
people in my group for going through this together.

#### There is an I in team

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown

This was my favorite retro. I huge team player and enjoyed reflecting about what others
were thinking. Repeating our teams thoughts really put weight on listening skills and gave
us a better understanding on how to correctly give feedback. This was a good team building
experience that I will continue to use throughout my career.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown

I really like the information presented in Kathy's keynote. It gave great insight on
how we learn. There were good tips for how to manage your time and focus on one thing.
Also breaking the topic into smaller pieces until you understood the whole topic. I try
to do this in coding on things that I don't really understand and it has really helped me
increment my learning.

### Professional Development Workshops

*Resume* https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B53sMa0Nsm1lQmZUU2UzQ0t0cEU/view?usp=sharing

I wasn't able to attend most of these due to pairings or evals. My take away form
what I did see was the importance of branding yourself as a software developer.
The advice for managing your Twitter and Linkedin accounts was very valuable. Specifically
the on about how to setup your resume on Linkedin.

#### Personal Branding

* https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p1.md
* https://www.linkedin.com/in/denverrei
* https://twitter.com/DOlson_Dev

This workshop had some great tips for helping you stand out in the marketplace
and make yourself more attractive to tech companies. I setup a new twitter profile
specifically for software development. Chose good colors and plan to use regularly
to get my presence up. Linkedin will progressively improve as I add more programming
references and gain more experience in the field.

#### Learning To pair
https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/learning-to-pair.md
We were introduced to the DTR which is used when pairing with someone. This is
a great tool that I have continued to use when I'm doing a pairing project. It
sets boundaries and expectations for everyone in the group. It also helps with
scheduling group work time and individual divide and conquer tasks. I will continue
to use this powerful tool throughout my career.

#### Personal Branding Part 2
https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p2.md
I couldn't attend this workshop due to a pairing. My takeaways after reading the
markdown are this. Designing an attractive and appealing website is key to getting
the attention on you. Not only that but it's a great place to show your creativity.

#### Strengths Finder
Strengths Report: https://github.com/blackknight75/portfolios/blob/master/students/1608-back/daniel-olson/Daniel%20Olson%20GallupReport.pdf
Affirmations: https://github.com/blackknight75/portfolios/blob/master/students/1608-back/daniel-olson/Affirming%20My%20Strengths.pdf
I really liked filling out this strengths assessment. It Opened my eyes about how I'm thinking about myself
and how I can use my strengths to assert what I know to squash my doubts. It was empowering to see these results
and renewed my resolve for following through with this new career path.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

### To Students:###

*Brett Rivers::*
Brett was an awesome addition to the team. He is very knowledgeable in many areas
and is eager to share what he has learned. This outgoing personality allowed us to
collaborate and assert our learning with each other all throughout the mod. He has
a great sense of humor that definitely helped during those tough times. Brett is a
welcomed addition to any team!

*Jason Conrad::*
Jason is an awesome addition to any team. His willingness to help and reach out to
those in need is always welcomed. His lighthearted sense of humor and encouraging
spirit helped me through some tough times in the module. We worked feverishly on
event reporter together and his resolve never waned.

*Megan Talbot::*
Megan and I were partners for SAB. She was so creative and proactive in all aspects
of our responsibilities. She was always open to new ideas and gave constructive criticism
were needed. She will be awesome as a continuing representative in mod 2.

*Robbie Smith::*
I really enjoyed Dan's presence during the module. His openness is very welcoming
and he is always attentive when he is speaking with you. He was also eager to be
of help and serve others. He's a good dude to have around.

*Ryan Travitz::*
I was very fortunate to be able to work with Ryan Travitz on Headcount. It was an
absolute pleasure to work with him throughout this project. Ryan’s work ethic and
teaching ability is second to none. He would constantly check in with me for
understanding and was always willing to explain something that I wasn’t totally
clear on. Also, he would regularly check in with me to see if I had input on a
specific problem or error we were facing. The only negative that I ever experienced,
and not really a negative, is that he did like to drive when we were on to something
important. However, he never let me feel like I was left in the dust. Like I said before,
he would always check in with me before moving on to the next iteration or method
we were building. Ryan is extremely talented and is able to see the code much deeper
than most people and has a strong fundamental understanding of how objects work
together and interconnect. His insight and vision are astonishing and I see him
going very far in this career. It’s been my absolute pleasure working with him
and he has taught me so much. I’m not sure that I could have had a better partner
for this massive project with such a cool head and great personality.

*Courtney Meyerhofer*
Courtney has been an absolute pleasure to work with. She constanly brings things
I struggle with down to a logical level that I can understand. She is able to
communicate very clearly when collaborating and is very creative when it comes
to difficult problems. I look forward to work with her in the future and know
that she will go very far with the set of skills she has.

*Chris Dale*
Chris has been an inspiriation to me. Since day one I have seen himself push
himeself to the limit to understand the material. Even though he struggled I
saw vast improvements in readability of code and understanding of class
relationships. I also see him reaching out and trying to be a part of every
learning opportunity that he can get his hands on. You can't teach this kind of
desire to learn. Hi grit drives me to be better. The night is darkest at dawn,
and thats where Chris thrives. Thank you Chris!

*Ediline Cruz*
Ediline is a fabulous person to work with. She always brings a smile and a
positive attitude to class that is so contagious you just can't help but being
effected by her. Her perseverance and determination to work past difficult
problems while keeping this attitude is her strongest strength. I remember
messaging her at 5:00am, still being up, struggling with my project and she
still tried to cheer me up even though she was dealing with a similarily
difficult problem. Thanks "G" for being so awesome!

### To Turing: ###
I think the order of the classes could be adjusted. I felt that some of the classmates
would have been better served at the beginning. Also, more hash drills and hash manipulation
classes would be helpful. This is a major part of the last 2 projects. I learned a lot
just diving in but some more guidance or drills to help accustom to the use of them.

I think as a community we could do better with the safe space and listening to others
opinions even if they are against the grain. We wont always agree but we can respect each other.

### Being a Community Member

Mark Miranda::
Dan is always a pleasure to pair with. He has this hunger to understand everything
that's going on and is very aware of the topics that he may be behind or lacking
on and always wants to improve on them. He has an infectiously positive attitude
that will help him go far while at Turing and in post-Turing life. Dan's continuous
desire to challenge himself is amazing to watch, especially in seeing his growth
in breadth of knowledge over the last 6 weeks. He's a great person and I'm excited
to see the things he can accomplish over the next few modules.

Dan is relentless. He works hard to understand every bit of code he writes. I'm
glad to be a mentor to someone that has the drive to understand every piece of
code that he writes. He's great to work with and is willing to do what it takes
to be better. He's grown so much as a developer since his last stint in module 1
and I'm still excited to see what he can accomplish over the next few modules.

Ryan Travitz::
I had the opportunity to work with Dan on Headcount, affectionately described on
its Github template repo as "a whopper of a project." Throughout what was sometimes
a trying experience, Dan was a very supportive partner. I appreciated his work ethic
and flexibility. But more than anything else, I was impressed by Dan’s communication.
We re-DTR’d several times—not for anything negative, but rather just to make sure
that we remained on the same page. Without his commitment to communicating clearly
and effectively, I’m sure our partnership would not have gone as smoothly.

Megan Talbot::
Dan was my partner as an SAB rep this module, and I couldn't have asked for a better
teammate. He was always around to bounce ideas off of, and he was supportive of any
idea of mine. I will miss him next module! But I know he will be a huge asset to his
new classmates, just as he was to us.

Ediline Cruz::
Many times you dedicated your time to teach others and help them succeed even when it meant you didn't have enough time to complete you own project, I couldn't be luckier to have you in my cohort. Great code is not only your present to us but also how be to an amazing human being. I'm really looking forward to work with you in the future.

Jason Conrad::
Dan was a great addition to the community. He advocated for our module in the SAB
and was always interested to hear how we felt about things and how we were doing.
He was also always available to help with things that we may not understand and
there was many a time where we were here late at night working out similar issues
together. He definitely made the community and overall experience far more pleasant.

Brett Rivers::
Dan is a great community leader as half of 1608-BEs SAB, he is easily approachable
to discuss issues regarding the module and it is apparent he cares about the module.
He is also an excellent community member and cares about discussing individual's
personal issues.

Courtney Meyerhofer::
Dan, I really enjoyed working with you as a partner in SAB as well as on some
code. I feel inspired by how much you care for others in our cohort and how you
go out of your way to address others' needs. I think you do a phenomenal job of
balancing / surviving Turing while taking care of your family. During times of
struggle, I appreciate that I could turn to your for emotional and technical
support. Thank you for going significantly out of your way and above the call
of duty of SAB to be an excellent peer. I look forward to working with you in
the future.

### Playing a Part

Actively reached out to students who were struggling and taught back what I had
learned to solidify my knowledge and help push understanding for other students.

Organized special activities, with Courtney Meyerhofer, for our cohort to improve
cohesiveness.

Was a member of SAB and did my best to convey the best interests of my cohort.

Actively volunteered to help setup rooms when there were special events.

Reached out to students who needed help to reassert my learning and continue the
helping and giving nature of the community here.
