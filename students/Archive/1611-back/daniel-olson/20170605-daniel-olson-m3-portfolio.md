## A: End of Module Assessment

## B: Capstone Project (MentorShip)
  We were tasked with adding additional features to the Turing MentorShip app. This app pairs students and mentors together. We used the Turing Census app to authenticate and pull user data into MentorShip.

   This was a very challenging project to work on but I think it encapsulated what being a developer truly is. Dealing with issues, miscomunication and most importantly, how to rely on your team and each persons individual strengths.

This was a pretty amazing experience. I really hope that Turing keeps doing gear ups like this. It was nice to be able to pick the topics we wanted to work on and then present them to people who actually wanted to be there and have a conversation about it. This model really felt positive and from the feedback I received it was well received amongst the student body. The biggest challenge was trying to stay neutral and making sure that we cave everyone a chance to voice their opinion.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

We lead the Turing lab posse for 2 mods. This was a great experience for all of us. Being able to take a hardware idea and then bring it to the group and actually make it was amazing. It definitly gave us a break from the Turing grind ad allowed us to express ourselves in new ways. We had originally planned to finish the Truing Arcade box by the end of the mod, but lack of support and mosltly time we were not able to finish. It was disappointing but feel like the experience of doing was awesome and we will finish it in the near future.
