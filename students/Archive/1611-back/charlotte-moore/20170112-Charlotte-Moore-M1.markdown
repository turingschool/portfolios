# Charlotte Moore - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My primary goal in this first module was to engage myself fully in the community and commit myself to learning the material. I feel as if I met these goals over the course of the last six weeks. I joined and attended the Pahlka Posse, and utilized the community pairing resources. I set out with the intention of developing the ability to use ruby effectively and I am happy with the level of proficiency I have at this point. I had some programming experience prior to starting this module, and had a strong conceptual foundation. That said I struggled tremendously at the beginning to produce functionality from that conceptual understanding. By working through the projects and the materials provided, such as drills, I think I have developed a strong foundation on which to build my skills.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

With every project I could see my ability to use ruby grow. I really enjoyed the challenge of working on the projects, and believe they are what really drove the development of my understanding. I struggled tremendously with being able to translate my conceptual understanding into functional application. However, as each project presented a new set of challenges, the exposure to new expectations advanced my ability to recognize how to execute new functionality. When we were given the Binary Search Tree I had no idea how to even start, however by the time we kicked-off Headcount I had was able to not only come up with a strategy, but also implement it.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I only did one group project this Module, but I really enjoyed working with my partner. We struggled a lot with Complete Me, but ultimately I think we got a lot farther than I would have gotten on my own. It was a huge challenge to coordinate writing code, not only because of my introverted nature, but also because of time. I found that it took a lot more time to get through parts of the project, simply because we both had to have an established understanding before we moved forward. Overall, I would say I learned as much about ruby as I did about communication working on this project.

### Complete Me

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

## D: Professional Skills
The Gear Ups and professional development sessions were really useful in terms of providing resources. The professional development sessions helped me understand how to think of and market myself in professional terms. The Gear Up sessions were focused on opening up a new perspective on motivation and communication.

### Gear Up
#### [Gear Up Reflections](https://gist.github.com/CjMoore/62d796e5e6eb6d26e558a7fb0bce0b2b)

#### [Growth Mindset](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)
#### How do you think past experiences or experiences this week that have encouraged growth or fixed mindsets?
When I started working on the project I was a bit overwhelmed. I wasn't sure how to approach it, but I knew that if I put the time and effort it would come to me. I was stimulated and driven by the challenge which is an example of my growth mindset. I've never encountered the idea of Growth Mindset in an official way. This scession helped put into terms something I already understood with regards to determinism. The idea that if you think you're going to fail, it's likely to become a self fullfilling prophesy seems like common sense, however in practice it can be very hard to curb dissapointment when faced with failure. 
#### What are your triggers, what's likely to move you to fixed mindset?
I think the idea most likely to move me into a fixed mindset is that I cannot affect the world around me. 
#### What can you peers do to support you staying in the growth mindset?
My peers can help support me by not being jerks. I feel like the growth mindset is something that is cultivated internally, it's difficult for me to figure out how others could help me in doing this other than not activly discouraging me.

#### [Cohort Norms](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_cohort_norms.markdown)
#### What actions do you want to take for yourself and your cohort to be successful at Turing?
I know from experienc that introverts can often be seen as disengaged or self-concious and it was nice to have an opportunity in this Gear Up to communicate how that interpretation is often wrong. I think using the things that I learned in this gear up to adjust my perspective of how others see and react to the world will help me have empathy for others who have very different personalities from me. I think engaging myself fully in all aspects of the Turing program will help myself to be successful at Turing. I think having empathy and treating others in my cohort with respect is a way in which I can help others be successful at turing as well. 
#### How can you leverage your place on the spectrum of introversion/extroversion to impact your career in the future?
As an introvert I naturally avoid conflict and confrontation, which I think is a good quality when looking for a job which requires a lot of teamwork. I think a lot before I act or speak which I think gives me an advantage in dealing with confrontational or difficult people. This is something I need to think more about.

#### [Personal Stories and Connection](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_personal_story.markdown)
#### What brought you here?
When asked the question "How did you get here?", the thought "every decision I've ever made" is pervasive. It's difficult for me to pinpoint something concrete on which to build a narrative. I guess I could say I came to turing because I was unsatisfied with the my previous job. I felt like I had more potential, and wanted to do something that would open up more opportunities for myself. I found out about Turing from a friend and figured the risk was worth the possible reward. 
#### What are the values that drive you?
This is another really hard question. I want to take care of myself and the people I care about. I want to do something that benefits the world around me. 
#### How do you think you demonstrate those values to people around you?
I work really hard to be informed of the world around me. I think awareness is essential to identify problems which I want to focus my energy on. I also work really hard to be good to the people I care about. I want to be able to support my partner, and be in a position to look after my sister if she ever finds herself in trouble. I think I'm demonstrating my commitment to them by being at Turing and making an effort to put myself in a more secure position financially. 
#### Could other people identify your values from your actions/words/presence? Why or why not?
I have no idea how others see me. I'm naturally reserved, which I believe is a defense mechanism. I think I make it known to the people who are close to me that they are important and my efforts to better myself are motivated by my desire to be there for them. 

#### [Grit]( https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_personal_story.markdown)
#### Is it possible to interpret that experience through the lens of grit, i.e. your grit to get through a difficult situation was under strain?
I have had fleeting feelings that my choice to come to Turing was a mistake, but I haven't yet felt like I wanted to give up. I will not allow myself to consider giving up, I feel like I made a commitment to this program and I won't allow myself to back away from that. I think the most challenging thing I've faced at Turing so far has been failure to complete some projects. This has been particularly challenging because I fell as if I couldn't have put more time or effort into completing them, yet they were still unfinished. This hasn't made me feel like I want to give up, but I've had to perservere through the dissapointment I felt because of these challenges. 
#### Is that lens helpful?
I think it's necessary to acknowledge and experience the negative emotions associated with failure, however having grit helps to reinforce that setbacks are often temporary. I like to think that grit is a quality I possess because I am passionate about programming, and I am utltimately willing to perservere through the stress of this program because it will help me to reach my goals. 
#### Is it in any way problematic (emphasizing pushing through when you really need a break)?
I think my willingness to push through the challenges in this program have come at somewhat of a cost. When I'm faced with a problem I often get tunnel vision. I forget to eat, don't sleep enough, and just generally fail to take care of myself. I think I need to learn how to balance focus on a problem with taking care of myself. I think having a hardline 'I need to get through this' attitude can also put a lot of pressure on myself, however it also helps me perservere through the stress that pressure causes.

### Professional Development Workshops

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/index.md)

### Personal Branding I
#### Who are you?
I am a software developer who has a passion for finding efficent and effective solutions to complex puzzles. A deep enthusiasm for critical thinking and problem solving inspire me to seek new opportunities and challenges. 

#### How did you get here?
I was working in an industry in which there was very little room for growth. I felt as if my prospects were stagnant, and I was very unsatisfied. I learned of Turing through a friend and felt it could offer me an opportunity for personal and professional growth. 

#### What's next?
No idea. It'd be nice to get a job.

#### Takeaway
This scession gave me a good idea of how to begin thinking of myself professionally. The terms, such as 'Personal Branding' and 'copy' really help establish that a job hunt is an exerciese in marketing. The idea of marketing myself makes me incredibly uncomfortable, but I can understand how and why it is essential in finding employment. 

## Learning to Pair
- DTR for CompleteMe - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YYJI1AAFYqhP__s6LiIH8rKphEaoMDGRc6MAWsBKLGA/edit?ts=5849e9a9#heading=h.l3ct5pv2ggfg

#### Takeaway
Learning to pair was extremely helpful with regards to establishing a format for pairing. It gave me good terms in which to think about cooperation and a good foundation for how to communicate.

## Feedback I

**(From: Me To: Beth)**
Your positive attitude helped me stay focused when I became really frustrated with this project. When I wanted to give up you were a great source of encouragement, and you really pushed me to keep going when it seemed like we weren't getting anywhere. I don't think our dynamic helped advance our project because we fed off of eachother's confusion and ended up going in circles a lot. I felt like we were on the same page for a lot of stuff, but we were on the wrong page and both of us had trouble seeing that. I think it was difficult for both of us to step back from the problem, which contributed to the mire we found ourselves in. You were great at seeking out help and improved your testing a lot over the course of this project. Despite the frustrations, it was great working with you.

**(From: Beth)**
I think you had great passion about the project and wanting to succeed. You showed up on time, put in extra effort. There was never a moment where I doubted if you were in for the long haul. And thanks for letting me take over a lot of the testing. That was important for me to learn and I really appreciated it.
I think we might have had that tunnel vision with our project. There was a point where we were both spiraling and feeling defeated. We should have met at Turing instead of the coffee shop so we could have grabbed some help. But that’s a hindsight thing. You’re github skills are getting there! We probably should have outlined how we were going to merge, pull, create branches and all that. We need to whiteboard, psuedo code, and test before we write any real code. I think we got into trouble when we started hacking away at it.

#### Takeaway
Writing feedback was hard for me. It requires a good balance of positive reflections and critical assessment. I understand that in order for feedback to be effective you have to be critical of the things that did not go well, however there is always a concern of being hurtful. I think it's something I'll get better at with practice.

**(From: Me To: Mark)**
When I was feeling really defeated about Battleship you sat with me and Max and helped us put our dissapointment in perspective. It was so incredibly helpful for me to hear that, from an outsider's perspective, it seemed like I was doing well. The encouragement was invaluable, and helped me adjust my attitude. I felt so much better after that conversation. I know that you struggled a lot this mod and I think that your attitude will help you through the rest of your time here. Thanks for the support.

t has been such a pleasure getting to know Charlotte, I'm so glad she's in our cohort! It was hard at first to feel connected to other people in Mod 1, but Charlotte and I quickly bonded over board games, and I've always felt like I've had an ally in the cohort ever since. I'm so looking forward to continue getting to know her over the net few months!

### Playing a Part

As a module one student I think I helped the larger Turing community by focusing on my goals and learning. I think by using resources, such as pairing, I helped other students contribute to the larger community. I hope in the next modules I will have the opportunity to give back more.
