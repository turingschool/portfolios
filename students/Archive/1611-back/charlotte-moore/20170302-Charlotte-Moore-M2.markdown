# Charlotte Moore - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This Mod I worked really hard to step out of my comfort zone and become more engaged with the members of my cohort and the community. During the last Mod I struggled to assert myself and ask questions in class, and I received feedback that suggested I improve in this area. I asked a lot of questions this time around, and believe my learning benefited greatly from this engagement. I also reached out to members of other cohorts, and was able to pair with some of the Mod 1 students. I also worked on a project with two front-end Mod 4 students as well as Katy and Casey, and I'm really happy with the application we created. I enjoyed learning how to use Rails; and building applications that I could interact with in my browser. Over all this mod has been really fun and engaging.

## B: Non Evaluated Projects

### Rails Mini-Project

* [Mini-Project Repo](https://github.com/CjMoore/path_minder)

* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

This was the first project where we were able to come up with our own idea and be creative with Rails. I chose to build an app that was based on a need I encountered while playing the tabletop roleplaying game Pathfinder. In this app, I used one-to-many and many-to-many relationships to provide the user with a quick reference for combat scenarios. The app is intended to be a tool for the Game Master, and allow them to keep track of character and creature stats in individual combat scenarios. The most valuable thing I took away from this project was from working through the process of creating an app from an idea. When I started this project I was over-ambitious and as I worked through it I had to figure out where I could cut back. I learned a lot about my own limitations, as well as my strengths. 


### Mix-Master

* [Mix-Master Repo](https://github.com/CjMoore/mix_master)

* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mix_master/1_getting_started)

In this project we built an app that used one-to-one and many-to-many relationships between tracks albums and artists. The structure of this project was that of a tutorial. It walked us through how to build a Rails app using TDD. The most valuable thing I took away from this project was learning how to follow errors to produce functionality. At first the order in which the tests pushed functionality was uncomfortable. I wanted to do things in an order that made more sense to me. This would mean building the migrations and models first. Forcing myself to follow errors was really valuable, as I learned that they can help me create functionality that I didn't immediately know how to produce. I've continued to build on this idea, which has been incredibly helpful.

### One Nation Many Voices

* [ONMV-Backend Repo](https://github.com/One-Nation-Many-Voices/ONMV-backend)

This Mod I had the opportunity to work with two Mod 4 front-end students, Christine Gamble and Chelsea Skovgaard, as well as Casey and Katy, on a project called One Nation Many Voices. The app is intended to be a tool for organizing civic engagement and protests. The end goal is to make an app that takes information about protests and civil actions from facebook, meetup, and twitter and put that information in one place. Ideally the user would be able to search for events in their area by category and save the event to a calendar. When we began this project we knew that we didn't have the knowledge or experience to produce all the desired functionality, so we broke it down into a manageable goal. We used a live google doc that lists Town Hall meetings and office hours with Senators and Congressmen and were able to seed it into a database of events. We were then able to create end-points for Christine and Chelsea to hit and do their front-end magic. I learned an incredible amount from doing this project. When we began I had absolutely no concept of how front-end and back-end interacted with eachother, and wouldn't have been able to tell you what an API was. I feel much more comfortable going into Mod 3 with the knowledge and experience gained from this project. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Bike Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ryanspink1/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

We built a web app with Sinatra that tracked bike share stations, trips, and weather conditions.

### Evaluation Rubric

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

#### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* 3.5: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.

#### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* 3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

#### 5. Testing

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

#### 6. Working Collaboratively

* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

## D: Professional Development

### Project Management

Prior to this lesson I had heard of Agile development, but I really had no idea what it meant. After having implemented it in Bike-Share and Little Shop I can absolutely see the advantage it brings to web development, particularly in comparison to the Waterfall process. This lesson was invaluable to me as PM on our Little Shop project. Our team communcated really well throughout the project despite circumstances that could have been really difficult to overcome. The team was able to meet at least once a day (for the most part) to go over what work had been done and what work needed to be done. This helped tremendously when communicating with the 'client' at our check-ins as the team was always on the same page. 

### Feedback

The most valuable feedback that I've gotten at Turing is that I need to open up and communicate more. I'm naturally introverted, but I realize that's not an excuse. In Little Shop I took this feedback and stepped into the role of PM. It was extremely uncomfortable at first but with the support and advice of my team members it really worked out. I'm incredibly happy with how that project turned out, and I'm happy that I was able to step into a role that forced me to be communicative and be successful. 

### Flower Exercise

 * [Flower Link](https://gist.github.com/CjMoore/7afb60be09063bea67a308ee0a670a99)

### Mentor 

I've reached out to two people about mentorship. The first never responded, and the second agreed to be my mentor, but I haven't heard from him since. I intend to take time over intermission week to reach out to a few more people. I'm looking for a mentor who I can talk to about civic tech and Python, and there are a number of people on the mentor spreadsheet who have experience with these things. After the PD session today I realized my approach could be the issue,  so I intend to seek feedback from peers about the way I'm reaching out.  

## E: Community

### Tragedy of the Commons

 * If tech executives seek teams in which at least one third of team members are like them than that means at a minimum at least one third of jobs in these companies won't be available to people unlike them. This is an issue because it limits the opportunities for people of different genders, ages, and races. 

 * I think diversity quotas are a good way of counteracting systemic bias. It helps ensure that negative bias is less of an issue in the hiring process. 

 * I think education is the best way to counteract negative bias. I think engaging people who are unlike yourself is the best way to offset any learned or intrinsic bias we may have. The "other" is only the "other" because they are unknown. 

 * I think doing gear ups like this are a good way of educating people about the dangers of embracing a group norm that is exclusionary. 

 * PotP's goals were to provide an interactive model that demonstrates the effects of collective bias. I think it was ultimately effective, it was fun and engaging. 

### Debugging the Gender Gap

 * My experience at Turing has not reflected many of the experiences shared in the documentary. I do not feel belittled or patronized by my peers here, in fact I feel respected. I am worried however about transitioning into a job, simply because I have experienced gender based discrimiation in the past. I feel that my experience at Turing has been positive, as the community here is very supportive. 

 * I work to check my own judgements of people, and try to have an open mind with regards to others. I'm not a particularly outgoing person, I do my best to be approachable and kind in my intentions. 
 
 * I over heard someone making racial comments and didn't say anything. Later that day a member of my cohort expressed that they felt discriminated against. I think I could have said something at the time to support the person who was hurt by those comments. 

### Universal Basic Income

 * As technology progresses and jobs become automated, there will be fewer jobs. One of the first questions people often ask eachother is 'what do you do?', and as a result I think a lot of people base their value to society on their occupation. I think this focus will have to change in order for us to move forward. I think however people may have more of an opportunity to explore their interests and passions, which could greatly benefit society. 
 
 * I think Elon Musk's opinions on the future of our country, in particular with regards to UBI, are based on his perspective as an innovator. I think his perspective on the rapid growth of technology is somewhat skewed by the fact that his life's work is devoted to the advancement of technology. 
 
 * Universal Basic Income is a program in which every adult person gets a set amount of money from the government every month regardless of emplyment status. People should know about automation and the effect it has on our workforce because we need to be prepared for a future in which there are fewer and fewer jobs. 
 
 * It is worthwhile to be educated about automation because knowledge is power. 

## F: Feedback

** (From: Andy) **

Charlotte Moore:
    It's been a terrific time getting to know you during Mod 2. Thank you
  for being so responsive to questions, and generally amazingly thorough in
  answering them. You helped clarify more than one thing that I didn't
  understand this inning, and I really appreciate that. I'm glad you
  started opening up and talking more. That's a difficult barrier for anyone to
  overcome, but you're breaking through it awesomely! Given that it seems we're
  going to be heading into the realm of networking and job-hunting next Mod, I
  think it would be helpful for you to keep up progress in that area. It's an
  absolute pleasure having you in our cohort, and I'm really looking forward to
  seeing what Mod 3 has in store. It's gonna be a good time.
  
  ** (From: Courtney) **
  
  Charlotte, I really enjoyed working with you on the Little Shop project. I observed your technical strengths to include: testing, debugging styling issues, the MVC framework, and a particular acumen for strategic planning. As a project manager, you considered everyone's opinion and input as equal and frequently engaged in forward/big picture thinking that kept us on a successful track at a manageable pace. As a peer, you consistently stopped what you were doing to help others work through difficult problems and took on many of the unexpected tasks that came up throughout the project. In the future, you may find it useful to advocate for the tasks you specifically want to ensure you're getting the learning experience you desire out of a project. You were very communicative on Slack and GitHub, and your thorough code reviews helped us verify / challenge our assumptions about what our code was doing / not doing. I particularly appreciate the attention to detail you exercised in going through all of the user stories and code at different milestones throughout the project. I enjoyed all of my interactions with you, and I'm proud of the application we built together.
  
  ** (From: Casey) **
  
  Charlotte - I really, really enjoyed working with you and thought you did an
amazing job as the project manager, which I know didn't feel natural to you at
first. I thought you did a great job driving the project forward, in terms of
code, staying on top of waffle cards, and making sure we were all on the same
page by doing stand-ups etc. I really appreciate your flexibility in enabling
me to both go to the Lesbians who Tech summit and execute code. The only feedback I have to give you is to have more confidence in your leadership 
abilities, you were really a force in making sure our project met the specifications
laid out by our user cards. You're very clearly immensely strong in rails and
what we have learned this mod, so it might be helpful for others if you paired 
with them. It was so great working with you and I'm so proud of the application 
we built together, and recognize fully that it could not have been done without you!
  
   ** (From: Ryan) **
   
   Charlotte, I really enjoyed working with you on Bike Share. I feel like you greatly contributed to our cohesive, efficient team dynamic. Your insights were valuable and pairing with you was equally valuable as a learning experience for me. Honestly, I’m not sure what constructive feedback to give you. I feel like a cop-out answer to this might be “be more assertive” about some of your ideas, but thinking about that…it’s really not the case. When any of us had differences of opinion on a route to follow, we hashed it out logically and like adults. One thing that’s worth mentioning is that I think that some of your pre-planning and looking down the line at potential effects current actions in coding might have rubbed off on me. I’m very thankful for that, as it has been very useful in all of my coding since. It was a pleasure to work with you and learn from you on this project and I wish you nothing but good fortune on future endeavors!
   
   ** (From: Valerie) **
   
   Charolette, you're a great project manager, and a great team member; I really enjoyed having you as a teammate. Our project kicks ass I don't care how we score on it, and I can thank you and Courtney for that. You both were the back bone of the team, and I'm  unsure with out the both of you we would have done so well. This project felt the easiest to work through partly because it wasn't so difficult and partly because we all got along so well. Some food for thought: If ever in a project manager again and more so if you know the material decently; strive not exactly to get top scores on the project but to evenly divide the project responsibilities, and allow people room to struggle. Just for an example, I don't think I worked on a piece of the project by myself and instead of paired a lot with you. Albeit the testing part I asked for but then I never had a moment to struggle with a problem on my own. The only other piece of advice would be to be conscious of your driver/navigator habits; while we paired together everything went pretty smooth when I was driving and you were navigating; but when we switched you took on both navigator and driver. You're a great pairing partner to work with however; you kept a great attitude the whole time. I enjoyed that you took the time to celebrate the wins; it reminded me to lighten up and I really valued that. I hope I get the chance to work with you again.
   
   ** (From: Chelsea and Christine) **
   
   Casey, Katy, and Charlotte- Our backend team! We’ve been so impressed with your willingness and enthusiasm to jump into the One Nation Many Voices project. You each provided valuable perspectives to the planning phase, and the API you created was really helpful in building out the MVP. We know you are going to be successful developers with your work ethic and problem solving abilities, and we hope you’ll continue working on this project!
   
#### Contributions to the Community

This mod I was able to contribute to the Turing community at large by paring with <od 1 students and engaging in a project outside of the curriculum. Pairing with Mod 1 students was really fun, and helped me engage more with people outside my cohort. I worked really hard to lead students that I was pairing with to the answer as opposed to solving problems for them. This helped me with my own communication skills, and hopefully helped them through the problems they were struggling with. Working on ONMV with Chelsea and Christine was also really fun and informative. I have hope that the app we built together will help more than just the people in the Turing community, but also people who want resources for civic engagement.
