# Jonathan Serrano - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I set out to understand the subjects presented in this module, how they work, why they work, how to implement them in scenerios where context is not provided. As time went by I realized that my goal was quite broad due to not previously knowing what I was going to be presented with during this course. Eventually what became important to me was test implementation, how to write tests effectively and let them guide me in writing my code. The other one was to be able to follow the data wether it's between classes, methods or one variable to another. These two were my biggest goals regarding Ruby itself.
My community goals were to help my classmates with their own questions, to join a posse and get a mentor. An offsight goal was to develop a healthy routine that would help me balance this new lifestyle challenge.

## Professional Development

#### Feedback from Edilene for Enigma pairing
  *  I’m happy that we worked together in this project. We were great at listening to each other and being clear at the expectations we had. We started out really strong by creating a plan and setting daily goals that unfortunately, were not met at times but that kept us grounded and in our toes and that wasn’t bad actually. Several times you gave your suggestion, looked for help and asked questions that would guide us in the right direction. I was extremely pleased with your acceptance of using Waffle, GitHub and I was extremely amazed on how you kept your cool when GitHub was being a pain. Your calm demeanor will continue to be an amazing asset when working in groups and your willingness to try something new will help you succeed in the future. I would be great to work together again.

#### Feedback from Katy for Headcount paring
  *  Jonathan, working with you was awesome. Your natural calm helped us stay focused on this monstrous project. You were incredibly supportive, and we wouldn't have been successful without your cool head. Thank you for being such a great partner.

## Community

### Gear Ups
#### GrowthMindest
* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)
* The whole idea of having a growth mindest is important to succeed in an environment like Turing. I definitely feel that having the correct mindest, being positive even in the face of failure is important; looking at the successful steps taken and not the steps missed. I feel that most of my life I've had a set mindest, I would skip hard challenges, challenges that are thought provoking and move to the next one. What I learned from this session is that I need to commit myself to these challenges and accept the results of them. Even if it means failure, I cannot be afraid of that. Therefore having a growth mindest is a must in this environment if I am to succeed.

###Grit
* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
* Grit is a marathon and not a sprint, an action that must be followed through to be successful. Grit is the action of having a growth mindset. The mindest part being the reflection on the action of grit, of what went right during that marathon to complete the given objective. The mindest to pull out postives from any failures that may have occurred during the Grit phase, during the phase of perserverance. 

###Strenghts Finder
* The stregth that I personally identified the most within my top 5 is Intellection. I truly enjoy delving into readings, conversations and material that enriches my mind on subjects that interest me. I enjoy learning about that subject for example learning how to code using Ruby, its classes, methods, how arguments are used etc all interesting to me. The drawback comes from going down the rabbit hole, there are times were curiosity of what I am learning strays me from the path that requires an action to be completed in that instance instead of doing more reading/learning. 

###Introversion
* This session was useful in understanding how other introverts like myself approach situations that we are typically presented with in social/work settings. How each of us tends to follow the same model of being quiet and think first before acting/talking. Also it was helpful to see how extroverts see us and how the two personality types can come together in creating a dynamic work pair.

#### Giving Feedback

Project Partner Feedback(Enigma)
* Edilene BackEnd 1611
* I want to take this moment to thank you for an amazing paired project experience. I will be honest and admit that I was skeptical how this pairing would go due to never participated in one. Your ability to manipulate data and be able to follow it as it moves from class to class is by far amazing. Listening to your explanations of your implementations of methods and objects really helped in making Enigma an enjoyable project. I know that you preach TDD and we followed it the first couple days but we veered from it as the project got bigger. Causing us to “hack” the code and write tests after code. Staying focused on TDD will help you with your time management by saving you unnecessary reformatting time. Your test writing abilities are an area of strength and I would enjoy seeing you thoroughly master this skill as you seem to be a natural at it. Thanks again for being a helpful, informative, well-rounded partner and good luck on your next pairing.


Ken Lee BackEnd 1611
* Ken, your dedication to this program is surpassed by none. We all come here to learn how to program but you strive to understand the material to the point where you feel comfortable enough to work with it in a variety of ways. Your approach of having a solid foundation before moving on has made me change my method of learning for the better. Being a great communicator is one of your perks, for example explaining to me why I was not being able to pull from Github and talking me through the steps of how to resolve the conflict is only one of the many instances where your skills have had a positive impact on me. I have faith in your ability in becoming a well rounded programmer. Thanks for being an awesome peer, friend and community memember.

#### Receiving Feedback

* Jonathan, you have been awesome at being a fellow cohort(er) and I am inspired by you perception and action to make Turing a more inclusive space by starting the Turing minority group. I am honored and excited to see how we can make a difference to our community (not just Turing but our local tech community). I feel with we can make a positive difference! I've seen you studying hard early in the morning and into the late hours in the Blakement and I am inspired by your dedication and know you will be an influence to incoming cohorts with your example. I have no doubt you will become an amazing developer and continue your work to better people of colors lives through learning to code.

#### Community Involvment

 * Currently I am working on establishing a support base called "Turing Diversity" that focuses on three subjects, current students, incoming students and community outreach. The goals are to create a foundation support group for all of those who identify as a minority, where we can help out each other in succeeding during our time at Turing and after. Incoming students would benefit from having an established support group where we can become mentors, guide them through the process, help them if they are out of town and or are having a hard time assimilating into the culture. Community outreach delves into reaching our community base, the future of tomorrow, the present, to show that there are people like them in tech. That there are other ways of succeeding in life than some of the options that draw so many people of our community into. Goals are to adopt a school where we teach code, create a blogpost, put out a diversity panel etc. I've also participated in the weekly health challenges, attended code-for-skills, productivity lunches and other programs that I hope that I was able to leave a positive footprint as they did on me.
