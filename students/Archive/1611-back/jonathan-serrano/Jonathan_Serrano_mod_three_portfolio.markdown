# Jonathan Serrano - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Individual Assessment
#### Evaluation Scores
##### 1. Ruby Style
* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components
##### 2. Rails Syntax & API
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
##### 3. Testing
* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.
##### 4. Progression/Completion
* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.
##### 5. Workflow
* 4: Developer commits every 15 minutes

### Projects
I worked on the following projects:
* Rales Engine
* Cloney Island
* Higher Education In Colorado

#### Rales Engine

* [Github URL] (https://github.com/JonathanSR/rails_engine)

* Rales Engine is a sales engine that uses Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes its data schema. This was my first real introduction to working extensively with creating an API successfully. The API creation was not as challenging as using ActiveRecord and Postgresql logic in finding all the queries. The introduction of using activerecord serializers made the export of the API straight forward and not as daunting as I had assumed. Also using SQL joins, where's, include and other SQL queries was a big takeaway as a skill that I need to work on plus these queries are interesting.

#### Evaluation Scores
##### Completion
* 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 3 (5 for individual project) or fewer spec harness tests.
##### Test-Driven Development
* 3: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>80%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
##### Code Quality
* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
##### API Design
* 3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.
##### Queries
* 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

### Cloney Island

* [Github URL](https://github.com/cmacaulay/folio-share)

* Folio Share is  a Dropbox clone that mimics its functionality of file uploading, downloading and sharing. It gives the user the ability to share its folders and files with other members, those members are then able to access those folders and upload/download content from them as they see fit. Folio Share also implements the functionality of making folders/files public to the rest of the community. The scope of this project is something that caught me off-guard. Working on a project of this magnitude really made it important to have communication as a priority with the rest of the team. It also brought the term "agile" to life. Features were implemented, taken out and re-implemented all the time. At times it did get a bit frustrating trying to keep track of all the moving parts but in the end my team and I had a good enough workflow that features were integrated with minor hicups.

#### Evaluation Scores
##### Client Expectations
* Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client. - 2: Below expectations
##### User Experience
* Project exhibits a production-ready user experience. - 3: As expected
##### Organization
* Team used a project management tool to keep their project organized. - 3: As expected
##### Git Workflow
* Team always used pull requests and commented on pull requests prior to introducing code into the master branch. - 3: As expected
##### Test Quality
* Project is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written? - 3: As expected
##### Code Quality
* Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.- 3: As expected

### Service For Dreamers

* [Github URL](https://github.com/JonathanSR/schools_in_colorado)
* [Heroku URL](https://service-for-dreamers.herokuapp.com/)

* Stats for College is an app written in Ruby that uses that Rails framework. It introduces the consumption of an API, data analysis of that API query and exports the analysis to the app. Along with becoming more comfortable working with an API, background workers and caching are introduced into the project, two helpers, that I had not worked with before. I want to eventually introduce AJAX calls, I didn't get time to research a good place to implement them for this project. The purpose of this application is to give High School students a tool that helps them make their Higher Education Institution choice easier by providing statistics on different Colorado Institutions. Statistics such as how many students graduated from that Institution for a program, how many ethnicity students graduated from that program compared to the rest of the program participants etc. The app is not done, It's at level 1. Level 2 is an introduction of available scholarships based on the user's search. Level 3 is providing admission office and other relevant offices information pertaining to the search performed. Level 4 is using Google Maps to pin the queried school onto a map. Level 5 is providing the cost of the program queried for the  year queried based on a 16cr, two semester, resident, attendance. Eventually I want to have this app be of actual use as one of my personal goals is to give back to the community, especially the underreperesented community and I want to gear this application towards them.

#### Evaluation Scores
* TBD

## Comunity
### GearUps
Gear Ups for This  Mod:
* Microagressions
* Grit
* Automation

#### Microagressions
* I've experienced microagressions in my time here at Turing. Did the party involved know about it? Probably not, the thing about microagressions is that a lot of times you don't know if what you did or what you said is a microagression until you've been made aware of it. It is sessions like this one that bring to the forefront a set of microagressions to watch out for. For us to recognize what is a microagression, what can be a microagression and how to educate the parties involved about them. Now if that same microagression by the same party keeps happening then thats another thing completely, I've been fortunate not to have that happen, yet. 

#### Grit
* Touching back on this topic after being introduced to it back in mod1, my thinking of what Grit is, has stayed consistent. Grit to me, is still the desire to push through when the going gets tough, pushing through but being smart about it. During my time at Turing I've had several moments when I am working on a project, the time is late, implementation of a feature is close but the mind isint there anymore. This is where being smart comes in, knowing that it's best to rest and write good code as to be tired the next day and have to rewrite your code that was written at those late hours. Also learning or studying, personally, there comes a point when I am reviewing documentation on a gem, service, etc but it doesn't make sense. As much as I would love to use it by the end of the night its not going to happen thats when, for me, it's time to turn off the lights.


#### Automation
* Automation has been a factor of humanity since the stone age, when wheels, led to carts that led to buggies, that led to cars etc. My thinking is that humanity has always adapted to the latest technological change, this time around, the rate that automation is happening, is faster than we can adapt to. Eventually everything will be automated, that cannot be argued, what can be argued is what our status as humans will be. What our social construct will revolve around. If there is no work, is there money? Will there even be currency, If everyone has the same benefits as the next person what will we use to gauge our status? Automation will have an effect that we cannot fully grasp or speculate.

### Feedback

### Spike Session
* Myself along with Alex and Ashley led a spike on webscraping and it was an intense experience.  I am one to not talk infront of groups, never liked it, enjoyed it, never performed well. It's not like I was unprepared, its just uncomfortable being up there but that's a big reason I choose to lead a spike, to work to being comfortable with being uncomfortable. Leading the spike gave me an opportunity to being uncomfortable and not being able to back away from it. I did a live code session, my tyiping could have been better, my explanations could have been better, my tone and level of voice also needs work. The spike also allowed me to present something to the student body that I thought was pretty cool and was glad to find out that other students enjoyed and learned from the lessson presented. Seeing as mod4 there are two "community" requirements I may host another one, what better way to get better at something you dislike than practicing it over and over again. 

### Module 3 Takeaway
* Overall I have an agenda of things that I need to work on, starting with JS & AJAX calls. Those two are going to be instrumental for future success, I did not find a place of where I could use them in my personal project without rewritting big chunks of it therefore a lot of my intermission time is going to be spent familiarizing myself with them. Background workers, caching, speeding up the application, decorators, presenters etc. these and more are a lot of things on the ruby side that I want to get better with and will be actively exploring them on my own. The module was tough, i struggled with API consumption for the longest time but I feel like I have a good grasp on it now, SQL is something else that I need to improve on, and another thing that's on my agenda. I have to decompress after this module to correctly gauge how it went, right now I'll give it a 7/10.
