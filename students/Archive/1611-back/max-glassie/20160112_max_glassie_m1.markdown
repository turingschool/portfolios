# Max Glassie - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I came to Turing in order to jump into a community who has the resources to help me take my programming knowledge to a professional level. I fell in love with programming from an intellectual perspective, I've never been more satisfied or had more fun, and I wanted to join a community of people that feels the same way.

I've spent a lot of time deepening my understanding of humanity and now I want to be able to build solutions to our problems. After pushing my individual study as far as I felt I was able, my plan was just to do whatever you all asked me to do. I didn't have specific goals beyond gaining proficiency in Ruby and to embrace the opportunity to deepen my theoretical knowledge.

I'm much more motivated by intellectual growth than I am on "becoming a developer." In that sense, I'm driving towards those outcomes more than the tangible skill set or label. I see the value of programming as a way to develop organizational capacity and to deepen my ability to use abstraction to solve problems and engage the world. Ultimately, for me programming is about building interactive models that allow us to express better the human spirit and to promote human dignity.

I have a learning characteristic that I can't execute until I have a full grasp of the concepts. This can lead to challenges in meeting specific functionality goals, which is clearly an area of growth for me and is clear also when viewing my performance in this module. I've learned a lot but I haven't always completed the requirements.

### Date-Night

* GitHub URL:https://github.com/maxglassie/binary_tree
* Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown

The project requirement is to build a binary search tree to store and interact with data. I really enjoyed this project because it was an opportunity to dive deeply into how to use recursion in object-oriented programming. I learned how to imagine myself inside an object when writing procedures and to see program design in terms of passing messages between objects. This was a significant point of growth for me.

### Battleship

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/maxglassie/battleship.git
* Original Assignment: http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship

The goal of this project is to build a Battleship game that can be played from the command line. I really enjoyed the project because it required us to think about how to design and build an application, from the interface with the user all the way down to the database structure. It tested my ability and encouraged me to think about how to design programs. While a small scale program, the suite of problems that we faced in this project about application design scale to building larger applications: how to build a database, how to interact with that database, and how to build functionality that serves an end user.

While ultimately I didn't complete the project's functional requirements by the deadline, from an intellectual perspective I really enjoyed wrestling with these problems. From speaking with my classmates, I realized there were many viable approaches for meeting the same set of requirements. I was impressed by how crucial decisions about data structure and interface determined the overall program design; those first fundamental decisions represent tradeoffs that continue to reverberate. An extremely valuable lesson moving forward in my work as a developer.

#### Complete Me

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/AELSchauer/turing-complete_me.git
* Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown

For this project we were required to build an autocomplete feature using a data structure called a trie. The final deliverable needed to be able to load millions of data points from the dictionary included in our Mac OS.

For me, it was the perfect extension intellectually from what I learned in building a binary search tree the previous week. My partner, Ashley Schauer and I had an excellent dynamic and worked very well together; I learned a lot working with her. It was especially fun to use recursive procedures to build robust functionality with clean code.

**Feedback from Pair Partner: Ashley Schauer**

"Max, thank you for being a fantastic partner. You and I were incredibly excited to work together, and I felt like we were a really strong team. We were always on the same page with our goals, ideas, and expectations. Your open, honest style of communication will make you a very valuable team member on all your future projects.

I really appreciated your growth mindset, and your confidence when presented with a challenge. You weren't afraid to ask questions to better understand a concept or problem. You often would ask for me to finish my explanation before asking additional questions, which was incredibly helpful for me since I can often get distracted from the topic at hand.

I'm also really impressed how much you've already cultivated a methodical approach to problem-solving. One of the challenges I first had with code was jumping around too much when I ran into a bug. You picked up how to look at code the way the computer does really quickly. For example, when we had written some code, and you were a bit confused about what it was doing, you broke it down line by line, talking with me about how you thought it worked. I appreciated that you would proofread my code for small details that I would miss (like missing my second '=' with conditionals).

From my own experience with coding, half the job is learning. Learning how to find answers to questions and problems or learning how to improve your code. I have been incredibly impressed that you worked through that book on LISP and read through Nate's code on the Binary Search Tree to learn to write code more elegantly and efficiently.

When we sat down for our DTR, you said one of your goals was to learn how to code better. I mentioned a few times during our retro conversation about building on your "coding intuition". I would recommend learning more about different data structures (e.g. hashes vs. arrays) and which scenarios are best to use them. Another part is knowing how individual methods work and how to accomplish a task.

Also, learning by reading is a great method, but it'll only take you so far. As will drills. The best way to get better at writing code is to write code. Hackish code is finding the first solution that works. Writing good code involves trying to find a better solution for a problem you've already solved. You have to experiment. There are a ton of websites that give users a variety of coding challenges by size and difficulty, and many users have posted their own solutions for you to compare to your code."


#### Headcount

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/maxglassie/headcount.git
* Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown

Headcount is a wonderful project where the objective is to build a relational database with query and analysis functionality for a large set of Colorado educational data. I was excited about this project because I am fascinated by storing, manipulating, and analyzing data.

My long term goals include developing a strong skill set in all aspects of working with data; from research generating data to building systems that manage and interact with data.

I'm grateful for the opportunity to build this functionality from scratch in Ruby. While I've done data analysis in Excel and SQL, it was a great experience to be faced with the challenges of managing a large set of data files from a purely programming perspective. I particularly enjoyed the organizational challenge and intellectual abstraction of building data access, relationships, and analysis layers in an object oriented style.

The lessons I learned here are a great foundation for working with databases in web applications. This is powerful knowledge. Furthermore, this project really introduced me to the frustrations and wonders of hashes. They are so powerful and efficient. I'm happy to have developed a greater ability to think in terms of those patterns.

The last iteration is very valuable because it teaches us how to query multiple databases at once and return the synthesized information using objects. I found the meta-pattern for data processing of accumulate-map-filter-enumerate useful in writing this set of procedures.

**Feedback from Pair Partner: Brandon Randall**

"Hey Max. It was a pleasure working with you on Headcount. I feel like the way you ended up delegated things in this project enabled us to learn as much as we could. I appreciate the patience you showed when plans changed from our original DTR. I also want to acknowledge the leadership you showed and the initiative you took to keep moving forward in the project when I was not available. Lastly, I want to say that it was fun working with you!"

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

**Growth Mindset:**
* [Session URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

While this idea can become a bit of a cliche sometimes, I really believe in the underlying principle. For me, my major shift in perspective on personal and intellectual growth took place while living in China and studying Chinese. The primary determinant for learning that incredibly challenging and difficult language is not intelligence but simply persistence and a willingness to be constantly humbled. This experience, perhaps the most challenging of my life, gave me the confidence that I could learn to program and ultimately, via a long and winding path, led me to Turing.

My trigger or sign for recognizing that I have a fixed mindset is the phrase "I know this" or a binary statement about being, such as "I am bad at math" or even more dangerously "I am a master of this." For me, the growth mindset requires a consistent willingness to be grateful for humbling experiences and a personal compassion for both my failures and mistakes and those of others.

**Introvert/Extrovert**
* [Session URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_cohort_norms.markdown)

This session was valuable because it helped me understand better how to notice the patterns and work with people who have differing personalities. Having a framework and a method for discussing these variations at the outset of a working relationship is very valuable to my professional growth.This framework also helps me notice these patterns in myself and my friends; recognizing that my personality and preferences are a key to unlocking my potential rather than a limiter is a simple but powerful idea.

**Public Narrative:**
* [Session URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_public_narrative.markdown)

I'm fascinated by narrative and have spent significant time studying how story binds and shapes communities. Any opportunity to engage in this kind of work is welcome to me. I enjoyed the community organizing worksheet on developing your story, especially because the group discussions gave us an opportunity to get to know our classmates better and share our motivations for joining the Turing community. I was glad to hear that my classmates share similar aspirations, patterns in our stories, and motivations for being here. It was a great exercise and I would like to do more of this in the future.

**Grit**
* [Session URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

I found the articles and the video quite helpful. Holly Duckworth talking about how grit is both being persistent in the face of challenge and being passionately engaged in the subject matter. Her research that shows believing that challenge leads to growth and that each individual has an innate ability to learn regardless of their level of intelligence is very empowering. I want to embody this kind of positive mindset because how we perceive ourselves and the world is a key factor for the opportunities we find - "you can't find what you're not looking for."

### Professional Development Workshops

**Personal Branding Part I**

* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/personal_branding_p1)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-glassie)

This is a great opportunity to learn how to represent myself better to potential employers and professional collaborators. I'm grateful for the opportunity to improve my personal narrative and brand strategy in a way that will allow me to connect more with people who will ultimately help me grow professionally and do work that makes a positive impact on society.

**Learning to Pair**
* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/learning_to_pair)
* [Link to DTR for CompleteMe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o5-fhjnbDLyxf6a9XyhjIjcVn09Rrs81u7ye0d0KQIc/edit?usp=sharing)

Ashley and I started our project with a comprehensive DTR that really helped us as we progressed. Some aspects of that discussion were not captured in our written DTR but were valuable - especially where we outlined how our personalities inform our collaboration styles.

Especially the DTR is a fantastic tool to encourage agreement and addressing key questions at the beginning of a project. It is perhaps most valuable for being a check to help us stay on course and be productive when things get difficult.

**Feedback I**
* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/feedback_1)

I am always grateful for the opportunity to learn more tools and frameworks for giving and receiving feedback. Communication is essential to achieving success and doing great work. I appreciated the framework they presented on triggers that may prevent me from listening and gaining value from feedback given to me.

I'm going to keep the three types of feedback in mind as I move forward. Understanding when and why to use the different types - appreciation, coaching, and evaluation - is very valuable.

**Personal Branding Part II**
* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/personal_branding_p2)

This workshop helped me think more about how to convey my message. I am looking for a work environment that values my background and appreciates how I can help our team beyond just being a programmer. I'm working on integrating my story from prior to Turing into my current story; showing how there is continuity in my reasoning and what ultimately brought me here. I fell in love with programming and I see it as a way to help serve others.  

Specifically, we're writing copy to put on our personal websites. We reviewed examples and then were given key question frameworks to help us design our story.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

**Courtney Meyerhofer**

"Courtney, I've really enjoyed getting to know you during this time at Turing. I'm especially impressed with your service on the Student Advisory Board. You've been a leader in helping bring our cohort together as a community and also as a representative to the instructors and staff, shouldering those additional responsibilities with patience and grace.

I'm glad to find someone who also gets excited about the intellectual joy of programming and I look forward to further learning and exploration together. You're an excellent problem solver, have great instincts, and I've learned that I can rely on you as a sounding board for ideas and to provide a clear mind when I get stuck. I hope we get a chance to pair on a project in the future."

**Ashley Schauer**

"Ashley - I really enjoyed working with you on CompleteMe. I admire your intellectual capability and technical skill. I felt that we had a great working relationship and that we did well to achieve the project goals.

Specifically, what I learned most from you was your ability to clearly draw and whiteboard concepts, to use tools and frameworks to communicate about and logically solve problems.

As we've discussed, one of your significant challenges is how to manage the fact that you're so strong in this subject matter. I admired your ability and intention to work together when you had a more clear vision of how to move forward.

I think the time that we did run into a significant issue with the parsing of the weighted hashes, I saw your true problem solving self; who you are when you're challenged come to the fore. In those moments I felt like you have a tendency to go a bit more into a cave to grind and hack the problem out. This makes sense. But I will say there may be an opportunity for you to notice when that happens and to find new tools and tricks to bring your partner into that space in a helpful way. That ability to stop and reflect on where you are in the process is a place where you could find a lot of growth.

But on the whole I really enjoyed our dynamic. I think you are good and getting better at communicating and that it's important for you to seek out new challenges and discomfort.

I said at our first meeting that I'd like this to be the start of a long term intellectual partnership. I still would like that, and for friendship too.

-Max"

**Brandon Randall**

"Brandon - I feel like you grew a lot in this past week. You’re a good man who is working hard to improve yourself while juggling significant family responsibilities. This was a tough week for you. When those many responsibilities presented challenges to our partnership in terms of availability over the weekend and I brought those concerns to you, you took ownership, responded to feedback, and stepped up.

I admire your grit, your dedication to learning, and your willingness to push yourself to make a significant contribution to our final deliverable. You responded beautifully when I challenged you to grow intellectually and as a programmer; that growth mindset in the midst of struggle will take you far. Good job."


### Being a Community Member

##### Feedback To Me

**Courtney Meyerhofer**

"Max, I'm really glad I got to occasionally pair with and get to know you this module. I think your technical strengths are in creating beautifully architected systems, and I think you will be an excellent developer. Your enthusiasm for elegant solutions is absolutely contagious. I also really appreciate that throughout the module I could turn to your for emotional and academic support. You always lent an ear and provided feedback on ideas I shared with you. The few times we paired together were some of the best pairing sessions I've had, and I sincerely hope we are paired together on a project in the future. To improve as a developer, I think you should keep the phrase 'red, green, refactor' in mind. It's okay to have underdeveloped code that passes tests and to then clean it or restructure once you have something working. You are conceptually very strong, and I'm excited to see what you build in the future."

**James Anderson**

"Since sitting next to you on day 1, you've been a great confidant and valuable member of our cohort. After strengths finder I realized you and I have similar approaches on things and the questions you often pose in class are ones that I usually also have. You have approached sticky situations in a professional and dignified manner and your hunger for knowledge is always apparent. You provide much needed comic relief but are clearly a hardworker. I look forward to pairing with you in the future."

### Playing a Part
I attended the Hack the Dot hackathon; we built a "Re-Gifter Registry." I did my best to be supportive of my classmates throughout the program, especially to be supportive when people were struggling not just with the material but with emotional challenges of such an extraordinary amount of growth and adaptation in such a short period of time. Intense immersive environments create intense ranges of emotion in the journey to learning.

But there is clearly room for growth here - next module, I'm hoping to gather people to watch some fascinating lectures on computer science and engage more with the civic tech and entrepreneurship posses.

**Retrospectives:**
Looking at the retrospectives from across the module, I feel like we did a great job of using this time to help us come together as a cohort. Having the time to express and share our feelings and reactions to a educational experience that is both incredibly intense and also provides significant opportunity for growth was very valuable. We were able to deal with difficult issues and find better ways to support each other during this experience.
