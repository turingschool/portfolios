# Max Glassie - Module 2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
This module was a period of exceptional growth for me. I've struggled from the start and I am proud of how I was able to transform an experience of burnout and a significant set of personal challenges into one of the most valuable six weeks of my life.

Recognizing the signs of this struggle early, I moved to adopt better organizational habits and institute a disciplined routine to maintain a consistent effort for working through the academic material. Additionally, I began taking care of myself properly and began to work with a life coach; this has been incredibly rewarding and transformative.

Academically, my learning style of moving deliberately through material and thinking deeply resulted in a combination of significant learning and a consistent struggle to finish projects. In module 1, I wrote and developed all my programs with little help and with pure logic; I had enough theoretical depth to make this possible.

Learning Rails requires a different strategic approach in that much of the learning is following predetermined patterns and then knowing the resources to reference to build functionality. Even still, I consistently tried to do everything from memory before using references, making my coding speed slow.

 I came to develop a mental model of how Rails applications work only through pure repetition. While I consistently struggled to complete projects, I am happy that I was able to maintain the consistent work regimen that with time led to this intellectual growth.

I am very grateful for the opportunity this module to contribute to the Turing community by running two Friday Spike sessions with Courtney Meyerhofer. My feedback from my cohort mates and instructors at the end of the last module was to share my knowledge; we gave a presentation on "How Interpreters Work" and led a recursion workshop.

I'm very grateful to the Turing community and staff especially who provide this excellent learning environment and a world-class curriculum. I hope to continue to contribute to this community for years to come.

(Please Indicate if Pass/Fail/Pending)

##### Final Evaluation - Instructor: Sal Espinosa

Max Notes:
Feedback to Sal: I really appreciated the way you communicate. I can sense your genuine care for me as a student and your dedication to me achieving a learning outcome first and foremost, rather than focusing on a set of grades.

Your feedback for me was:
- Think about how to move more incrementally in the tests to build the ActiveRecord relationships.
- Good collaboration with the interviewer, especially how I asked questions that were about design decisions rather than "how do I do this" questions.

###### Evaluation Criteria

  * 4: Developer is able to describe concepts with a high degree of specificity and accuracy without assistance
  * 3: Developer is able to describe concepts with a moderately high degree of specificity and accuracy with some assistance/questioning
  * 2: Developer demonstrates some gaps in understanding when asked for additional detail
  * 1: Developer has fundamental misconceptions about Rails, MVCs, the web, or related topics

2. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

  * 3.5: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them with little assistance

3. Feature Completeness

  * 3: Developer is able to implement all functionality and all tests pass

4. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style

  * 3.5: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods with minimal support and understands the relationship between models and the database

5. Rails Style

  * 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

6. Testing

  * 3.5: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may need some assistance parsing errors or prioritizing next steps  

7. Collaboration

##### Mid-Module Evaluation - Instructor: Sal Espinosa

Max Notes: Feedback for me included being more deliberate with following the testing errors specifically and also to improve in ActiveRecord.

###### Evaluation Criteria

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

1. Conceptual Understanding

  * 3.5: Developer is able to describe concepts with a moderately high degree of specificity and accuracy with some assistance/questioning

2. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

  * 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them with little assistance

3. Feature Completeness

  * 2: Developer is missing one piece of functionality

4. Rails Syntax & API

6. Testing

  * 3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may need some assistance parsing errors or prioritizing next steps

7. Collaboration



## B: Individual Work & Projects

Slow and steady wins the race. I learned about application structure and how HTTP requests move through an MVC structure. While I consistently struggled with speed, by the end of the module I felt like I had a strong understanding the material, especially how to use feature tests to drive development. I really enjoy thinking about how the requests move through the application.

#### Mix-Master

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxglassie/mix-master.git)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mix_master/1_getting_started)

I was deep in the struggle at this point in the module. Mix Master is a substantial tutorial and I tend to move through material very deliberately. It was a challenge to get through the material because I ran into a number of tough errors that waylaid me for hours. After sticking it out for a long time trying to build the application exactly according to the tutorial, I shifted tactics to achieving the greatest learning outcome as I could with the time remaining but not concerning myself with duplicating the application exactly.

I took substantial notes in Evernote to use as reference material. It has been very valuable as a reference in following projects, since I am able to look up the patterns for key pieces of functionality.

On a conceptual level, despite the sheer frustration I experienced in this project, this was the start of real growth for me. The (re)introduction of test driven development in the tutorial, the way that feature tests started to help me understand better the patterns of HTTP requests moving through the controller-model-view (because MVC isn't the right order) were significant seeds that I later saw germinate.

#### Mini-Project: IdeaBox

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxglassie/idea_box.git)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

IdeaBox is an app to store ideas. There is a many to many relationship between images and ideas and a one to many relationship between categories and ideas. It also has authentication and authorization for users and administrators.

My consistent tendency in this module to work slowly meant that I didn't finish the functionality for this project, in particular, the images and tags components. I focused on spending my time understanding how to implement CRUD more deeply, attempting to do as much as possible from memory.

I wanted to make sure that I was able to put together the authorization and authentication piece. Getting another repetition in CRUD was really valuable, especially since I had only really started to understand how the HTTP requests moved through the application just before the mid-module assessment.

Conceptually, I really enjoyed this project because I find the manner that Rails handles authentication and authorization using namespaces and inheritance within controllers and routes to be fascinating. But like everything else this module, while I learned a lot and was able to implement the core functionality, it was a significant struggle to move through the material in a timely manner.   


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Two wonderful learning experiences. The first, Bike Share, showing the potential for an application to manage and analyze data and laying the theoretical foundation for working with routes and controllers, through the simplicity of Sinatra.

The second, Little Shop, building on that foundation of database analysis and adding in the complexities of the user being able to really interact with that data. The website delivers a service to a client in the form of a small online store and cart and checkout functionality. I'm very grateful that the app makes great use of user stories, which are at the heart of good product development and an industry standard practice.

#### Bike Share

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cmacaulay/bike-share.git)
*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/cmacaulay/bike-share/blob/master/README.md)

Bike Share is an application built in Sinatra that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco. The application both imports a large Kaggle dataset from CSV files and provides a dashboard to display this information to the user in the browser.

While I really enjoyed the material in Module 1, this project brought home just how happy I am to be at Turing and in the back end program. Building an application that can import, analyze, and present a dashboard to a user is exactly what I want to be doing.

While I struggled with aspects of the material, especially Active Record, I ended up making a solid contribution to the team, writing the CRUD functionality for weather conditions. ActiveRecord was a significant challenge; this was the first time, even with some basic background in SQL, that I was utterly defeated by methods at Turing. Looking back, I get the sense there was an issue with the relationships between our tables.

I was proud of how well our team worked together and especially grateful for Casey's leadership as project manager. We maintained a positive attitude and moved well through a significant amount of material.


###### Evaluation Rubric

Notes:

Bug with create new station
Page breaks when updating station
Date inputs for temperature fields
Links are submitting to get instead of post which breaks things
The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Functional Expectations

  1: Application is not usable

2. ActiveRecord

  3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

3. User Experience and Conventions

  3: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.

4. Code Organization/Quality

  3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/responses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.


5. Testing

  2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient


6. Working Collaboration(optional)

  3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

##### Team Feedback To Me

* Amara Lovato
    * Max, I’m glad that we had the opportunity to work together on bike share. During mod1 we didn’t interact much and I was awaiting for the moment to get to know you more. You were very organized and methodical and that helped a lot in the planning stage.
    * Honestly, I feel that the project started really well and we all had a strong will to achieve the goals and have a good communication workflow. However, during the first days we lost you in the team for a bit, first for problems with your computer that were inevitable but also because you seemed very worried and overwhelmed by not fully understand some new things that the project was requiring.
    * I get that embracing the unknown is hard but it’s part of the learning experience, at Turing often you need to try things and learn while you experiment as we are constantly given challenges that go far beyond our knowledge.
    * I really appreciate that your respectful, kind and polite attitude as well as your will to solve any misunderstanding or small tension, that showed a very mature and brave personality from your part.
    * Overall it was a good team experience for me and I hope that it was as well for you. I’d appreciate honest and constructive feedback from you if you have any recommendation of how I can improve as team member as I believe that that’s the only way that we can grow.


* Casey Macaulay
   * Max, thank you for having confidence in me to be a successful project manager for bike share. While you struggled in aspects of this project, you were still able to have perspective, a sense of humor and a work ethic which I greatly appreciated.
   * I understand the need to be driven by intellectual understanding, but think that it got in the way of code execution for you in this project. It was frustrating to pair with you, which I think you recognized. It is difficult to act as the navigator when the driver challenges you on every decision - sometimes it is best just to try something and see whether or not it works.
   * It seemed as though you would fixate on a singular issue or language that was not necessarily relevant to what we were working on, and that you were hesitant to ask for help if you were stuck on a problem for a prolonged period of time. I would suggest that you be more open to the opinions and help from others, and that you just start trying things even if full conceptual understanding isn't there.
   * This was a lesson I personally had to learn at Turing and I think would benefit you greatly. While, yes, it's great if all of that intellectual understanding is there initially, all of this material is completely new, so it has to be OK to try something while not fully, conceptually, understanding it.
   * I really enjoy having you in our cohort, and am here for you as both a resource, a friend, and as someone who also tends to intellectualize everything first.


* Cody Borders
    * Max: I got a lot of value from working on Bike Share with you, particularly pairing with you and working through those first ActiveRecord queries. I like how you take a methodical approach and try to break things down into smaller pieces, and how you'll take time to yourself to focus deeply when you're trying to grasp a concept.
    * I thought you handled your PostGres issue really well even though it was a multi-hour headache, and that you didn't let it get in the way of getting something accomplished on the project. And you read the docs!
    * During the project I observed that you'd work for extended periods of time on a single problem, which I like to do as well. I think sometimes this can be counterproductive, and that it's a good idea to take a break at least every 90 minutes to let your mind relax for a bit.

#### Little Shop

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alfosco/pog_hogs.git)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)
*   [Heroku Link](https://poghogs.herokuapp.com/)

Little Shop is aptly named. The project requirement is to build from user stories a web site that functions as an online store.

It includes authentication and authorization for administrators and users. The administrators can view a dashboard for the orders and items for the website. Users are able to place items into a cart, checkout, and place their order.

My primary piece of functionality was the shopping cart, where I struggled for a long time to get the functionality to work properly. I learned a great deal about how to manage state inside of sessions and to use POROs with SimpleDelegator to push the logic down to the views.

We worked very well together as a team, using project management tools effectively and maintaining a great sense of humor throughout.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

The primary message this exercise communicated was the power of cultural narratives and our tribal instincts to cause macro patterns to operate in society. People naturally like to avoid feeling socially anxious and so gravitate towards people who are similar to them. This minor patterns and behaviors can lead to a segregated society.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

It is very helpful to hear more about the experiences of women in tech. The "brogrammer" culture certainly has negative effects. It's clear that women face subtle and not so subtle discouragement from entering into STEM careers, starting early in their educational experience.

I do feel that there needs to be more compassion for all people and I would like to see a movement beyond gender identity in terms of how we understand meta-narratives affecting peoples lives. There are many people who are affected by culture in this way. For example, the idea of "dumb jocks" has certainly discouraged many talented people from discovering a love for programming.

#### Universal Basic Income

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

_How would you describe the "realities" of our future economy? What constraints and opportunities will we face as a nation?_

Technological advances will create as many opportunities for economic growth as they take away. The role of the state in this transition is to support people as they train and acquire education for how to ride a technological wave. My thought is that we should learn to use AI as a tool that helps us be more effective rather than see it as a replacement for people.

_What's your reaction to hearing tech leaders like Elon Musk describe UBI as a "foregone conclusion”?_

He’s a bit of a nut. Automation may dramatically change our lives, but just as AirBnb, Google, Apple, and other companies have created whole new ecosystems for economic growth, so will automation.

_Write a quick elevator pitch synthesizing what you've read from these articles: what is UBI, why is it entering policy debates, what do you think people should know about automation and its affect on our workforce?_

Universal Basic Income is the idea that all people should receive a monthly payment from the government in order to support them. It’s entering policy debates because there is fear that automation will eliminate jobs on a massive scale and people hold the opinion that the state is responsible for providing an income.

I want to know more about how automation is substantially different now than automation in the past. It seems that most of the tasks that automation will perform are boring and repetitive tasks that are not fullfilling work for the people who currently do them, and that there good reason to believe that automation will provide more opportunities in our economy than it destroys. I do believe that their should be civil efforts to support those people whose lives are effected by technological advances, but I don’t think that UBI is a viable idea. We’re already approaching unsustainable debt levels because of our current welfare programs.

_Do you think it's worthwhile to be educated about automation, its affect on our workforce, and policy solutions like UBI? What does it look like to be a responsible citizen in the face of such a large, inevitable transformation? Do you think you can really have an impact -- if not, why put energy into being informed?_

Certainly, if automation lives up to the hype, it’s important to understand what it will do and how it will effect our workforce. Policy solutions that are more realistic and more beneficial than UBI ought to be discussed.

Being a responsible citizen is first about equipping myself with the ability to use technology. There’s a community of chess players, for example, who have gained great skill in using computer and human teams to play chess. My goal is to be fluent in working with computers and bringing a human element that no level of automation will be able to replace to create value. Ultimately, all value is human value, and so automative services will need to meet human needs. Once those needs are met, then there will be new needs to fill the gaps that automation leaves; the people who predict and capitalize on those opportunities are the ones who will create the most value in the future economy - and thus employ the most people.

If anything, the goal should be to create value with automation and to seek ways to create value that are focused on our humanity, rather than shifting more responsibility onto the state for people’s lives and well being. All this transition requires a reformation in education.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### StrengthsFinder
I've found a lot of value in the StrengthsFinder survey and the work that we've done with Allison. Especially, I've found a lot of growth in understanding that I am driven by intellectual motivations. I feel that being expressive of this strength has been very helpful for me in this module and will continue to be in my professional outreach and personal drive to improve as a programmer.  

This session was helpful to me because of the positive feedback I received from Ashley Schauer, who clear that my strengths of strategy and intellection were very valuable when we worked together on CompleteMe.


#### Professional Development: Question Responses

* Paragraph reflection on project management strategies you used in your team projects; What went well? What didn’t go well?

  * We used Waffle as a project management tool on both projects and it was very effective. We also consistently conducted stand-ups to check in with each other and to offer support where it was needed. We also used those times to resolve any tensions that arose from the pressure to meet the project deadlines.

  * In Bike Share, we did not make consistent enough use of code freezes, leading to scrambling and some challenges in presenting the project to our "client" (the instructors).

* Paragraph reflection on how you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process.

  * On BikeShare: I received feedback that I am difficult to work with and my tendency to think deeply rather than to dive directly into problems made me a challenging teammate. The Johari window revealed that most people I've worked with do not see me as being a positive person.
  * I have to contextualize some of this feedback to the time and the place (one of significant burnout and personal stress) and some to a simple difference in personality. But I would like to be more expressive of the inner core of who I am. I also received feedback that I am a calm, intelligent, and hardworking person.
  * On a higher level, I took the circumstances that created this feedback as a clear sign that I needed to make a significant investment in personal growth and acted on this.   

#### Completed Flower Exercise

#### Mentorship
### Mentor Outreach
  * **Background & Strategy:** My goal is to build an API using Clojure for my module 3 personal project. I'm going to continue my strategy of outreach focused around my intellectual passion for Clojure. I love it and I recognize that there is a wonderful community who is passionate about it.

  * It's a niche language so there are fewer junior developers and I want to be a strong candidate to meet that demand. I'm also planning a broader effort to connect with my intellectual and personal mentors as I continue through the program. I am working on a post for my college blog which I feel will be helpful for networking too. I'm kicking outreach into high gear now.

  * **Outside Turing:** I reached out to a non-technical mentor who is a product manager in order to ask how product management and engineering are related. I'm committed to leveraging my past experience in human oriented design and ethics. We had a great discussion and he has promised to connect me with members of his development team for technical mentorship and connection. He also sent me excellent resources on product management.

  * **Kaitlin Barrer:** We met for lunch and she agreed to mentor me in learning Clojure. We had an excellent conversation, she gave me great resources, and we're planning to meet over break to pair for a few hours.

  * **Horace Williams:** We're going to talk next week on Monday over Screenhero. I shared with him an interesting diagram on how Clojure (LISP) macros work from the book I'm reading called "Clojure for the Brave and the True" and we're going to talk about the theory behind them.

  * **Micah Adams:** We connected because he recommended my favorite book, the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, during his talk at Turing. I have exchanged emails with the authors of the book, Hal Abelson and Gerry Sussman, and Hal sent me a silly little YouTube video. After his talk, I shared the exchange with him and he loved it. We're meeting next week because I'm planning a Spike on how to use abstraction to design programs more effectively and using material from SICP. We're going to talk about it. I'm also planning on engaging him on discussions of LISP macros in Clojure and hoping he can be a guide in developing an application.

  * **Marla Brizel:** I notice that DemocracyWorks develops in Clojure, so I reached out to see if we could get coffee. Her schedule shifted so we're postponing coffee, but she was very generous to have a long Slack exchange with me. She gave me some great resources and advice. She also said she would be available for questions. I'm going to dive into them and then follow up.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Courtney Meyerhofer:
  * Courtney, You're intellectually curious and driven to learn about computer science concepts beyond the established curriculum. That's the fancy way of saying, I'm so happy to have a partner-in-crime for talking about SICP and to explore concepts like functional programming, recursion, and how an interpreter works. We share similar passions for theory and cool technological concepts; honestly, I feel like you're one of the only people at Turing to whom I feel comfortable expressing the extremes of my nerdiness.
  * I really enjoyed working with you to put on two Spike sessions this module; not only did we contribute to the Turing community but I felt like we both learned a great deal. I was so grateful for your work to make those a success; you did a wonderful job with the Spike design, the research pieces for Ruby Under a Microscope, and conveying these complex topics.   
  * Engaging these ideas with a friend makes the journey so much more fun. I'm really looking forward to diving into Clojure with you and feel like that working together we will make something really exceptional. What I've discovered is that people who like LISP are always happy to talk; it's a fantastic way to make connections in this industry and there's a wonderful community there.
  * So glad to be friends. You're always up for my random Slack messages about LISP concepts, and that means the world to me.


### Being a Community Member
From Courtney:
  * Max, your ambition and tenacity has been apparent this module. You've taken extra steps to deepen your learning and immerse yourself in the Turing community. I appreciate that you invited me into the process of learning about interpreters, Lisp, and co-hosting spike sessions.
  * You're very inspiring in that your enthusiasm for well-constructed code and the principles of SICP is contagious. Thank you for taking the time to teach me new concepts, be a supportive friend, and be a partner in creating workshops.
  * You've taken steps to start learning new programming languages and concepts well outside of the established curriculum, and I foresee nothing but success in your future because of your motivation. I thoroughly enjoy all of my interactions with you, and I'm excited to see what you accomplish in module 3.

### Playing a Part

During my portfolio review in Module 1, when I expressed that I was looking for more intellectual depth in the material, Beth and Ilana, our instructors, suggested that I give a Spike session to share my current knowledge and find friends in the community who also enjoy that intellectual activity. I made it a priority to do so. The combined Spike sessions had an attendance of some 20 students.

Using concepts from (my favorite) book the "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by Hal Abelson and Jay Sussman and another book called "Ruby Under a Microscope," I worked with Courtney Meyerhofer to give a presentation on "How Interpreters Work" and used built in Ruby classes to look under the hood of the RVM.

Again pulling from SICP, we then collaborated to give a workshop on recursion, designing exercises in LISP to explain the key concepts for writing recursive procedures and to provide conceptual tools for people to apply directly to their own code. We also presented examples in a repo in both LISP and Ruby. [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxglassie/recursion_workshop)

We are planning on transforming these materials into a publishable format to post on our personal websites and LinkedIn in order to both share this knowledge and also to show to potential employers our ability to communicate technical concepts.

I'm planning two Spike sessions for next module on the following themes: "Abstraction and the Closure Principle: How to Design Better Programs" and "Functional Programming and The Challenges of Assignment: Why is Functional Programming Better, Really?".

I've found this to be very rewarding. I get a lot of energy from putting together the talks / workshops and reading about LISP is a great way to procrastinate. Especially, my preparations lead me to deepen my understanding of how an interpreter works, finally covering the basic content from SICP on how a register machine models the behavior of a computer. In that vein, I was fascinated to understand better how a language that allows for tail-recursion is able to operate linear recursive procedures in constant space.
