#  Amara Lovato M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main goals of this mode were to keep doing TDD in every single project as for me it’s a great tool for debugging and a guide to progress in creating better code. I wanted to have a good understanding of Active Record and Rails as well to have a solid base and expand my knowledge in mod3.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The goals of this module in individual projects were completing projects using TDD and finish with a good understanding of all the theory involved. I also wanted to thoroughly follow best practices and conventions in Ruby,  Please see below the two main individual projects in module 2.

#### Mix Master
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/pixapi/mix_master)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mix_master/1_getting_started)

### Description
MixMaster consists of an app that displays artists, songs and playlists to practice different types of relationships between tables from basic one to many relationship to more complex many to many one. The fact of practicing the CRUD in the different elements makes it a great learning project for building REST routes and the correspondent functionality in controller. I made sure to always build tests before writing in any code.

### Evaluation Comments and Scores:
This project wasn’t evaluated, we get only scores for group projects in mod2.

## Rails Mini Project
* GitHub URL(https://github.com/pixapi/wanderlust)
* Original Assignment(http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

### Description
For the mini project I decided to do my own app and experiment with Rails. As my passion and professional background is in the tourism industry I decided to build an app that gathers the best places to travel in the world built with crowdsourcing. It doesn’t include many places so far but the ones that are in the seed file were suggested by some students of Turing that love to travel. The idea is that visitors can view the destinations but cannot saved their favorites, for this you need to be logged in.  Users can suggest places through the app but will only upload after admin approval.

### Evaluation Comments and Scores:
This project wasn’t evaluated, we get only scores for group projects in mod2.


# C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
This section will display the group projects that we did during module 2. The main learning goals are working in a team, git workflow and to learn to have a good communication when it’s more than two people that it’s how we work the previous mod. And I found that the most challenging aspect of these two projects were in fact working in group and making sure that the communication was effective and everybody felt included and in the same page.

### Bike Share
* GitHub URL(https://github.com/cmacaulay/bike-share)
* Original Assignment(https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

#### Description
Bike Share project consists on using the bike share data in San Francisco build an app that among other things allows users to enter and save data related to their trips and then see information related to those trips. User can also see a dashboard for each station, enter weather information and see other analytics relevant to the bike share network and statistics related to the usage from all the users.

#### Evaluation Comments:
	•	Bug with create new station
	•	Page breaks when updating station
	•	Date inputs for temperature fields
	•	Links are submitting to get instead of post which breaks things

#### Evaluation Scores:
Assessed By: Andrew Carmer

1. Functional Expectations
	•	1: Application is not usable

2. ActiveRecord
	•	3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

3. User Experience and Conventions
	•	3: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.

4. Code Organization/Quality
	•	3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/responses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

5. Testing
	•	2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

6. Working Collaboration(optional)
	•	3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

#### Feedback for Casey:
Casey, working with you on Bike Share and having you as a project manager in our team was a great experience. I really learned from the way you are goal-oriented but always keeping a kind, supportive and understanding attitude. I know that it wasn’t easy at some moments but you kept your politeness and patience to get the best of us and adapt to the circumstances. You are a very hardworking person and have a strong will to accomplish objectives whatever the time or effort that it takes. That’s great and I’m sure that will make you learn a lot at Turing and beyond. However, by pushing yourself so hard and volunteering to do more than others can make other people take advantage of that and/or step back from challenging themselves enough and have a smaller learning experience than they could if they do more things. You have showed us to have great personal and managerial skills that combined with your will to make the world better, are going to empower you to do great things in this life.

#### Feedback from Casey:
Amara, I really enjoyed working with you on Bike Share! I really appreciated all of your support in my role as project manager, I suggest that you try being the project manager in a future project as your leadership skills are evident. You were extremely driven throughout the process to make sure the whole team was communicating and on the same page. Your work ethic and tenacity were extremely evident, and you displayed grit in both debugging your own errors, and those of other team mates. While it was helpful that you were constantly communicating, as an introvert sometimes it was just a little bit too much. I would suggest talking about introversion/extroversion with future teammates during your DTR to set some guidelines about how long to have non-technical related conversations because at times it detracted from getting work done. That being said, I would not have been able to get through the project without your kindness and your willingness to listen. When you perceive that some team mates are not pulling their weight, and not willing to listen, in the future it might be best to focus your frustrations on finishing your own work so that you might have more time to help
them - I think we both could have done better in this regard. I am so glad we had the chance to work together and hope to work with you again in the future!

#### Feedback for Cody:
Cody, it was a pleasure to work with you and I think that you were a great addition to our team in terms of attitude and work ethic. I especially enjoyed the time when we paired together to figure out how to build the seed file, you were very easy-going and resourceful. I feel that you have very good ideas but you don’t share them often enough so we missed opportunities in problems that you might had the solutions for. I encourage you to raise more your voice and tell your team mates what you think suggesting some things to try. You really balanced our personalities and brought calmness to the team in some tense moments that inevitably happened so that’s highly appreciated. Believe in yourself and show more what you know that is much more that you are aware of.

#### Feedback from Cody:
Amara, it was great working with you on the Bike Share project. I enjoyed exchanging ideas with you while we paired, and I think we both gained a lot from it. Your outgoing personality and upbeat attitude really helped keep the group motivated and focused on our goals in spite of the challenges we faced. I'm impressed with your ability to balance being both a mother and a Turing student -- it's quite an accomplishment to be able to handle both at the same time. When working on future projects I encourage you to keep your eye the big picture and not let yourself stress over individual things you aren't quite satisfied with. During our Bike Share project I noticed you were really intent on completing the project -- which is understandable and a good attitude to have -- but in focusing on finishing we may miss opportunities to maximize our learning. That didn't happen on Bike Share, but it's something to keep in mind in the future.

#### Feedback for Max:
Max, I’m glad that we had the opportunity to work together on bike share. During mod1 we didn’t interact much and I was awaiting for the moment to get to know you more. You were very organized and methodical and that helped a lot in the planning stage. Honestly, I feel that the project started really well and we all had a strong will to achieve the goals and have a good communication workflow. However, during the first days we lost you in the team for a bit, first for problems with your computer that were inevitable but also because you seemed very worried and overwhelmed by not fully understand some new things that the project was requiring. I get that embracing the unknown is hard but it’s part of the learning experience, at Turing often you need to try things and learn while you experiment as we are constantly given challenges that go far beyond our knowledge. I really appreciate that your respectful, kind and polite attitude as well as your will to solve any misunderstanding or small tension, that showed a very mature and brave personality from your part. Overall it was a good team experience for me and I hope that it was as well for you. I’d appreciate honest and constructive feedback from you if you have any recommendation of how I can improve as team member as I believe that that’s the only way that we can grow.

#### Feedback from Max:
Dear Amara:
I'm constantly amazed by your energy and positivity. You're driven and goal oriented in your approach and did a fantastic job of moving quickly through code.
You're quite skilled from a technical perspective. I'd like to especially point out your attention to detail and how that enables you to stamp out bugs. I was very grateful to you when you were able to consistently jump in and put out fires for our team.
My tendency in moments of stress is to slow down, chill out, and become more methodical. I'm very driven by intellectual motivation and like to talk
conceptually for a long time prior to diving into code. I understand that can be
frustrating in a project setting but I encourage you as you develop as a lead to think about how to use someone with my personality type effectively.
Personally, I would prefer more direct feedback and encourage you to get more comfortable in expressing that feedback in person, both the positive and
especially the constructive. There were moments in a group setting where you
framed your comments in terms of generalities, but I felt you were speaking
specifically to me. If you have courage and express those thoughts directly you
will be a more effective team mate.
Overall, I really enjoyed working with you and felt that you made a significant
contribution to the team. I am especially grateful for your patience and
kindness with me, given that I had low energy levels and was dealing with some
external stresses.
I hope that we get a chance to work together again and also, maybe a chance to
travel in distant lands and build technology together.
Abrazo!

## Little Shop
* GitHub URL(https://github.com/TheKaterTot/education_gives)
* Original Assignment(http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

### Description
For our little shop we decided to create a real and altruistic case and we built an app to fund a school called Pearl Lagoon Academy of Excellence in RAAS Region in Nicaragua. The visitor can add donations to the cart but can’t checkout without register or log in. Donations have categories (music, science, library) that correspond to the specific topic that the donation is for such as buy a violin for the school belongs to music category. User can see previous orders. Admin has access to admin dashboard with analytics of the status of orders and specific details of each order such as user full name, when it was created and donations included in that order. We use Bcrypt to protect the password, Factory Girl for test purposes and Paperclip for images.

### Feedback for Katy:
Katy, I think that you were an excellent addition to our team for your personality and team work attitude. You were polite, calm, patient and respectful all the time in spite of some triggering situations that inevitably happened, you always kept calm. I’m very impressed for your active listening and will to make peace, they definitely help us in solving possible miscommunications and misunderstandings. I appreciate that you purposely spent more time that you naturally would have in working in pairs/team, that shows a strong will in becoming an even better developer and gave me a great opportunity to learn from your experience and knowledge. Honestly I want to have something to say for improvement but I can’t think of any because you gave your best and were an awesome team member and person to work with. Thanks for this fabulous experience, it was 11 in a scale of 10.

#### Feedback from Katy:
Amara:
I really enjoyed working with you on Little Shop. I appreciated your determination to take on any problem, and your positivity through the project. You were very supportive of my work, and you asked great questions that led us to better solutions. In the future, I’d like to see you believe in your own ability as much as you believe in others’; you had great ideas about implementation and testing. Thank you for being a great PM on this project.

### Feedback for Edilene:
Edilene, working with you was so easy and pleasant that I feel that we have done that for all our lives. Your positive and tenacious attitude is extraordinary, you never get scared of challenges but embraced them with excitement. You volunteered for things that you weren’t familiar with to get the most out of the learning experience and worked really hard in spite of any circumstances. I really like your great empathy and will to make things smoother, that are some of the wonderful skills that make you a one-of-a-kind team member. You have lots of energy and that was great for the team in moments of tiredness but sometimes in the excitement to try to solve things and move forward, you had a spike of energy and I feel that it stopped you from thinking in perspective and listen to others suggestions as well as to other to express their ideas. However, when somebody brought it to your attention you acknowledged it and quickly switched to a more relaxed mode. It was a great team experience and I’m thankful that we were assigned to work together because you were very encouraging, supportive and inspiring. Your team work spirit, your interpersonal skills and your strong will to learn will make you a matchless developer and an awesome addition to any company that is so lucky to hire you.

#### Feedback from Edilene:
I'm so happy we finally worked in a project together!!!! You are so energetic and conscious of making all of us feeling validated making you the perfect choice for Project Manager for the Little Shop project. You did an awesome job keeping us on track and reconciling any issues that came up while being respectful of personalities.

I've been fortunate to see you evolving into a great developer and it would love for you to have more fun with newer and unusual codes/methods. This would introduce you to new ways of solving issues, becoming an even more amazing developer.

In a community level, your passion to make this world better can be felt through your ethics and acceptance of others. Please continue working hard on making Turing a more inclusive community and exposing us to a multicultural experience.

### Feedback for Ashley:
Ashley, it was great working with you and I was happy for this opportunity as we didn’t interact much before and I really wanted to get to know you more. I appreciate that you were honest and communicative all the time, that helped to not have any misunderstanding or miscommunication. I really enjoyed when we paired together to work on one of the first issues and you let me own the keyboard while you were navigating and making sure we were in the same page, it was a great learning experience. I’m aware that you have more experience developing that other team members and probably that makes you envision faster which solutions to use to tackle code challenges. However, this previous background or confidence made you sometimes had strong opinions about strategies and you were very defensive to your ideas and highly critical to some alternative ideas that were suggested. You already expressed that in the DTR and that was useful when these moments came so it’s good that you are aware of it. We all can learn from others no matter what the experience, knowledge or background that they come from, having different perspectives and personalities makes it a richer experience. I encourage you to embrace this diversity and try to get the most out of what each team member has to offer as it’s part of the learning that we all get from each team project. It was a good experience and I feel that we learned a ton of things for having you in it. I hope that you also enjoyed it and I wish you the best in your career and life in general.

## D: Professional Skills

The goals of these sessions are to improve our soft skills such as communication, personal branding, being a good team member or resilience. They also provide a reflective space to discuss civics and other topics as people, team mates and professionals.

## Gear Up
### Tragedy of the Commons
(https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
If tech executives and tech companies in general don’t actively work on recruiting pursuing heterogeneity, the tech industry would never be diverse and consequently they will lose a big potential in terms of connecting with their clients and developing for them. Diversity quotas might not seem fair to some people and are obviously not a perfect solution but they make companies to think of hiring people with a broader scope in mind and do something about it. That produces more opportunities for a bigger demographic and opens the scope in terms of hiring. However, other factors should be taken into account when hiring like qualifications and experience. In other words, if there are two people that are equally qualify for the position choosing the one that brings more diversity to your team is always positive because it enriches the resources and consequently the outcome. Having an inclusive culture is also important as you need to make all the members of the company welcomed and be flexible about the different mindsets, needs and work styles that they have.

### Debugging the Gender Gap
(https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)
The documentary was interesting for learning about cases working in tech. Some stories were very inspiring like seeing female leaders ruling the change in the industry but others were sad and worrying like the girl made suggestions of how to make the company less male-oriented and was even getting life threats for voicing it out. I’m sure that the real world will have a combination of both, hopefully more positive experiences than not but it’s good to be aware of some situations than can happen. Nowadays there are many initiatives that can support
us in our careers and we should go with braveness, confidence and an attitude to transform the world with code without loosing our personal essence.

### Universal Basic Income
(https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)
The realities for our future economy is that robots make workforce less necessary and we need to invest in more training/skills for people to do jobs that are available and tasks that are more complex. I feel that changes need to be done and that everybody should have the resources and opportunities to make a living. We should find the way to create new jobs because it’s not only the right way to do but also if more people have enough money to live, they spend more money and the whole economy benefits. In Denmark for instance they study annually the workforce needed in their country and they create specific training courses for that, by the end of it, they get a job. Last but not least, people need to consume responsibly and choose companies/products that are in line with their ideals, maybe those who are socially conscious would make a difference in companies looking for other things than profit.

### Professional Development Workshops

### Plan to reach Mentor/Alumni
I personally have several mentors who I meet or talk regularly to tackle different topics. There are a few of mentors/alumni who are moms  that are a great resource when I feel the guilt for not spending enough time with my daughter. Then a Spanish alumnus whom I communicate via e-mail to learn more about the European tech industry and get tips about how to performance better in Turing. And I also have a mentor whom I meet in person sometimes to work on technical issues. I never had a bad experience with Turing mentors but it’s true that you need to find the ones that you connect more with and can support you better during this challenging program.

### Blog Post in our personal site
Code for a better world
The other day a classmate gave a fascinating talk about Mobile Apps in developing countries and it made me feel full of excitement thinking of the idea of collaborate with some tech initiatives to make many people's lives better, my end goal when joining Turing.

We often develop with a certain user in mind and taking for granted that they will have similar needs and lifestyle but we definitely don't think of people with limited internet connection and in a total different life conditions that the ones we live in.
It especially touched my heart a project called <a href="http://www.giftedmom.org/index.html"> Gifted Moms</a> that tries to end the high rates of infant mortality in developing countries. It's an app that helps mothers and pregnant women to access medical advice in rural communities like reminders of vaccination appointments, sex education and when is crucial to visit the doctor for.

There are many other cool projects like <a href="http://www.bookly.co.za/">bookly</a> that is a mobile reading and writing platform built to improve literacy in Africa and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.okb.crossybricks&hl=es"> Cross Dakar City</a>that is an educational video game about the perils of Dakar's roads.

As developers we often get dazzled by the glamorous culture of tech companies, the good salaries of the industry and building fancy applications that people will talk about. However, we forget that tech is everywhere and can improve the world. We can be the agents of change, hope and positive transformation.

### Strengths Finder
I feel that I could have done a better use of it. My empathy and accepting side have been noticed and appreciated. However, I haven’t maximize my positivity at all because I get very frustrated when I get stuck in things. I also should be more confident about my knowledge and comfortable with my unknown so I can apply my woo and activator spirit to the team and take more a leading role. My connectedness has helped my teams to find resources outside and I have performed as a team builder that is something I really enjoy.

Being new to this field and not having much experience or previous knowledge makes me feel insecure sometimes. Meeting other’s people expectations and being seen as reliable are important to me so I often don’t take enough risks as I’m worried that I can’t accomplish what I committed to.

### The Flower Diagram
(https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/files/Career%20Unit%20-%20The%20Flower%20Diagram.pdf)

#### Link to Completed Deliverables:
##### My Values and Goals
I want to work in a company that contributes somehow to make people happier and/or the world more sustainable.
My goals are having working on creative projects, have a good family-work balance, working on a supportive and collaborative environment and having available a good mentorship system to grow professionally.

##### My Favorite People to work with
Working on a team with open-minded and friendly people who enjoy working and interact with others.
It would be a plus if people are from different countries as I feel is more enriching and would fit even better.

##### Preferred Places to live
France and specifically middle-size Southern cities like Montpellier.

##### Most Valuable Knowledges/Fields of interest
Client-oriented design, accessibility.

##### Transferable Skills
I speak 5 languages (Spanish, Catalan, English, French and Italian).
I have over 10 years of experience with international clients and I have a broad knowledge of cultural diversity.

##### My Favorite Working Conditions
A company where there isn’t a rigid hierarchy and employees’ opinions are listened.
It’s also important to me that the office has windows as I work more productively when there is natural light.

##### My Preferred pay and Level of Responsibility
It’s hard to tell what it’s the salary range in France for junior developers, maybe 40.000 euros to start would be reasonable.
Regarding to responsibility, I don’t want to be in charge of other people.

### Agile Practices & Project Management
(https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/agile_practices_project_management.md)

#### Takeaways from session:
I think that working with an Agile approach shows to have a growth mindset and be adaptable to our client needs in a more efficient way vs the waterfall that is more rigid to changes and all is planned beforehand. Nowadays more than ever is very important to do constant iteration and make products that are customized and client-oriented design as there are so many options in the market that users won’t adapt to our tools but will only choose the ones that are more
user friendly and satisfy their expectations. My favorite principle of Agile manifesto is the one that talks about that developers are motivated individuals and companies provide the environment, trust and support to work. In terms of
management tools, Waffle was a good discovery and I must admit that although it requires time in maintenance is really effective in delegating tasks and keeping the team informed of how the project progresses. In my last project (Little Shop) I was the project manager and I tried to have a supportive and communicative management style. I think that it went pretty well as by encouraging people they feel supported and work in a better mood. However, the communicative style and trying to make sure that we all were making decisions together made it a little bit slow to move forward but everybody felt it was a team effort.

### Feedback II
(https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/feedback_ii.md)

#### Takeaways from session:
I’m happy that I was aware of most of the characteristics that team mates expressed in their feedback and that normally people have even a better image of the one that you have of yourself so that’s very motivating. However we all need to work on improvements and each team experience is an opportunity for that. Providing specific and constructive feedback is important to grow.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### To Lucy Conklin:
Lucy, you bring light and cheerfulness to the Turing community. In spite of the stress, big workload or any problems you face you always keep calm and super positive, your attitude is definitely one-of-a-kind. I really appreciate your encouragement and your will to help with whatever I need. Having you around is great because you can switch anybody’s mood for the good and you are very supportive so that makes a positive difference during Turing. Thanks a lot for your optimistic view and your endless energy to cheer me up.

#### To Mark Van Akkeren:
Mark, your tenacious and resilient attitude is admiring. You always keep a positive perspective and inspire us all about how to never give up and try to make ourselves better. I have seen you at the school working for long hours and doing over and over exercises without never complaining about it, always pushing yourself to keep trying and learning. You should be very proud of where you are right now because of that endless effort and will to improve that you put for it. I’m sure that your hard work, charming personality and your many personal skills will make you get whatever you aim. Never change, my friend, you are awesome.

#### From Lucy Conklin:
You really have a gift for bringing people together, and I can’t wait to see the cool opportunities you create for yourself. You are the life of any room you are in, and never afraid to give your honest and constructive opinion. Keep the energy up next mod. Hopefully you will agree that it is a bit more flexible timewise. I would encourage you to seek some critical feedback on your idea for the Mod3 project. You’ll be able to both focus your wonderful enthusiasm and also pare the project down to something functional, beautiful, and socially responsible.

#### From Mark Van Akkeren:
n my first pass thru Mod1 Amara was a rock for me. While I struggled to even begin to grasp concepts she was patient and didn’t judge my inability. Even in my second time around she's been incredibly giving and has volunteered her ear and mind to my struggles with school and with code.  Like the other parents in the school I am in awe of their ability to balance their duties at home and at school with the avalanche of material that we are loaded up with.  She’s always there to listen or for a well timed hug, any day with an Amara smile is a better day.  She lifts the spirit of the entire basement.

### Being a Community Member


### Playing a Part
This module I co-lead Hamilton posse with and we planned and worked in some projects such as the Turing mentor app, a mini job fair and an interactive map.
I also actively participated in the group Tech Diversity and we met once a week to share experiences and come with ideas to make Turing a more diverse school as well as the local tech industry.
We are working on a Diversity Panel to bring together students, alumni, mentors and developers that represent diversity to discuss about the topic and it would be open to everybody who wants to attend
as we also want to reach out the general community. As I’m planning to move to Europe and I noticed that many people are interesting in working abroad, I started the channel Turing International to talk about tech trends globally,
post international opportunities and provide a place where people can ask questions and share contacts abroad for the whole Turing community. In this line, as a personal project I’d like to build an app called Turing in the World map that will collect and display information of mentors, alumni and Turing supporters in an international scope, I already talked to Jeff and seems excited about the idea so hopefully I will gather data so when I have the skills to build it I’ll have the info ready. I want it to make a front-end/back-end team effort so I will look for synergies in both programs for a more meaningful experience and better result.

## Final Review

### Outcome
