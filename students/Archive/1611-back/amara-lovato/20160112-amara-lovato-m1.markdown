#  Amara Lovato M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My areas of emphasis were mainly fully understand and a correct use of Ruby basics (classes, methods, instances, OOP) and being able to successfully complete a project always doing TDD. In order to do that, I focused on reading books about Ruby, practicing the drills in a daily basis as well going over the lesson plans and homework. I also made sure to have regular pairing sessions with my mentor David Maurer to go through specific concepts that I was struggling with and practice them in exercises in order to feel confident using them. Helping my classmates also was one of my goals to help them understand the new concepts that I already understand and also as a way for me to review them and get to know my unknowns so I can fill these gaps looking for answers.

#### Credit Check
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/pixapi/credit_check)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/credit_check.markdown)

### Description
Credit Check consists in applying the Luhn algorithm in order to validate a credit card number. It’s a great project to practice manipulating different types of data structures in Ruby and I decided to do several versions, one without classes nor methods and the other one using TDD, classes and methods.

### Evaluation Comments and Scores:
This is the project that I was assigned as a member of the Foxtrot group. But we didn’t get feedback nor had an evaluation session for it.

## Sorting Suite
* GitHub URL(https://github.com/pixapi/sorting_suite)
* Original Assignment(https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

### Description
Sorting Suite consists of sorting algorithms to implement three types of sorting
numbers: bubble sort, insertion sort and merge sort. Bubble sort orders the
numbers by running each number from left to right until the next number is
bigger so it stops there. Insertion Sort orders the numbers by moving them into
a temporary holder (array) and once sorted moving them to a final sorted array.

### Evaluation Comments and Scores:
In addition to do the project credit check, I decided to do bubble sort as well to challenge myself and try something new as I had already done credit check project before. We didn’t get feedback nor had an evaluation session for it.

## Jungle Beat
* GitHub URL(https://github.com/pixapi/jungle_beat)
* Original Assignment(http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat)

### Description
Jungle Beats consists of building a drum machine that plays sounds using a linked list as a data structure. The linked list is composed by nodes and each node only knows about the existence of next node but not the next node doesn’t know about the previous node. We add new nodes to the list using append method to add to the end of the list and prepend method to add to the front. We can also insert nodes in a certain position as well as count the elements of the list and see if it includes a certain element. I also build the two extensions that were correctly working: one to reject to add elements when they were not included in the valid beats and the second extension was for the user to choose the voice and the speed of how beats were played.

### Evaluation Comments:
Assessed By: Ilana
33 tests all passing
talked about refactoring
talked about testing all the methods

### Evaluation Scores:

#### 1. Functional Expectations
4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

#### 2. Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
2.5: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

#### 5. Looping or Recursion
3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

## Battleship
* GitHub URL(https://github.com/pixapi/battleship)
* Original Assignment(http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

### Description
Battleship consists of building a program to play the game battleship against the computer. The user has access to a menu, setting up ships and fire computer ships to try to sink them, the computer also fires user ships. This project is a good practice of breaking a long coding process into small pieces, interconnecting classes, developing the REPL and store information to keep track of the game progress of each player (computer vs ai). A big challenge is the use TDD from the start and along the project and a good tool to make sure that the structure of the code is correct and classes meet the single responsibility principle.

### Evaluation Comments:
Assessed By: Ilana

## Wizarding Bank
* GitHub URL(https://github.com/pixapi/wizarding_bank)
* Original Assignment(https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/wizarding_bank.markdown)

### Description
Wizarding Bank project consists in building a program that allows create bank accounts in different banks for several people that have initially certain cash. The program also performs the normal bank operations: withdrawal, transfer money between account and keep track of the balances in each account. The primary learning goal is the use of classes, methods and passing info around through arguments and variables.

### Evaluation Comments/Scores
This was an exercise to work on and send the repo link to the instructors. We never got feedback nor an evaluation session for it.

# C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
This section will display the pair projects that we did during module 1. The main learning goals are the technical knowledge and use of Ruby but also and as important as this was doing TDD and how to work with somebody in a project. In order to perform well working in pairs, there is an initial discussion called DTR (Define the Relationship) where pairs talk about how are their styles to work, schedules and other factors that condition their good performance; at the end of the discussion they achieve a compromise and determine some rules for a good workflow.

### Enigma
* GitHub URL(https://github.com/pixapi/enigma)
* Original Assignment(http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

#### Description
Enigma project consists of building a program that simulates the encryption method used during the Cold War. The system rotates characters and numbers in a way that having the key and knowing the rotations allows to decrypt the message. However, there is a way to do it without the key that's called to crack the message. The goal of this project was to do the first part of the solving process that is the whiteboarding/pseudocoding,  focusing on identifying classes and their attributes.

#### Evaluation Comments:
testing was a little bit of a struggle, had a hard time figuring out how to test in a robust way. talked about how to set information so it is easier to manage and manipulate.
talked about some refactoring that could have been done and the use of instance variables.
ran encrypt and decrypt, working on crack.

#### Evaluation Scores:
Assessed By: Ilana

#### 1. Overall Functionality
2: Application is missing one of the three operations

#### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

#### 3. Test-Driven Development
2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage

#### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

#### Feedback from Ryan:
I think that you were a great partner Amara, and I really enjoyed working with
you. From day 1, we laid out what our goals were and communicated effectively
throughout the entirety of the project. You worked so hard on the project, and
were immensely helpful to me. When you took the driver seat in writing code, you
went at a pace that I could understand and would explain things to me when I
didn’t understand. You also pushed me to really understand, and ask for help
when I didn’t instead of letting it go.
As the project progressed and the intensity turned up, I felt that sometimes pessimism got to you…that you didn’t think the goal was in reach and you felt that you needed to double down and do even more work. I feel like this caused you to make some mistakes and that some stubbornness kept us from tackling the problem head on. You were totally aware of this and mentioned it to me several times whenever you thought you had let the pessimism get to you. For me, that sense of urgency that came out kept me from asking you some questions as I didn’t want to bog you down or seem stupid when you were on a tear.
On a brighter note, you also opened me up to pairing. I was originally a little apprehensive to initiate a pairing, but you were right on pairing from day 1 and helped me be comfortable asking literally anyone sitting around for help. I got to meet some great people through that, and I really appreciate you taking me under your “coding” wing. I learned so much from you and wish you nothing but success during the rest of the program…your future partners will be lucky to have you!

#### Feedback to Ryan:
''Ryan, it was a pleasure working with you. I’m impressed of the constant effort that you put in understanding concepts and looking for solutions to the challenges that we were facing. I also liked your positive attitude and stress control, it’s admiring that you never lost your focus or freaked out in spite of the complexity and the time constraint, that was very helpful in keeping the mindset to succeed. I want to suggest that you ask your next partner more questions, if you don’t fully understand something make the other person know for clarifications and explanation. In fact, asking questions is an excellent way to as a team reevaluate strategies, and generate solutions. Believe in yourself, you know more than you think and your logic understanding is very good.  Don’t hesitate to provide ideas and alternative approaches, the times when you did that during our project, we solved problems easier and generated better code.  Last but not least, your team work spirit is hard to match and your will to have an open and continuous communication made the workflow smooth and efficient. Thanks for a great pair project experience!''

## Headcount
* GitHub URL(https://github.com/pixapi/headcount)
* Original Assignment(https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

### Description
Headcount consists on analyzing some public data about schools in Colorado in relation to other variables to combine them and see the relationships as a result. We handle information about things like kindergarten enrollment, high_school graduation, median household income or children in poverty by district  to see the possible connections and impacts of ones over the others. The project was a big challenge in terms of working on a big project by doing small steps but having in mind the big picture, sanitizing data or making accessible data was nested under many other structural layers. It was a big learning and struggle sometimes but it was very meaningful to be dealing with real data and feeling to getting a bit more ready for the real world.

### Evaluation Comments:

### Feedback from Alex:
Amara, I had a great experience pairing with you on headcount. The project was very difficult and frustrating at times but I thought we made a great team and we were able to overcome all the obstacles that were thrown at us. I'm pretty amazed at how much we both learned by the end of the project, and I appreciate that you helped me learn these new skills. If we had one more day I know we could have finished iteration 6.
There is one habit you have that I think you can improve on. There were a lot of occasions where we would come across an error or a problem and you would ask other people for help before investigating the problem and finding where it was happening. If you just took a little more time to pry into your files and identify where it was happening I believe you could have solved some of the problems on your own. The people who you were asking for help would probably also appreciate it if the pry 'dirty work' was already done before they looked at it so they could just focus on our logic.
You had an incredible drive and determination to solve each problem we were faced with, and I could clearly see that you have a passion for this profession. Keep this mentality, continue to practice and I'm sure you will have a successful career in software development. After working with you closely the past nine days, I think you are definitely ready for module 2 of Turing and I'm sure our instructors will see that too. Great job! I look forward to pairing with you again.  

### Feedback to Alex:
Alex has been an awesome pair to work with because of his personality and
extraordinary team work mindset. He has tons of patience, a bright analytical
mind and he handles his emotions and stress in an admirable way. He brings many
other talents to our team such as attention to detail, resourcefulness, and
positive attitude. He never seems bother for anything nor anyone and he is
always eager to help others even if he is in the middle of figuring out a
complex problem: he stops, offers them a smile and his full attention to
whatever people need. He is very humble and approachable what makes being around
him really nice, however he has much more knowledge that he thinks and should
trust more in himself. He not only has an incredible background that shows his
personal strengths and resilience but also has many talents that he seems to
take for granted but are extraordinary. He is tenacious, very hardworking and
never complains about problems, just stays calm and keep trying. Alex is a
one-of-a-kind team partner and he makes any challenge to face meaningful and
fun. Without doubt, this has been the most team spirit experience that I have
had in Turing, and I can’t wait to work with him again in next mods.

## D: Professional Skills

The goals of these sessions are to improve our soft skills such as communication, personal branding, being a good team member or resilience. They also provide a reflective space to discuss civics and other topics as people, team mates and professionals.

## Gear Up
### Growth Mindset #
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown

The growth mindset session was a good opportunity to reflect about if we are trying to keep this attitude. For me, being aware that we naturally tend to have a fix mindset helps to fight it and thinking that other people like me have succeed gives me confidence. Stress and frustration triggers my pessimism and lures me to the idea of going back to a field that I’m comfy at. However, remembering myself why I am here, makes me want to work harder and get over myself. Other strategies that have helped me has been surrounding myself by people with resilience and a positive attitude, thinking that grades measure your work but not your person and feeling proud of myself for being brave enough to try new and challenging things. Connecting with upper modules and alumni who tell you what they went through is also inspiring and encouraging.

### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown

That was an opening-eye session for me. Being an extroverted I never could
imagine how introverts could feel in daily situations. I enjoyed the TED talk
about this topic and made me understand previous situations that I had with some
of my friends or family that are introverts. For example, I couldn't imagine
that somebody could feel tired after socializing for a couple of hours, that
some people prefer to go home and read instead of going to a party to meet
people or that some silent time is a necessity for others. I felt bad for having
tried some of my friends to be more extroverted or expose to things that
probably they weren't comfortable with but now that I know that, I will ask them
and others before assuming things because we all are different and that's the
charm of this world. I especially liked this time the activity of meeting some
other people of your personality type (fully extroverts in my case) as well as
two people who consider themselves introvert and exchange experiences and
insight.

### Personal Story/Public Narrative#
(https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_personal_story.markdown)

The personal story session was a very meaningful session as I got to know better three people of my cohort. Sharing our stories about what brought us here, what are our values and what we do about it was a great way to connect with our small group mates. We discovered that we had many goals in common as providing opportunities to improve the digital literacy, technology as a tool to improve the world, see more female in tech and be a role model for other minorities to join the IT industry.

### Grit
(https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
This session was my first exposure to the term grit and it was interesting to know other people’s approach about it. I believe that grit is being tenacious, keep motivated towards a goal and work hard to achieve it. However, I never thought about what it is required to really be successful and don’t give up and honestly it was a surprise to know that it can be learned as I thought that it was a personal skill that you have or not. I enjoyed watching the Ted talk about it and I’m hopeful that education and society in general will find new ways to keep kids engage in learning, be participative and become better people in life.

### Professional Development Workshops
### Personal Branding Part I
(http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/personal_branding_p1)

#### Link to Completed Deliverables:
* Resume(https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2f2Ue41XP8kZGdFYTQxa2dKWFk/view)
* LinkedIn Profile(https://www.linkedin.com/in/amaralovato)
* Twitter Account(https://twitter.com/amaralovato)
* GitHub Profile(https://github.com/pixapi)

#### Takeaways from session:
I agree that branding ourselves is telling a consistent story about us. Many times we see branding as something superficial (like a traditional cold networking event) or trying to project a perfect image pretending to be what we don’t really are. However, the real goal is to make people know us, connect with them finding values in common and enhance the best of us. Our brand is not only our resume or dressing elegant for our interview, we define who we are by many ways (such as when using Twitter, our LinkedIn profile or when attending a conference) so we need to be wise and behave appropriately if we want to create a good impression as a whole. In fact, as software developers, there are two elements that project who we are as professionals: our github portfolio and, as I’ve been told my mentors, participating in open source projects so peers and recruiters can see our work and ethics. Companies look more for good team members who share their values and fit in their culture more than extraordinary developers in a technical way.

### Learning to Pair
http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/learning_to_pair

#### Link to Completed Deliverables:
* DTR Memo(https://turingschool.slack.com/files/pixapi/F3M96MMRD/dtramara_ryan.pdf)

#### Takeaways from session:
The DTR (Define The Relationship) is a useful tool to guarantee having a good experience when working with other people in a project. Some of the aspects that should be discussed are what time both work better, what are your strengths and concerns about the project, what are your learning goals and what can help you or stop you from being successful in the project. Once each part has shared their perspective, the goal is to define a guideline that works for both and to use during the pair project period. It was good to know that my pair had the same approach of teamwork, holding each other accountable, open communication and discuss problems immediately when they arise.

### Feedback I
(http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/feedback_1)

#### Link to Completed Deliverables:
Please see Feedback section in portfolio for feedback for and from project partners.

#### Takeaways from session:
What I found more useful from this session was to specify to the person that you want to provide you feedback what you are especially interested to hear about. Another good piece of advice is when facing a feedback situation always start talking about what went well and then transition smoothly to what could be improved. Giving feedback that is specific and providing examples that illustrate your ideas will make it more useful and easier to understand.  It's also advisable to give it in a constructive way by providing solutions so people don't feel receiving a problem but a way to improve. The activity of reading our feedback draft to other people in our group was a good help for getting suggestions of how to provide better feedback to our pairs.

### Personal Branding II
(https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p2.md)

#### Link to Completed Deliverables:
We were asked to work on the content of our personal website. No immediate deliverable for this session.

#### Takeaways from session:
We learned that we don’t need to think of any specific audience when telling our story but imagine talking to ourselves to feel less nervous about it and be authentic. Having this mindset feels a relieve because it’s hard to choose what to say about yourself, we are so many things. Another tip was to show all our parts: who we are as professionals, community members and humans. The emphasis on having a call to action on your website instead of only displaying your contact details was also a useful tip. Believe or not, our website is our window store and we don’t need to only look good (site style, content, projects) so people like us but we also need to create the next step for them to contact us suggesting them how.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### To Maria Stenquist:
Maria, it is such a pleasure to have you in our cohort with your positive attitude and incredible life experiences that makes worth it repeating only for the opportunity to have met you. I love the humbleness that you have in spite of all your education and knowledge, I will never forget you saying “Turing is harder than learning how to fly a plane”, you really know how to boost other people's self-esteem. Working with you on drills was also a great experience, your collaborative pairing workflow is matchless and I am sure that in the professional scene you will thrive in any team. You definitely have interpersonal skills and connect with people immediately, your listening skills and empathy are fabulous. I also admire your will to always share resources with us. I remember when I mentioned that I might look for a remote job once I finish the program and you stopped working on a project to take all the time in the world to show me right away good sites for that and looking for many more. In addition to that, you are always eager to share with us your contacts in the local tech community and good tips when looking for a job, that is very encouraging and highly appreciated.  You are always very resourceful and generous, I love it. Honestly, since the moment that I met you, I clicked with you because you create a pleasant, familiar and warm vibe that makes everybody happier and chill. To sum up, you are a fantastic classmate, a great friend and you will be a priceless developer for all the qualities that you have. Thanks for being so awesome.

#### To Jason Conrad:
Jason is such a committed and great member of the Turing community. He is always eager to give you a hand and answer any question about Ruby, projects and the school in general. He is also well informed of what’s going on and if he doesn’t know he finds out to provide you that information. In addition to that,  as last mod he plays a relevant role connecting mods and students/staff. He is always available on Slack and it’s so fast answering, he has been definitely a SOS person in many occasions for me. He is very supportive with other students, especially when they are personally struggling and feeling anxious about the possibility to repeat. He listens to them with attention, shares his experience and give you arguments about the benefits of doing what’s better for you having a growth mindset to adapt your initial plans. He is definitely a inspiring person and great friend to many of us.

#### To Casey Macaulay:
Casey is a fantastic addition to our cohort as she is full of joy, enthusiasm and has a big heart. She is passionate and committed with social causes, especially education and opportunity disparities, and I really admire her will and pursue of making the world better. She is very talented in providing a good atmosphere and conflict resolution, if there has been any tense moment in a cohort, she has always being working on making peace by listening to both sides and trying to bring people together. She is hardworking and never give up in spite of the struggle, in fact, she embraces it as an opportunity to learn. She has always a big smile to make your day brighter and a can-I-help-you offer in any problem that you have. I’m sure that she will make a positive impact in the world, she is bright, good-hearted and has the grit to do it until she achieves it.

### Being a Community Member

#### From Maria Stenquist:
Amara, I remember on the first day of class when we were taking a pomodoro break that you looked up with this huge grin on your face. Little did I know just how supportive you would be to me through these hectic first 6 weeks of Turing. I am super grateful for your friendship, mentorship, and encouragement throughout Module 1, and it was great to work with you on drills and exercises over the holiday break. You are always so positive and understanding of others in the cohort, and you certainly are a magnet for positivity and energy: it is contagious to those around you. When others are stressed to the hilt, you know how to relate to that person to calm the stress nerves and provide some comic relief!! You tackle code challenges head on, and know how to use your resources. I have seen tremendous improvement in how you approach organizing code over these weeks, and others in the class recognize this and come to you for assistance--which you gladly give. You often posted comments on Slack to help bring the cohort together, and you always made sure that nobody felt isolated/alone. In a sense you are the 'glue' to the cohort, and I know several of the students are grateful for initiatives!! Encouraging our cohort as a group will be a valuable skill when facing dev teams, clients, others in the tech field, and peers. Un abrazo amiga!!

#### From Casey Macaulay:
Amara has been a supportive force for me at Turing since before day one. Before starting she reached out to our slack channel to let us know that she was repeating the module, and that we could all reach out to her with any questions we had about Turing. I had the fortune of standing next to her on the first day, and immediately felt like I had someone who would support me through all of the newness around me. Amara encouraged me to be part of the Pahlka posse, has included me in creating a student group in Turing centered around diversity, and has helped me stop questioning whether I belong here. I am so grateful to have Amara has a cohort member, her welcoming me into the community helped shape my sense of belonging much quicker than I think it would have otherwise. I am so looking forward to continuing to get to know her and learn with her in future mods.

#### From Jason Conrad:
I am really impressed with the way that Amara stepped up and was a leader in her cohort this mod as a repeater. She truly lead by example every chance that she got. She was always asking questions and seeking out help. I really appreciated seeing her willingness to help others. Her bright personality was always a welcome sight and she was always willing to talk about anything, even if it had nothing to do with school. I not only consider Amara a good classmate but also a good friend. I can't wait to see all that she can accomplish at Turing!

### Playing a Part

This module I feel that I’ve been especially connected and involved in the Turing community.
First, I started creating a new posse (Hamilton) and helping organizing some activities like a session about Github with Caroline Powell, a visit to WeWork co-working space with a group of front and back-end students or an upcoming daytrip with a group of 20 Turing students in March to TechStars that is a prestigious incubator in Boulder. On the other hand, I actively participated in the channel Turing latino connecting with other members and trying to build community, events and projects to do together. In this same goal, I suggested to Daniel Rodriguez and Jonathan Serrano to have regular meetings with other latino people of Turing to get to know more each other and provide group support. That finally evolved to be an diversity and inclusive group to provide a space for everybody who felt part of a minority group or have special interest to talk about this topic. For this, we have created a channel called Turing Diversity and we will be meeting every other Thursday for lunch as an opportunity for people to share their stories and provide any support needed. We recently participated in Try Turing as part of the panel to show that Turing is a diverse crowd and as a way for us to connect with students part of underrepresented groups in tech in order to encourage them to join this sector. In addition to that we want to produce Turing podcasts in Spanish and other languages, write posts in Turing blog, organize a Diversity panel and maybe going to a school to do a code tasting experience and/or organizing a special session of Kids Who Code in Spanish for kids and moms. I also participated in the Turing hackathon at Blake in December and attended periodically to Productivity Lunch meetings. Regarding to participating in our cohort, I constantly offered my help to my classmates and sat with some of them to go over drills/exercises, answers questions about the program or Ruby related. I also shared with my cohort peers via Slack resources that I found especially useful to understand concepts as well as connecting them with great mentors like David Maurer or building the bridge between my cohort and mod2 people in terms of collaboration. I recentlly organized a groupal session to go over hashes and other topics that people were trouble with so they feel more prepared for the final eval and projects in general.
