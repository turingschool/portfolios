### Module 4 Portfolio

Areas of Emphasis
Over the course of my time at Turing, I have furthered my development in both academic and professional spheres.  
In terms of academic development, I enjoyed deepening my knowledge and understanding of both Ruby on Rails as well as Java Script. While both have presented challenges in their own regards, the intellectual stimulation that derives from working tirelessly until the problem is solved is beyond rewarding. Beyond an educational standpoint, I have enjoyed the relational aspect that Turing has offered, for I have found it very beneficial to develop relationships with my peers both inside the Turing doors and outside.
In regards to professional development, while I have been very impressed by the importance that the institution puts on job placement all the way from employing an on-site professional development specialist to incentivizing networking throughout the Denver community, I have been disappointed with the execution. I am afraid that we are beginning to see the market for developers in the Denver/Boulder area becoming oversaturated due to the exuberant number of boot camps in the area. While I feel confident that Turing will prepare me for success in both my professional and personal life, I am nervous entering into the workforce here in Denver. Though I have enjoyed spending my last 7 months learning more about Ruby and Javascript, as well as the wonderful people in the cohort, this next chapter I am sure will be filled with a variety of emotions, as I venture onto my own, individual journey.

## Group Work & Projects
Projects
We had two group projects during module 4: A) The Quantified Self and B) The Capstone project, Robot With An Attitude.
Quantified Self
Backend Github Link
Frontend Github Link
Frontend Production Link
Reflection Gist Link
Evaluation
Specification Adherence
3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect
2. Planning and Design
2: Team has some notes on how to implement their service, but someone else couldn't implement it.	
3. Testing
3: All back-end functionality is covered by tests. Front-end uses unit tests wherever logic can be separated from interface and network requests.
4. HTML/UI
2: HTML is greatly lacking in standards compliance. UI is confusing or very buggy.
5. JS syntax and Style
3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of some SOLID concepts. Attention payed to indentation and naming.
6. Git Workflow
3: Team is using the feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.
7. Project Management
3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized.
Capstone Project: Robot With An Attitude 
the-howler.herokuapp.com
This project analyzed the sentiment of speech. 
Evaluation:
1. Project Management
3: Team is using well formatted user stories and moving cards through each status in realtime
2. Completion & Pace
3: Team is able to set and update expectations so that there are no surprises on the last day of the sprint
3. Implementation Quality
3: Project exhibits maintainable well divided code. Developers are able to speak to architecture and implementation decisions.
4. Application of Techniques
3: Project has implemented one major technique that was new this week.
5. Documentation
3: Project features easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application
6. Accessibility
3: Team has implemented code to increase accessibility.
D: Professional Skills
The main goal for everyone is, I believe, to get us all jobs! The most valuable lesson for me was certainly the salary negotiation PD session, but I also loved the live technical interview that was conducted. 
Gear Ups
Mod 4 Leads Automation Gear-Up Planning Sessions
Original Assignment

Gear Up Reflections 
We brainstormed, designed, and led a gear up for the larger Turing community. Our group discussed the Black Mirror episode “Nose Dive” and the repercussions that social media, and our inherent obsession with it, can have on our view of self. We first demonstrated a clip of the video, and then set roughly 20-30 minutes aside for discussion. It was an interesting experience leading a gear up, as opposed to participating as a follower; however, I enjoyed bringing new perspectives to my fellow cohorts. Discussing the ways that social media has affected our lives, and the brilliance (or lack thereof) of a developer to create the ability for us to see likes, has drastically affected our vantage of reality, and getting the perspective of those around me was a truly fascinating experience.   
E. Community Participation
Being a Community Member
 
As a Posse leader this inning, It was a very “interesting” transition from the plebeian in the shadows to leading a posse. It was very difficult to balance the life of mod 3 projects and try and lead a posse. My main focus of the Turing lab was to actually have a realistic  “deliverable” that could be completed in the 6 hours we had to meet throughout the inning. I really enjoyed watching people come out of the woodwork due to passion. People that I might not have ever held a conversation with now are the future leaders of the T lab! I was lucky enough to witness several members spend part of their own coveted weekend to partake in the building of the cabinet for the arcade.
 
To conclude, Turing lab was a great way for those who wanted to express themselves creatively yet also offered respite from staring at the screen all day. I will admit that it proved a tad bit more difficult than I expected due to the amount of projects we had in mod3.
 
B. Playing a Part
 
Besides being a posse leader, I participated in every gear up, drug others to wrap up, including times when not a single staff member was present. A community is what you make of it, and I chose not to be a part of a weak one, but rather try at all times to build a bigger and stronger community that I would be proud to be apart of. 

## Blog Post fo Open Source

During module four, I took the advice of my instructors and looked through my favorite gems to find a flaw, which I could then fix. While I was looking at Pry, I noticed that they used HTML generator to style, and therefore, it was broken. I assessed the gem further, and after conducting lengthy markdown language research, I discovered which HTML elements worked in MD and which did not. I edited the readme and put up a PR, which was responded to the next day with a few minor requests. I responded to these requests by cleaning up my edit, recommitted my edits, and my PR was merged.   

During Bike Share, Andy and I worked tirelessly to get the gem, WillPaginate, to work with Sinatra. After researching the code for over 3 hours, we discovered that a helper module was missing, and therefore the gem was not functioning properly. I went to WillPaginate’s ReadMe, submitted that snippet, and within two hours it was merged to the Wiki with a thank you. By fixing the missing line of code, we were able to simultaneously fix everyone in the class’s WillPaginate.
