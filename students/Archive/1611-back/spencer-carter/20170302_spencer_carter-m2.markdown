## A: End of Module Assessment Status

(Please Indicate if Pass/Fail/Pending)


## B: Individual Work & Projects
This mod was a roller coaster of emotion on projects, some I am very proud of, others never were finished due to confusion or syntax errors. Coming into week 3 I felt I had no idea what I was doing, I was expecting to fail my mid mod, yet I passed. 
Bike-share and Little Shop went VERY well, I was a major contributor and was never scared to divide and conquer. Also Pairing with others and vbeing very successful! Another goal of mine is to be less bossy/ manage teammates. Both of these projects I did a very good job of keeping my mouth shut and helping the team be more positive and productive!


#### (Bike Share)

*   https://github.com/ande1618/bike_share

In this project, we utilized the data from the San Francisco bike share program to create a database for stations, trips, weather, etc. 

Functional Expectations
2: Application has some small missing base functionality
ActiveRecord

3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.
User Experience and Conventions

3: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.
Code Organization/Quality

3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/responses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views
Testing 

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests
Working Collaboratively 

3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool

### Gear Up
#### (Tragedy of the Commons)

I enjoyed learning more about the very real economic problem that is the “tragedy of the commons,” as I believe that we will see this become a more relevant issue in years to come. In our current ecosystem, particularly in America, I believe that this issue is frequently overlooked, largely due to the very stark reality that most Americans have never fretted over their next source of sustenance. Increasing longevity, innovation in biotech, slowing GDP, and economic uncertainty all may work interdependently to create a society in which overpopulation puts us in a supply vs. demand situation. It is rather ironic that as a result of the most innovation since the Industrial Revolution, we may in fact be forced to rely on our primal instincts for survival in the forthcoming years.

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)
Unfortunately, for many years we lived in a society where technical industries were dominated by men. I am happy to see that in the last decade this has started to see reform with initiatives such as Girls Who Code piercing all industries and increasing diversity in the workplace. 
In class, we were posed with two questions: 
1. How should a white male react to a scene in which a co worker walks into a room, only to see his cohorts watching a female colleague hula hoop dance? 
When this first question was first posed, I had difficulty even imagining such a situation, and further imagining the type of individual who could find this behavior acceptable. Coupled with my disgust of the male who would approve of this, is a sadness of the many females that likely felt that they had to essentially prostitute their bodies in order to be heard or command power in the work environment. 
First, I would try to intervene, and stop the situation. If that didn’t work, I would bring the managing director in, as well, to put his authority behind stopping the spectacle. 
How can a company keep this from happening?
A company can keep this from happening by manifesting a zero tolerance policy for discrimination in the workplace, and enforce it to the highest degree. In addition, companies should continue enacting initiatives such as Girls Who Code, which not only encourage diversity in the workplace but encourage females to enter into the industry from a young age via camps, internships, etc. I think it could be very beneficial for companies across a greater variety of industries to adopt similar initiatives. 


#### (Universal Basic Income)
This gear-up was focused on universal basic income. While I had heard about the concept previously, it really made me think further about a society in which all citizens would regularly receive a certain sum of money, either from the government or some other public entity. At the macroeconomic level, I liked that this could induce a better distribution of jobs, as people reducing their hours would increase the jobs opportunities for those currently excluded from the labor market. 


### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Session Name)
Collaborative Communication
1. We used Google Docs during Bike Share, though not quite as productively as we could have. Google Docs can be a very powerful tool; however, we did not utilize it correctly, and I think it was determined how badly we needed it, given the immense amount of data to keep track of. 
2. Being a student athlete during my undergraduate experience, I did not think that I needed to work on my abilities to effectively communicate in a team environment. However, I am happy that I learned from my cohorts that i could be more available on slack channels while working. I have the tendency to get so focused in the zone that my blinders, if you will, curb my attention away from notifications. Throughout the course of this module, however, I learned that while this may have worked in many other, less collaborative environments, had our team harnessed our communication skills, we could have increased our capabilities on the project.

Honesty
Tenacity
Be a leading dev in either my own company or a start up. (not down with the corporate vibe)
Travel to as many places as I can
Preferred places to live
Anywhere in Colorado, though ideally Denver or Boulder
Seattle, where my rad and chill gf lives ;)
Preferred salary and level of responsibility

I want to be given a great amount of responsibility, as I have learned that I learn best and challenge myself the most when I have a larger amount on the line 
After graduating from Turing, I would like to begin work at a company which will provide the opportunity for intellectual stimulation on a daily basis. I believe that this will come in the form of working for a corporation such as IBM, Apple, Microsoft, etc. which are constantly adapting their products to keep their edge against early stage companies. I plan to make this dream a reality by meeting with the Vice President of Product at one of the aforementioned incumbents. 

#### Blog post:
Artificial intelligence has recently infiltrated the biological sphere. Aiming to complement genomic data with other biologically-relevant data,
we have recently seen a variety of technological developments focused on developing and applying large scale computing and machine learning (artificial intelligence) to make novel discoveries to revolutionize the practice of medicine. By using artificial intelligence to cross reference a patient’s microgenomial structure with massive amounts of clinical data and 1000’s of individual cases,
by harnessing this technology, we hold the potential to one day predict medical conditions in the future based on genetic code.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

James,
Thank you for being one of the members of the "DreamTeam" for Bikeshare! Working with you did not even feel like work, more simply getting tasks done and moving on. I want to commend you for the growth I have seen since we first talked in Mod1. You were an all-star in the group not only with coding, but also with your level headedness at all times! Your biggest area of growth would be communication within a pairing. I could see the Eureka happen in your head, but wouldn't always get an explanation of what/why. I understand not wanting to lose that thought and needing to get it typed out ASAP, but a brief explanation of how that idea came to fruition while you type could help your partner out. I will try to emulate your work style from here on out, as you knew when to grind, and when to rest. You were a phenomenal teammate and I look forward to working with you again! 

Wooten-clan!
I want to thank you for being the fearless leader of the "DreamTeam" for Bikeshare! I was excited to work with you, and you did not disappoint. Not only are you becoming an exceptional developer but the way in which you approached problems was true "growth mindset." There never was there an ounce of doubt from you, it was merely a matter of when it would be solved. The area that you should focus on is grit, in a "the enemy of good, is better" type of way. ( I was right next to you for this part, I need to work on it too) Pretty much the "code freeze" that Carmer discussed with us, would have benefited our health and our presentation. You had an extra layer of responsibility being our "project manager," you did an excellent job not being bossy or letting the power go to your head. We heard cohort mates talk about how our group envied. This is largely due to you and your efforts as Project Manager. Andy I enjoyed working with you and cannot wait for the opportunity to work together again!  

Jonathan, 
It was an absolute pleasure working with you on Bikeshare! Your knowledge, plus your communication while pairing made for the easiest, most efficient "driver/navigator" experience yet.
I also commend you on the effort you made on testing! Although you were awesome in parings, I think you could still grow just a bit more in communicating with the group. Not knowing if you were struggling with an issue or just crushing tests (t'was the latter) had us overlap work once. You were the silent assassin, and I was envious of your knowledge on every aspect of the project, you could CRUD, test, html, and brainstorm with the best of them! Keep up the hard work because it is clearly paying off! 

### Being a Community Member
#### Andy Wooden: 
Spencer, it was an absolute pleasure to get to work with you.  Your drive and enthusiasm are tremendously refreshing and kept me going on some of the longer days.  You did an awesome job in throttling back your tendency to lead but remained an invaluable asset to our group.  In the future, I think it would benefit you to recognize you’re struggling and reach out for help more quickly rather than keep on trying to push through solo; it’s an area I struggle in also, but it’s alright to ask for help. I had a great time working with you, and it was great to pair up with you on the problems that we did.  I think working with you helped me grab onto a few ideas more easily than I would have otherwise.  I look forward to working with you again in the future.

#### James Anderson: 
Spencer, working with you has been a trip. I think you were successful in your goal of stepping back from a leadership role. You paired with everyone on different tasks and from my point of view, were very easy to work with. You were communicative while you were navigating and made sure to share ample time on the keyboard. In the future, I'd like to see you come in with more confidence in your ability. Do not let the transition from M1 to M2 faze you, you are a competent programmer. I also think it would have been beneficial to practice a code freeze once the project was within a 10 hour window. I think we all meshed really well and I'm very proud of the headway the four of us made in skill level and the work we produced. Looking forward to the next time we get paired together.

#### Jonathon Serrano:
Spencer, watching your grit and determination all throughout the project  was inspiring. You definitely put in a lot of hard work in all bases of the project, testing, database migrations, table creations, etc. What I saw was that you didn't give up, if you didn't understand how or why something wasn't working or had no clue about it you set out to get answers. While I admire this trait, It did lead you into trouble at times. An example, when creating a test for a trips feature you delved into the realm of creating the perfect test, making sure every single spot was touched. You explored areas that are brand new to us and this caused you to lose a lot of time that could have been spent on another task. Remember agile workflow, get something working then you can go back and add more to it. I would like to see you stay focused and not trying to be perfect right off the bat, it will save you countless hours on future projects. Thanks for being a helpful, well-rounded and informative partner.
