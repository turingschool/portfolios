Areas of Emphasis

Entering into module 3, I was a little intimidated, as I had heard from my cohorts in the module(s) ahead that it was handedly the most difficult to complete. With this in mind, I focused on keeping up with the class, and aimed to achieve the best grades possible. In terms of academic development, I feel that my knowledge and understanding of Ruby on Rails developed substantially throughout the course of the module, as I continue to find the language both challenging and intellectually stimulating. In addition, the relational focus at Turing benefited my learning immensely, as I discovered that I often have the highest retention when I am either reinforcing my understanding via teaching a cohort, or observing/learning from my cohorts. As a result, I believe that the number of group projects over the course of the module accelerated my educational advancement.

B: Individual Work & Projects

This is a summation of my individual projects for Module 3

Tank Manager 

GitHub URL
Original Assignment

Description of Project 

An application which enables users to monitor all aspects of their
fish tank from a remote location. To provide our users with accurate information, we
gathered a number of variables beforehand, such as the individual user’s water
parameters, fish type(s), date of purchase, etc. Since our users are away from their
tank, and thereby likely away from their house, we added a feature which allows
the user to receive information about nearby stores which sell products for fish
tanks. This allows the user to immediately grab an item to restore the
pH balance of their fish tank, in the case of a rapid change during the course of the
Day. Similarly to Yelp, the user can then review and/or comment on the credibility of
vendors to inform others of discounts, inventory, or diseases deriving from a
particular vendor.  

Problem
Maintaining a healthy environment for user’s tank and fish while keeping track of local shops that he or she frequents.
Solution
Allow user to monitor all water parameters throughout time so he or she can identify trends in certain parameter spikes.
Allow user to view stores near him or her and comment about store quality, sales and other pertinent information.
See a map and get directions to the store of user’s choice. 
Diagnose fish tank problems.(i.e. “What do I do if I have ick?”)
Target Audience
Aquarium owners beginner to advanced, ages 10-45
Integrations
API: Google Maps &
OAuth: Facebook & Gmail

C: Group Work & Projects

Kickstarter

Github Link
Original Assignment 
Description of Project 
Kickstarter sites enable people to back companies and/or projects with tangible rewards in exchange for a percentage of ownership. This model traces its roots to subscription model of arts patronage, where artists would go directly to their audiences to fund their work. We recreated this by utilizing Ruby on Rails.

D: Professional Skills

Gear Ups

Grit
GitHub URL

Grit is the combination of perseverance and passion for long-term goals. Grit entails working strenuously toward challenges, maintaining effort and interest despite failure, adversity, and plateaus in progress. An individual with this characteristic approaches achievement as a marathon, and his or her advantage is stamina; while disappointment, boredom, or burnout signals to others that it is time to change trajectory. The embodiment of grit is essential to development at Turing, as we must push ourselves to the limits, and even when tired, stay on course. While this determination may cause many to experience exhaustion and sleep deprivation in the short term, those that lack this quality will not be gifted with success in the longer scheme. 

Automation
GitHub URL

Less than 50 years ago, union laborers began losing their jobs to machines, as corporate executives began discovering the faster pace at which machines could produce a higher volume workload, while simultaneously cutting costs and shedding legal liabilities. For instance, the steel industry shed 75% of its union workforce between 1962 and 2005, as automation enhanced productivity.

However, as innovation has continued to progress, machines are now coming in the form of highly intelligent robots, leaving humans in the trenches, facing robust competition for jobs. As we saw in the past, some labor-intensive industries, such as oil and mining, may feel this come into effect more rapidly as executives avoid labor-related injuries and lawsuits; however, this trend will likely impact the marketplace through every industrial facet. Even sales-based professions, typically thought to be reserved for outgoing, exuberant humans, may feel pressure as robots save immense amounts of corporate cash by always upselling, never taking vacation time, and the like.

Over the next few years, I expect that we will see means put into place to ease the transition for workers whose jobs have been displaced by robots. These could include retraining programs, stronger unions, a bigger earned-income tax credit and, for the next generation of workers, increased educational advancement.


E: Feedback and Community Participation 

Giving Feedback

To Eric Wahlgren: “Eric was a pleasure to work with. He has a deep understanding of everything we have learned so far and was always willing to lend a hand. He was a major force in our team, and took the time to explain things to me when I was having trouble. His dedication to making our project great was unmatched, however, I felt that it was sometimes to his own demise. His willingness to pull long hours alone, but sometimes this would be problematic to catch the team up on what he did that night. I believe that this desire to forge ahead derives largely from his deep knowledge, and passion for, of the field. Overall, I'm completely grateful for his commitment to defining and sticking to a clean and efficient workflow process, as it definitely elevated our project to the next level. He was an integral part of the team, and I look forward to working with him again in the future.”

To Charlotte Moore: “Charlotte, has the dedication coupled with the willingness to stretch her abilities makes you an extremely valuable team member and a pleasure to work with. She served as project manager and I truly believe that she drove everyone in our team to do the best work that we could do while contributing huge amounts of work herself. She was willing to help any way that she could to drive each member of the group to success. My only concern for Charlotte is driven by two of her strongest qualities: drive and dedication. I believe that her willingness to pull long hours comes from a love of the work, however, over time this can become grueling. Particularly if she continues to take on the majority of work in team settings, as each group member should contribute meaningfully, relieving her of some of the weight she shoulders for the betterment of the team. Charlotte, you are truly an incredible programmer, and I have no doubt in my mind that you will be extremely successful, but don’t overwork yourself on the way there! Try and smile once ;)”

To Edilene Cruz: “G is a dedicated and enthusiastic team member. She takes her role as a group member seriously, and her extremely cheerful, optimistic spirit inspires those around her. During my time working with her, it was made evident that she deeply cares about the experience of every member in the group, which contributed heavily to the solid foundation that made our group so successful. I only hope that G can have the same confidence in her coding abilities as she does in her persona, as she is both quick-witted and a quick learner. However, that being said, she never fails to ask questions when she is not confident in a topic, and truly listens to and learns from your answer. All in all, G, you bring a huge amount of positive energy to any team, amazing brain power, and I look forward to working with you again.”


Being a Community Member

As a Posse leader this inning, It was a very “interesting” transition from the plebeian in the shadows to leading a posse. It was very difficult to balance the life of mod 3 projects and try and lead a posse. My main focus of the Turing lab was to actually have a realistic  “deliverable” that could be completed in the 6 hours we had to meet throughout the inning. I really enjoyed watching people come out of the woodwork due to passion. People that I might not have ever held a conversation with now are the future leaders of the T lab! I was lucky enough to witness several members spend part of their own coveted weekend to partake in th building of the cabinet for the arcade.
To conclude, Turing lab was a great  way for those who wanted to express themselves creatively yet also offered respite from staring at the screen all day. I will admit that it proved a tad bit more difficult than I expected due to the amount of projects we had in mod3.

Playing a Part

Besides being a posse leader, I participated in every gear up, drug others to wrap up, including times when not a single staff member wa present. A community is what you make of it, and i chose not to be a part of a weak one, but rather try at all times to build a bigger and stronger community that I would be proud to be apart of.
