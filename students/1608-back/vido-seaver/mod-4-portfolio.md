# Vido - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did I set out to accomplish this mod? Great question, as always I wanted to survive. I wanted to get good at javascript. I really wanted JS to be my focus for the mod. While I'm certainly better at it I than I was and I finally understand jquery I'm not where I was hoping to be. I'd say i've most improved at fringe things. I did a ton of pairing with mod-1 students which I really enjoyed. I got much better at devops-ish stuff (deploying to heroku, trouble shooting etc). I lead a spike on workflow shortcuts and your development eviorment which was a ton a fun and I think really helpful to those who attended. And I survived. Barely.

## Rubric

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* 3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 4. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.

### 5. User Interface

* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality

### 6. Documentation

* 3: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the application

### 7. Workflow

* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## C: Group Work & Projects
#### Quantified Self

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alishersadikov/quantified-self)
*   [Original Assignment]()

I Enjoyed the hell out of Quantified-self. It was mod one all over again just grinding on code for 12 hours a day. I learn really well in that envoirnment and wished the tone of the mod had stayed like that. I was paired with Alisher which was great. I really enjoy working with him. Like I said we just put in long hours and both felt really good about the work we turned in.

Assessed By: Nate


You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

Functional Expectations


3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect

2: More functionality implemented than tested or only uses one test type

4: Team used CSS preprocessor and put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes for DOM traversal, and data namespace attributes


2: Javascript is noticeably lacking in the above concepts.

3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature

Project Management

3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized. Nearly every card has been turned into user stories.

##### Feedback to Alisher:
Alisher, I really enjoyed pairing with you on Quantified self. It was on of my top three groups while at touring.  Your a hardworker, smart and are great at putting your head down and putting in the work. I also like how we could annoyed with each other and then it would be history and not matter the next day. That ability to move on is not something everyone posses. I don’t really know what to say as far as how you can improve. Maybe being comfortable with the final product? Or not <-redacted-> as much when we are in a small space? I don't know man, I enjoyed working with you. It was great.


##### Feedback from Alisher:
"Vido is a hardworking developer with good team spirit. We had a lot fun with him building the Quantified Self app. One striking thing about him that I do not see often among Turing students is enjoying the learning and problem solving sides of programming instead of treating it like a chore. On the constructive side, he already knows what he needs to fix!"




#### Mentorship

* [Production Site](https://turing-mentorship-prod.herokuapp.com/)

*   [Backend Github](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/MentorSHIP)

MentorSHIP was our "brownfield" capstone project, i'd say it went alright. I don't think the project maximized my learning and  like the rest of the mod I feel like i learned more auxillary stuff and less coding. What I'm trying to say is i think had the project been different or the group had I been different might have been able to level up my coding skills as well.

Members: MentorShip Team

Reviewer: Nate

Notes:

1. Project Management

4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily.

2. Completion & Pace

3: Team completed all stories scheduled for this checkpoint by the product owner.

3. Implementation Quality

4. Application of Techniques


3: Project has implemented one major technique from the previous two weeks of academic classes.

5. Documentation

3: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the application

#### Feedback to me
##### Ben:
This was the first project I worked on with Vido. His ability to understand a problem and tackle it is wonderful. He has an ability to look at a problem and see a solution. Several times we paired trying to figure out what the next step was and Vido was able to articulate the solution and navigate through all the issues.

Vido, I know it can be frustrating taking steps back in a project. Its shitty to re-do something several times and have to wait for other things to complete. Its part of the job. Getting stressed hurts you and your team. Try to take a step back and just roll with the punches when they come. You know what you're doing and can accomplish a lot. Just control what you can and let the other things fall by the way side.

##### Jon:
Vido it was cool working with during mod4. We hit a few struggles but we were always able to work through them and I really appretiate the positive supportive attitude you bring in times of stress and how you check in and support other members of the mod.  Your abillity to think through problems and spot potential problems and to come up with ideas and solutions are huge assets to any team you are apart of.  I think at times you could prioritize functionality over clean code when there is a time crunch, but it is definitly a balancing act.  Thanks for all the time together at Turing!

##### Megan:
#### Feedback from me:
##### To Ben:

Ben you're strong developer. You picks your cards and get it done. I’m shocked that you are being told to retake the final. It makes me think the whole thing is predetermined. You’re also great at giving feedback and you get the shit done you say he will. Your energy is a little frenetic  and I think you'd do well to slow down a little. I didn’t get to pair with you that much but when we did you were sharp, quick and on point.  I got a little frustrated with you in regards to the database design but that is water under bridge and you handled that quite well. I had a good time working with you and would gladly do it again.

##### To Jon:
Jon I’ve worked with you on several projects at turing. Its always been a good experience. You have great interpersonal insights and are always very aware. I think these skills will take you far. Its cool to see how much better you’ve gotten since rush hour in early mod 2.  I really enjoyed the deeper conversation we had the other day about antagonism and the way people respond to communication. You have a lot of wisdom and a lot to teach. Thanks for being such a good teamate. To the point of quality code vs time i think in the future if you have a gut feeling about where something should live. Just ask. That way if others make the decision with you they are equally responsible. Again I enjoyed working with you and look forward to seeing what you accomplish.

##### To Megan:
This was my first project working with you megan and you were a great team mate. You are level headed and stay steady. Get work done and carry your weight. You also do an excellent job of keeping an eye on the end goal and keeping the group pointed in that direction. I’m sorry about the way I handled my frustration with jon and you last week. I really wish I hadn’t lost my cool. My frustration was more with jon and you kind of got just caught in the crossfire. You were a solid teammate I don’t really have any complaints.


## D: Professional Skills
#### Overcoming Imposter Syndome
The only time I've felt imposter syndrome was at about two in the afternoon during the final assessment. I was seriously questioning my development skills and felt entirely overwhelmed. I was panicing. I couldn't focus. I couldn't think about what the next step was but i forced my self to just take one. Then another and I worked through it. I'm not scared of the job search or of interviewing or personal outreach.


### Gear Up
####  [Tragedy Of the Commons - Diversity](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Bias exists naturally bias leads to more bias.
How does one balance or counter act this trend?
Equal funding - will it change anything.
Education is the only option so it doesn't feel forced -  but its slow.

#### [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

Automation is a terrifying yet very real prospect. On the one hand I think humans are incredibly survivors yet on the other I think we are building magic more strong and heartless than we are. Will the bots have compassion? Will their compassion for a species of primate more evil, self absorbed and cruel than any other being on earth be those that for their compassion for the entire planet? I doupt it. I think we're pretty well fucked. I don't know if having kids is a great idea.

#### [Basic Income](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

Basic income is an interesting idea. Hopefully we don't have to face it too soon. I hear the arguments for both sides. I'm not sure I agree with either. Yes I think the impoverished's quality living needs to improve. But what about factory workers in Polinesia or the 20 million  slums of Mumbai? We talk about privilege in america and the disparity of it. What about the privilege of being american? But back to basic income. I think the bigger issue is if you take away the need to work to survive atleast in some capacity you take away some of the meaning of life. Not to mention important lessons and personal growth.


### PROtocol
#### Spike Session

*   [Spike Markdown](https://gist.github.com/vidoseaver/54ccf4940dbfebb9d2c9e1a5cc5a6946)

I lead a spike configuring your machine with Ben and Matt as co-leads. We basically just went over shortcuts, bash profile settings, hotkeys and snippets. There were close to fourty people in the classroom and gave me a feel for how hard it is to teach. Especially to gain interaction from your audenience. They laugh when you least expect it and planned jokes fall flat. It had alot of fun and it was pretty exhilerating and now a fair amount of mod one have activate power mode.


#### Pairings

I had six pairings with mod 1 students this mod and I had one 5 hours pairing with a friend in SF

### Being a Community Member


Hey Vido, thank you again so much for teaching me about modules and for pairing with me on the file io stuff. I understand it all so much better now. We just got assessed on our project and scored high on our TDD effort and file io setup – I owe you one!

### Playing a Part

I lead a spike and had 7 pairing sessions with mod one students. Pairing was probably the most enjoyable part of turing for me this mod other then quantified-self.
