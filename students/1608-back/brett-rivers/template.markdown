## B: Individual Work & Projects

This is a brief overview of my individual projects.

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/riverswb/sorting_suit)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/67df787e17e66bb446af2e10c4c6e72b3d41579b/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

Sorting Suit is an introduction to common sorting algorithms utilized in computer science.


#### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/riverswb/date_night)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

Date Night is an introduction to binary search trees and how they can be utilized to connect large sets of data.


#### Assessed By: Beth Sebian

#### Notes:
* Repo here: https://github.com/riverswb/date_night
* Missing `load` and `health` base methods
* Testing sufficient, would like to see more unit and edge-case tests
* `Insert` implemented using recursion, while `sort`, `min`, `max` implemented with hash holding data
* Overall strong start: in spite of completion shortcomings, the project demonstrates some comfort with Ruby principles and tactics.


##### 1. Functional Expectations
* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

##### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

##### 5. Looping *or* Recursion
* 2: Application has issues with loop/recursion techniques or mixes them inappropriately

#### Event Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/riverswb/event_reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

Event reporter is a project that utilizes a REPL to interact with the program and the [Sunlight Foundation's](http://sunlightfoundation.com/) API to look up information about congressional districts.

Assessed By: Jeff

Notes:

* Overview: think I squeaked by with everything working, HTML works but garbage
* REPL functionality works well with all features
* HTML functionality is there but needs better formatting
* Just one file of a couple tests
* Implementation is in a few big piles
* For next project, focus on components and testing as two sides of the same coin

##### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

##### 2. REPL Interface

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

##### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

##### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

##### 5. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### 6. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

##### 7. HTML and Style

* 3: HTML is valid and has all correct data.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

An overview of my group work.


#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JStans12/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)


The purpose of complete me is to build an autocomplete system with a trie data structure. A trie consists of nodes which know the location of their children, but not their parents. Nodes are unaware of the key with which they are associated. Keys are defined entirely by the node's location in the trie. In our case, the only bit of information that a node stores aside from it's children, is a boolean to describe whether or not it is a word.

Notes:
* Completed base expectations and extension: Shoes
* TDD functional, focuses mostly on high-level tests that verify methods do-all-the-things. Opportunities exist to test supporting methods. Overall, solid.
* Encapsulation: methods managing multiple levels of responsibility, need to extract execution of distinct tasks into concise, explicitly-named methods, opportunities to improve naming overall to aid readability
* Style often solid, but with some inconsistencies: double negatives (!= nil?) and "if nil?" instead of unless. Opportunities to create more clear parallelism in code.
* Execution of project didn't require many enumerables. Some sounds use, some missing opportunities to consolidate tasks (ex: sanitizing letters)


##### 1. Functional Expectations
* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

##### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

##### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods



#### Head Count

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jdconrad89/head_count)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

Head Count is a project that uses available government data to analyze relationships between economic status, kindergarten participation, and high school graduation.

Notes:
* Spec harness passes through iteration 2
* Some test coverage, but inconsistent
* Need to extract from large methods and test

##### 1. Functional Expectations
* 1: Application crashes during normal usage

##### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

#### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

##### 6. Code Sanitation
* 1: More than ten complaints


## D: Professional Skills
My proffesional development over module 1

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

Everyone has a different learning process and getting to understand mine is important so that I can be an effective and efficient learner.  It is important to understand how emotional states effect my learning process.  Knowing my learning process and understanding how my emotional state effects it will help me be an efficient learner at Turing.  



#### There is an "I" in Team
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

This Gear Up helped me understand the importance of DTR at the beginning and also at a later point in the project.  By having a thorough DTR we can make sure that all team members are valued and comfortable.  

#### CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

I did not attend this Gear Up, I was not feeling well so I went home.  My restorative justice steps to make up to the community is to straighten up in the morning for the first three days of the next module.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p1.md)
* [Link to Linkdin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riverswb)
* [Link to Twitter](https://twitter.com/riverswb1)
* [Link to Github](https://github.com/riverswb)

In software development personal branding in the digital world is of the upmost
importance.  Since this workshop I have created a twitter account and I have
updated my LinkedIn profile.  I will continue to personalize these tools to
help me further my career in software development.

DTR from Head Count:
DTR Memo
Project:Head_Count
Group Member Names: Jason Conrad & Brett Rivers

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project? Goals and expectations:

Jason - To get better at both TDD and use/understanding of git workflow get better at implementation

Brett -  TDD implementation and github

Schedule Expectations: When are we available to work together and individually?

Jason - On days that I have to go back to Castle Rock preferably leave school before 9 otherwise if I am staying in Denver I can stay as late as needed.

Brett - Living in Ft Collins prefers to work from home via slack, screener etc. Can’t stay at the school beyond 6 o'clock.

Communication Expectations: How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?

When we finish working on something posting an update up on our slack channel. Touch base verbally once a day just to keep on track and stay on the same page.

Abilities Expectations: Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement:
See Project Expectations

Workload Expectations: What features do we each want to work on?

Will Revisit after looking at the Spec
Workflow Expectations: Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests:

anytime you create or remove a feature you should be pushing to Git. name the branch that you are working on with your initials and what it is that you are working on.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: Feedback should be given in some form during each touchable.

Agenda to discuss project launch:

Spend time reading over and taking notes on the rubric and spec and then discuss what we see and what we have taken away as expectations.

Ideas:
 Will revisit when we discuss the specs
 
Tools:
Slack, Screenhero, google hangout etc.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Jason is a great member of the community; always in a good mood, ready to listen to a problem,or tell a joke. His presence improves my Turing experience

Dan is a great community leader as half of 1608-BEs SAB, he is easily approachable to discuss issues regarding the module and
it is apparent he cares about the module.  He is also an excellent community member and cares about discussing individual's personal issues.



### Being a Community Member

Dan Olsen: Brett was an awesome addition to the team. He is very knowledgeable in many areas and is eager to share what he has learned. This outgoing personality allowed us to collaborate and assert our learning with each other all throughout the mod. He has a great sense of humor that definitly helped during those tough times. Brett is a welcomed addition to any team!

Jason Conrad: As for community, Brett would always make me feel included in conversations that he was in. He was also willing to help with issues earlier in the module when we weren’t working together.

### Playing a Part

I volunteered at Try Turing Fort Collins and I make the first pot of coffee
every morning.
