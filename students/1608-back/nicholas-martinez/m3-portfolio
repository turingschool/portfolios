# Nicholas Martinez - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal throughout the module has been to work through the material with a focus on Development Operations and deployment. I have spent a significant amount of time working with AWS, Capistrano and Chef. During our Cloney Island project, I was able to deploy our app out to an AWS EC2 instance with S3 storage and built in download and upload functionality into the our Drop Box clone.

## Rubric Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 2
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Student: Nick

Assessor: Lauren

Notes:

Consuming:
- API key is hard-coded
- SearchController is making two calls to StoreService, which thusly becomes 2 api calls. In the future, try thinking of a way to get total stores as well as the list of stores in one api call.
- Hashes are still in the view, but I can see efforts moving towards getting rid of that in StoreService/Store model
- Feature spec could be stronger to test against all content types coming back from API (or this could be done at unit level)

Providing:
- Status code for delete not coming in (`render status: 204`)
- Internal API is very well tested

## Evaluation Criteria

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### 1. Ruby Style

* **3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components**

### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 3. Testing

* **3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.**

### 4. Progression/Completion

* **3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.**

### 5. Workflow

* **4: Developer commits every 15 minutes**

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This section of the portfolio will outline the Individual projects that were completed throughout the module. The first individual project for the module was API Curious and the final individual project was my personal project. Outlines and links to the code for both can be found below.

#### (API Curious)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NZenitram/api_curious)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module3/projects/apicurious.md)

In this project, I focused on consuming and working with data from Reddit's API.

(Project was not evaluated)

#### (SpamGrid)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NZenitram/spamgrid)

For the personal project this module I set out to build a web application that sends 'spam' email. The goal of this project was to build an app that allowed a user to upload a list of email addresses, select an email template, and send mass emails to their victims while circumventing the anti-spam features use by SendGrid.

When a user clicks 'send spam' the application is able to spin up an EC2 instance on AWS, deploy the application, send the emails and shut the server down. This give each new iteration of email sent a fresh IP.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### (Rails Engine)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NZenitram/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

In Rails Engine we used Ruby on Rails and Active Record to build a JSON API to expose a data schema. We used a namespaced, versioned API to serve the information and used advanced Active Record queries to perform more complicated business intelligence.

Evaluator: Lauren

Students: Jon and Nick

Notes:

README should include db setup instructions.
Code is pushed through layers of Rails really well.
Routes have room to refactor out hardcoded dynamic segments (:id)
Code coverage is high, but some core layers could be more thoroughly tested / code that isn't used could be removed
Boss level challenge not implemented
Merchant unit level specs would be nice
Project Rubric

1. Completion

3: Project completes most requirements but fails 3 (5 for individual project) or fewer spec harness tests.

1. Test-Driven Development

4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

2. Code Quality

3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

3. API Design

4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

4. Queries

4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

From Jon Kimble:

  - Nick you were a great partner to have on rales engine.  You showed up early, worked hard, and kept a consistently positive attitude as we worked our way through difficult problems.  I think the one area where where you shine the most is your empathy for others. You are clearly aware of others thoughts and feelings, and go out of your way to check in on others and make sure they are doing well.  This is a great trait to have as both a team mate and a human being! If I had to give one piece of advice it would be to slow down, especially in the beginning, and evaluate what to skim-over/time-box and what to spend a little more time on.  I think if we had spent a little more time in the beginning understanding test set up and some active record basics it would have accelerated our progress overall.  It was great working with you and I hope we have a chance to work together again in the future!

#### (Stuff Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JStans12/stuff_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module3/projects/cloney_island.md)

Notes:

Missing "guests can view public content"
Admin account is misnamed
Don't have a user profile view, or any slugified URLs. Need to check with Lauren to make sure this was approved.
Using AWS to offset missing some client expectations.
- Routes file was their example of some bad code

Client Expectations

Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.

2: Below expectations

User Experience

Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

3: As expected

Organization

Team used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

3: As expected

Technical Evaluation

Git Workflow

Team always used pull requests and commented on pull requests prior to introducing code into the master branch.

3: As expected

Test Quality

Project is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?

3: As expected

Code Quality

Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.

3: As expected

Bonus

We want to recognize and reward risk-taking and exploration. Sometimes other areas might suffer if the risk doesn't pan out. Earn a bonus point to offset a score above.

Did the team push themselves by taking risks?

1: Yes

From Joey Stansfield:

- Nick, it was good working with you on cloney island. I know you were a little concerned that the dev ops stuff was kind of optional and you spent most your time on it, but to me, it doesn’t really matter what you’re working on as long as your working hard and excited about it. I’m glad you got the chance to dive down that rabbit hole and I’m happy to have been a part of it. I think a possible area of improvement for you is git work flow. There where a few cases of disappearing and mystery code throughout our project and those could probably be eliminated pretty easily. I think the specific deployment branches made it especially difficult and I’m sure you’ve already figured out how to be a little cleaner in this area. Overall good stuff. Would have lost my mind on that project without you.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### (Micro-Aggressions)

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group2.md)

The articles that discussed the topic suggested that the term is used to typically describe an 'offense' that was taken out of context or misconstrued. The checklist that accompanied the articles, I believe, mixed blatant racism with what it called 'micro-aggressions' to conflate the two and make mundane comments seem more powerful than they actually are. If we as human beings take the default position that the person speaking with us does not mean offense by the statements that are similar to those listed in the gear-up, all of society will be better off.

#### (Journey Mapping)

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

Journey mapping is an effective way to work through a user experience. Asking questions about the paths people have taken to get where they are, and more specifically the problems they encountered along the way is an excellent strategy for coming up with solutions to issues we as developers may be blind to. As developers it is easy to get into a frame of mind that the applications we are building are easy to use and hassle free. It isn't until we actively seek the opinions of those that use them that we can fully understand some of the more nuanced complexities of the UX experience.

#### (Grit)

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

Grit is a characteristic that is displayed through hard work and effort. Grit is developed through failure. It comes from the idea that success is determined not necessarily by talent or skill, but by work. Someone who is gritty doesn't quit in the face of adversity or conflict but rather pushes harder.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Joey Stansfield -

- What can I say Joey, you just get it. Your ability to work your way through a challenging group environment and build out software is remarkable. Working with you was a pleasure. I appreciate your willingness to let me branch out on the project and focus on Dev Ops. I wish I had mode more time to work more closely with you on the code base because it would have provided me the opportunity to learn something from the stop student in our class. Your honesty and condor in explaining they way you felt with one our group members in particular is admirable. Thank you for all of your hard work and diligent work ethic. I hope I have the opportunity to work with you again.

Jon Kimble -

- Working with you on rails_engine was a pleasure. You are understanding disposition makes you easy to work with. Your ability to adapt to the personality of the person you are working side by side with will be invaluable in the work place and throughout your career. We were setting new industry standards every step of the way! Outside of that project, you are in general, a very genuine and modest man. You set the bar very high in the way you communicate with and represent our cohort. You are a model student and representative of the Turing community. I can only hope to have the opportunity to work with you again.

David Junta:

- David is an excellent work partner and provides consistent feed back. Our work together was productive and efficient. David is great at bouncing ideas around and working toward a common goal. David is a great communicator and very professional. He managed the stress of a very difficult project well and was a blast to work with. I would enjoy working with David on projects in the future.

From David Junta:

  - Nick was a fantastic project partner for our Cloney Island project.  He took on an ambitious task of building and deploying an AWS server for the project and did so very successfully.  He was great about giving us summaries of what he learned throughout the process to give us an idea of the roadblocks he hit and how he overcame them.  I also appreciated that he checked in with the rest of the team frequently to make sure we didn’t need his help on the rest of the project.  Nick is a total team player and great addition to any team.


### Playing a Part

This module I played a role within the cohort through assisting and teaching people about deploying their web applications into production environments. I learned a lot about the asset pipeline and issues associated with the production environment that I was able to share that knowledge with people throughout the cohort and play a role in their development and understanding of the differences between the local development environment and production deployment.
