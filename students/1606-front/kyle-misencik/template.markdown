# Kyle Misencik - (M1)-FE Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
I wanted to start off strong and gain a solid foundation for moving forward into the
next modules. Honestly, considering Turing's reputation, I just wanted to move on to module 2.
I also consider this my first steps into a new career which I wish to be successful at.


### Game Time

Functional: 3
UI: 3 - 'fixed directions'
Testing: 2
JS Style: 3
Workflow: 3

### Work

The following is a list of projects assigned during mod 1.

#### Personal Portfolio

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kylem038/portfolio)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/portfolio-first-draft.html)

A portfolio site represents you, your personal brand, and is a fantastic opportunity to make a great first impression. For this project, we’ll be focusing on how you structure both your content and your HTML & CSS.

#### Color Changer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kylem038/color-changer-solo)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/color-changer.html)

The application will have the following:
A default window background color of white
Two buttons
One that sets a random background color that cannot be white
One that resets the background color to white

## Team

### Projects

A summary for the team projects during mod 1 - FE.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kylem038/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Build a game where the user picks a number between 1 and 100.

Functional: 4
JS Style: 3

Felt good after this one. Potentially go back and practice refactoring.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kylem038/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

In it’s simplest form, the application should have the following:
Two input fields
One for the title of the bookmark
One for the URL that the bookmark should link to
One for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page
A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display:
The title of the bookmark
The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL)
A button to “Mark as Read”
A button to “Remove” the bookmark

Functional: 4
JS Style: 2.5
Workflow: 4
HTML: 3
CSS: 3

Redid this solo over a free weekend and was pleased.

#### ideabox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kylem038/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

For this project, we’ll be increasingly thinking about the “server” and “client” as separate entities. We’ll be using:
JavaScript (with jQuery) to manage client-side interactions.
JSON and localStorage to persist data between sessions.
Your entire application will consist of one HTML page or template.

Spec Adherence: 3
User Interface: 4
JS: 3.5
Workflow: 4

Come back to this and practice localStorage!

### Giving Feedback

Blake Worsley - Hey Blake - here is my feedback for linked list —— Really enjoyed working with you on this project. From beginning to end we both worked hard to not only deliver a great final product but to learn along the way. I don’t feel like we strayed at all from our DTR. Additionally, I feel like linked list was the project where we struggled through Git & Github and came out making great strides in our understanding of how to use it. I did notice that after trying something only a few times you’d get pretty agitated & stressed that it wasn’t working. I think keeping a level head & being aware of when a big problem needs to be broken down into smaller ones will pay large dividends for you over your career as a developer. Looking forward to working with you again!

Casey Cross - Hey Casey - here is my feedback for ideabox — — Really enjoyed working with you on this project! Our communication was great and I don’t believe we strayed from our DTR one bit. I know we both leveraged mentors & peers a lot for this project, but in the end we learned a ton and the fact that we got 3’s & 4’s speaks volumes. I know at crunch time we both got a bit stressed and there was some fist pounding and swearing going on. I think moving forward keeping a level head in those situations will allow you (and me) to keep a clear head a recognize we need to break a larger problem into a bunch of smaller ones. Looking forward to working with you again!

Casey Metz - Hey Casey - here’s my feedback for number guesser --- Really enjoyed working with you on my first project at Turing. I think we were both figuring out Git & Github, but ended up with a great final version on our Github. Functionally, the number guesser turned out exactly how we liked. One thing we both stressed during DTR was learning as much as we could, and I do feel there were times where we came in after a night of work and you had completed a lot. I think moving forward making sure to communicate your rationale and methods for getting things to work will make the teams you’re in that much more cohesive. Definitely looking forward to working with you again!

Mike Sausa - Hey Mike - here’s my feedback for gametime ——— Enjoyed working on this challenging project with you. I think your perseverance will allow us to present a fully functional game tomorrow. I learned a lot from your approach to logically breaking down problems and your understanding of JS syntax. Also, your instinct to burn our code and approach it from a different perspective will stick with me moving forward at Turing. It was also great to see you progress in your confidence with Git & Github. I did notice that you don’t really use Atom shortcuts at all and sometimes you were unsure where you were in your Terminal. Moving forward I think practicing Atom shortcuts & setting up Bash aliases will make you way more efficient as a developer. Additionally, I think we both can use some more practice with JS testing. Looking forward to working with you again!

Blake Worsley - Had a great time working with you on linked list. We had a great opportunity to work through a difficult project together. We successfully delivered a final project and learned how to navigate git well in the process. The only critique I would give is that at times I would have liked to have a bit more control over what was happening. In the future I think taking turns switching who controls the flow when pairing will be beneficial. Thanks again though for everything and I look forward to working with you soon!

Casey Cross - Kyle, you were a great partner, you gave me some great advice about not letting yourself get stuck on one problem for a great length of time without reaching out for help.  Idea Box was a more challenging project than I think either one of us anticipated and yes, it gave us some of our first “Turing moments” but just knowing we were both feeling the same things (as were many of our classmates)  helped us get through.  In the end, we produced a great project that I am proud to put both of our names on.

Casey Metz - Hey Kyle, here’s mine - Kyle was a great first project partner. On Number Guesser he went out of his way to lead the DTR. As he mentioned in my feedback, I was a bit eager on this first project, and sometimes raced ahead without clear task delegation. Kyle communicated this in a respectful way, and we were able to re-set our expectations before the end of the project. By the end, we were doing a better job of sharing driving and tasks, and Kyle kicked butt on styling our site. He has a great work ethic and knows how to seek the help and resources necessary to complete difficult tasks. Looking forward to working together again!

Mike Sausa - Working with Kyle was hugely beneficial for me. For the past two weeks Kyle has been my GitHub sensei pulling me up from zero to near-hero, and I can’t thank him enough. Kyle is really good at taking the reigns and getting the ball rolling on things, and is an excellent communicator and collaborator. He has an excellent workflow and was great at creating tasks and keeping our waffle.io up to date. One of our weaknesses was our lack of poor testing - definitely something we can improve upon in the future. Ultimately I think we were on the same page for the whole project (even if we were in a rabbit hole for a bit) and really enjoyed working with Kyle. Hope to do it again in the near future!

### Playing a Part

Admittedly I didn't participate in many things outside of class & our Friday community time. I'd definitely like
to start a posse next module to help support the next group of FE students coming in. I know the backend already has
a posse like this. Hopefully, as I become more confident in my efficiency and time management skills, I can begin to
focus more on networking and attending after school events.
