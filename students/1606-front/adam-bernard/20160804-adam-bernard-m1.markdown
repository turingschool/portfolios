### Areas of Emphasis

I set out to be able to make a basic website, while diving deeper into HTML and CSS and starting to learn Javascript.  I have an interest in coding and also wanted to increase my skills at a faster pace than I could teach myself. I found css really interesting and wanted to push myself in it.

### End of Module Assessment

I learned a lot about CSS and HTML5 over the course and had no idea how important Javascript was to designing for the web.  At the end of this module I feel like I learned a lot about how to manipulate the DOM with Javascript although I do still need to focus on syntax more now, so I can use this knowledge to my advantage.  Overall I do believe that I received good scores all around as all scores, but one were 3 or higher.  The only score under a 3 was in linked-list were Pete and I had one function that was longer.

### Work

We only had one solo project over the entire module which was color changer.

#### Color Changer

* https://github.com/ab255/color-changer
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/color-changer.html

Color Changer was an application that if you pressed a button would randomly change the color of the background of the page to a different color.  There was also a button that would set the color back to white.  I did have a problem with the buttons having rounded sides in safari and was unable to find a solution until after the project was due.

In Functionality and HTML i received a 4 and in JS style, Workflow and CSS I received a 3.

## Team

### Projects

Over the course of module 1 we had four team projects and I had three different partners through them.

#### Number Guesser

* https://github.com/swanie21/number-guesser
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

An application that picked a random number between 1-100 or a user set range and the user would be able to guess it.  I worked with Kirsten on the project and it went smoothly and we were able to complete all phases.  We had a few stumbles throughout the project, but overall we tried out new things and researched things we didn't know to make sure that we were working towards the end goal.  We had some issues with design but otherwise all functionality was working and learned a lot about how to research and debug our code.

For the first project our evaluations went well and we did get some great feedback about refactor our Javascript and how that for our first project our Javascript did look good.

Functional: 4
JS Style: 3


#### Linked-List

* https://github.com/Peter-Springer/bookmarker
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

Pete and I created a website that took URLs and title and created a dynamic element of them for future reference. Overall the project went smoothly and I learned a lot from Pete on this project.  He made sure that we took the project step by step with functionality and in return completed the whole project.  Learning JQuery on this project seemed to help a lot and made it seem easier to write the code.

Had one long function that could be refactored.

Functional: 4
JS Style: 2.5
Workflow: 3
HTML: 3
CSS: 3


#### Idea Box

* https://github.com/ab255/idea-fiesta
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

I worked with Ben on this project and we defenently struggled to get this project going and using local storage, but one we figured this out, we flew the remainder of the process. We ended up approaching the entire project differently then most other teams, but felt that overall it ended well.

Our Javascript was well written and our CSS seemed to be responsive although it stretched to far out for the iPhone 5.  Overall though it was working properly and storing in Local Storage correctly.

Spec Adherence: 3
User Interface: 3
JS: 3
Workflow: 4


#### Game Time Jr.

* https://github.com/Peter-Springer/game-time
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html

Worked on a Breakout style game with Pete.  With had some trouble with collision detection while making the game, but really tried to utilize tests to check that everything worked and ended up solving our problems.  Overall we did a lot of experimenting to make sure everything worked well and the game turned out fun to play.

Make sure we are more consistent with semi-colons.  

Functional Expectations: 3
User Interface: 3
Testing: 3
JS Style: 3
Workflow: 3

### Giving Feedback

To Kirsten:   
For Number Guesser we worked well together and I was glad that we talked about how we worked ahead of the project, so that we knew what to expect. I thought it was great that you took charge with the formation of the base game while I was looking into the later phases. I actually think we both did well with github considering we didn’t know about branches yet.  If we had an opportunity, we definitely could have spend more time on it’s appearance, but with the time making functionality work was still spent well. Another opportunity you had was making sure you aren’t afraid to speak up more.  You had some great ideas that I felt were awesome and with more confidence in these decisions you could have a lot of impact on the final project.  Otherwise It was a great experience working together and I think we  meshed well and really focused on getting the project fully completed.

To Pete:  
For both linked-list and game-time, I believe that we had a great partnership.  I think I learned a lot from you in linked-list and it rolled over to game-time, about taking each step at a time and not rushing the project.  Both projects have gone smoothly although we did get stuck in a few places during Game-Time.  As for an opportunity I would say to speak what you are thinking more, while you work out logic in your head.  Both projects went great and I do believe we worked well together.

To Ben:  
I think overall we worked well together although we did have our struggles at the beginning of the project, we pulled it out by the time it was due.  As for an opportunity, I would say that you shouldn’t second guess yourself and try things and don’t worry if they fail the first time.  You had some great ideas that worked out really well. I know it came down to the wire to finish the project, but it turned out great and you did an amazing job at refactoring the code.

### Being a Community Member

From Kirsten:   
For our first module project I think we did a fine job! I think we could have worked on the styling more, but we were more focused on completing the functionality. I apologize for implementing the bright retro colors. Great recommendation with including the instructions. Since the game became more complicated with the user inputting their own range the instructions were a good idea. Also in relation to the range increasing, nice work in finding out how to increase the range with discovering how to use ‘min’ and ‘max’  variables. Since this was our first rodeo with using Github I think we learned the rhythm of committing, but we should have been making branches and then merging onto the master. Overall, we had great teamwork for the first project.

From Pete:  
Adam and I worked together on two projects this module. Working on game time with Adam was great. His strong math skills were a real asset that allowed us to work at a steady pace. An opportunity for Adam would be to work on breaking problems into smaller components. I think this would benefit himself as well as any of his future teammates. I found Adam to be a very strong problem solver but occasionally felt that we were trying to tackle too much at once. Overall I think we worked well together and was happy with the outcome of our projects.

From Ben:
I really enjoyed working with Adam. He had a great vision of where we needed to go with the project, and was very determined in making sure we had approached a problem from every angle before we got frustrated. Even when we’d get stuck on a problem for an entire class, Adam was very persistent in trying to find the issue, which made our dynamic work very well.

If there was anything that I’d say you could work on, it would just be to focus in on one small problem at a time. You were great at analyzing where we needed to go and what the project would look like overall, but sometimes we would both get caught up in looking at the entire project, rather than moving along with the smallest possible part. Once you get this down then you’ll be killing it!

### Notes
Didn’t have any expectations, so was open to seeing what would happen. Had no idea what we were going to be doing. Javascript has been a cool exciting thing to get into.

Had hopes and dreams to b more involved in community things, but it has been a little tricky. Not sure how to dive in, wants to be more involved next module.

### Outcome
PASS
