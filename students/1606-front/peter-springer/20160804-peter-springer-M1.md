# M1 Front-end Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to learn the fundamentals of front end
engineering. Specifically in reference to javascript, HTML,
and CSS. I also wanted to work
on algorithmic thinking as a whole.

### Projects

Listed below are all my projects and scores
from this module.

#### Number Guesser

Partner: Paul Nguyen

* <a href="https://07nguyenpaul.github.io/number-guesser/">Number Guesser</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/Peter-Springer/number-guesser">Number Guesser Repo</a>
* <a href="http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html">Number Guesser Spec</a>

Number guesser is an application that allows a user
to guess a random number between 1-100. If the user
guesses incorrectly they will be prompted with a hint
of higher or lower. When the user guesses correctly the
range will both increase and decrease by 10.

#### "Linked"-list

Partner: Adam Bernard

* <a href="https://peter-springer.github.io/bookmarker/">Bookmarker</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/Peter-Springer/bookmarker">Bookmarker Repo</a>
* <a href="http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html">Linked-List Spec</a>

This project is an application for keeping
track of your bookmarks. The user submits a
title and url which is then rendered to the DOM
using jquery.

Evaluation scores:
* Functional: 4
* JS Style: 2.5
* Workflow: 3
* HTML: 3
* CSS: 3

#### Color-changer

* <a href"https://peter-springer.github.io/color_changer_solo/">Color Changer</a>
* <a href"https://github.com/Peter-Springer/color_changer_solo">Color Changer Repo</a>
* <a href="http://frontend.turing.io/projects/color-changer.html">Color Changer Spec</a>

Color-changer was a one day solo project involving
two buttons. One button generated a random color as
the background of your page and the other button resets
the page to white. Part of the spec for this project was
to make sure that the page was mobile-responsive.

#### IdeaBox

Partner: Blake Worsley

* <a href="https://blakeworsley.github.io/ideabox/">Ideabox</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/Peter-Springer/ideabox">Ideabox Repo</a>
* <a href="http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html">Ideabox Spec</a>

IdeaBox is an application that you can use to
keep track of your ideas. The user submits a title
and idea that is then rendered to the DOM. This project
required us to utilize local storage allowing ideas to be
saved in between sessions on which ever device you use.

Evaluation scores:

* Spec Adherence: 3
* User Interface: 3
* JS Style: 3
* Workflow: 4

#### Game-Time

Partner: Adam Bernard

* <a href="http://peter-springer.github.io/game-time">Game Time</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/Peter-Springer/game-time">Game Time Repo</a>
* <a href="http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html">Game Time Spec</a>

For game time my partner and I decided to
build breakout. Breakout is a game where you bounce a
ball off a paddle and try to break any bricks that are
present on the canvas. I found this to be the most difficult
project of the module.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback to Blake:
Blake and I worked together on ideabox. The project was a success and I feel that we were able to collaborate very effectively. At times throughout the project Blake seemed highly stressed. I think this may have been from not fully understanding some syntax(for loops?). I think as Blake gets more comfortable using documentation the unknown will become less stressful and possibly even a little fun.

#### Feedback to Adam:
Adam and I worked together on two projects this module. Working on game time with Adam was great. His strong math skills were a real asset that allowed us to work at a steady pace. An opportunity for Adam would be to work on breaking problems into smaller components. I think this would benefit himself as well as any of his future teammates. I found Adam to be a very strong problem solver but occasionally felt that we were trying to tackle too much at once. Overall I think we worked well together and was happy with the outcome of our projects.

#### Feedback to Paul:
Paul and I worked together on number guesser. I found Paul to be easy to work with. He was able to navigate problems in an effective manner. We both seemed to get a little hung up on syntax but I think that is expected on our first project. I would be happy to work with Paul again in the future.

### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback from Paul:
Pete and I worked together to create our first project in Turing. We created a number guesser game. Pete was great partner with teaching his understanding of github. We found multiple bugs in our code and his problem solving skills are amazing. I would definitely recommend Pete as a partner and I would gladly work with him again on future projects.

#### Feedback from Blake:
Pete and I ended up with a solid ideabox concept when we presented. Pete was very good about taking the time to explain concepts he had undertaken and completed and was willing to do whatever it took to output an excellent finished project. I do think we both came into the project with ambitions to learn above all else and I feel like we had conflicting ideology of what to do next at different points throughout the project. Looking back, I think if we created a more concrete plan of how we wanted to proceed through some of the complicated parts of the project, we would have been able to collaborate more effectively during pairing sessions. Otherwise Pete was great to work with and I am glad I had him on this project.

#### Feedback from Adam:
For both linked-list and game-time, I believe that we had a great partnership.  I think I learned a lot from you in linked-list and it rolled over to game-time, about taking each step at a time and not rushing the project.  Both projects have gone smoothly although we did get stuck in a few places during Game-Time.  As for an opportunity I would say to speak what you are thinking more, while you work out logic in your head.  Both projects went great and I do believe we worked well together.

### Playing a Part

I supported the larger Turing community this
module by helping set up the new Champa space
when volunteers were needed and in my free time.
I also started an Accessibility posse that is admittedly
off to a bit of a slow start but we plan to ramp up
engagement in mod two.

## Review

### Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Community Participation**: 3
* **E: Peer & Instructor Feedback**: 3

### Notes

- Significant role in helping with things around Champa
- Here are my terrible notes:
solid start and finish
feels good about how things went
steve: in top half of class, feels good
better experience as a whole
started solid stayed solid

Struggled in the backend program, but feels like this has been a much better experience all around. Feels good about things went.

From staff: we really appreciate how engaged you are, and how you are willing to jump in and help. He gives great feedback to us about things the students need from us ro things that arenâ€™t working well or need adjusting.

### Outcome

PASS
