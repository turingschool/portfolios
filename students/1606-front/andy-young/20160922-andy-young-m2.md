3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.


#### User Interface

2 - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.

#### HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.  

#### CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

#### JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


#### Testing  

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.

#### Workflow  

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation  

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

3 - Five or fewer complaints

#### Design

2 - Layout, content hierarchy, typography, and color choices show effort, but the result is not effective. The evaluator recommends significant changes.

#### Feedback from Ben Godfrey:

> Andy was awesome to work with the first time, and equally as awesome to work with the second time. He let me drive for long periods of time, which was a great experience because I felt like I was lacking in skill coming into this mod. He was great at giving and taking feedback, and offered a lot of interesting ideas on how we could go about making and designing the app. He also came up with a super cool ‘bot’ response functionality for this. Andy is an insanely hard worker, even when he doesn’t understand things, he tries to catch up and understand them and could usually end up explaining the concepts better than me (regardless of who wrote the code). Lastly, I would venture to say that Andy has the highest EQ in our entire class. He’s alway so caring and thoughtful with any actions he’s taking, and that made it a joy to work with him for three weeks straight. Andy is definitely the homie.

> For Andy, the biggest thing I would say you could work on is the way you approach problems. From all the time I’ve spent working with you, your knowledge of things is not even remotely an issue, but the way you approach problems could stand to change. As soon as you start approaching problems with an “I’m going to crush this, even if I don’t fully get it yet” attitude, you’re going to have some INCREDIBLE growth as a developer. I genuinely cannot wait to see you hit that next level.

#### Feedback to Ben:
> Ben is the Ambassador of Awesome! Let’s get real. I love Ben. He truly cares about his colleagues. He has a diplomatic style that’s enviable.
I’ve witnessed him working with vexatious persons, under tight dead-lines, and still keep his cool while crushing project milestones.
He has been the voice of reason for me on more than one occasion. He’s not timid in handing out the unvarnished truth. For some this is difficult, yet Ben seems to handle difficult situations with his own brand of finesse. He has my vote for SAB, and when he gets in, his ideas and voice will shape Turing for the better.

Evaluator(s): Brenna & Bree

Group:  Jeff & Andy

Brenna's Notes:
  >Really great use of modular functions and breaking out functionality into tiny components. Opportunities to refactor large files, but arguments against why they chose not to speak to design decisions.

  >Missing the visual cue for when the timer is almost up, but will refactor and finish by end of day for a 4.

  >Strong implementation of TDD and attempts at integration testing.

#### Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface  

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

#### CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.


#### JavaScript Style

4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

#### Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.

#### Workflow

4 - Zero complaints

#### Design

3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

#### Feedback from Jeff Duke:

> Andy, it was really good working with you on our project.  Though we definitely had some challenges, I think we worked well together and I’m happy with how the project turned out overall.  Thanks for the walks and good talks!  My  only actionable feedback for you is to keep working on those fundamentals and to make sure you speak up if you feel like you’re not understanding things.  Look forward to working with you in the future!

#### Feedback to Jeff Duke:

> Jeff is the paragon of cool. He's a pro. Under tight deadlines, and piles of work, he stays centered and focused. He has a perspicacious eye for detail. It's quite enviable and indeed encouraging to work with Jeff because he reveals insights and crafty ways to model a problem. Jeff's a fine teacher in this way, because while working with him you get to see into the mind of a problem solver, and thusly, shape your own style & technique. It's no surprise that Jeff is an experienced communicator.  He is the only one to actively use the DTR. I found this profoundly helpful, because it sets the stage for how the team will work moving forward.
To wrap-up my time with Jeff, I would say that he truly cares about what's important for me. He's empathetic to the stresses of Turing and eager to help and support his colleagues in any capacity. Jeff is already a fine friend and poised to be a coveted developer.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Debugging the Gender Gap: CODE documentary

I realized that I contribute wittingly and unwittingly to a culture of contempt. Just being aware is not enough. I will work harder to help women and minorities take greater agency of their lives in this field. I can start by listening more and offering my time to help pass on the modest knowledge I have of human affairs.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback
To Kristen Burgess:
>I've worked with Kristen several times over the module and am impressed with her acumen and drive.
I've watched her attack problems in creative ways while pivoting to new strategies should an impasse loom.
She's cheerful and compassionate. A few times I've shared some difficult feelings and she was patient and attentive.
Kristen is, on her own merit, the arbiter of her future. And the grace with which she balances life's undulating challenges remains an art of itself.


To Kris Foss:
> I feel at ease while working with Kris. She cares deeply about learning and creating a safe space for me to grow. At no time did I feel rushed or of inconvenience when I needed extra time to learn. In fact, her centered disposition has given me a model to emulate, especially when I would quake over a daunting task. Often her cool approach served as a guide for how I could negotiate a solution. I admire how she comports herself with the quiet calm of a professional yet is not afraid to 'parachute-in' and help fix elusive bugs.  I'll miss Kris, she always makes me smile.


### Being a Community Member

From Kristen Burgess:
> Andy has been such an amazing resource for me throughout  my first module, both academically and emotionally. He has a particular knack for taking difficult problems, breaking them down, and attacking them with an approach that is straightforward and easy to follow. Even on his busiest days, Andy somehow can always find a moment to selflessly help another student. Whether this help is pairing through fixing a bug or going for a walk to release some stress, he is always ready to offer his support with a smile. I have personally experienced his unparalleled kindness and exceptional insight, as well as seen others graced by the same; there is no doubt that Andy Young is an invaluable and irreplaceable asset to the Turing community.

From Nick Chambers:
> Andy was consistently available on the pairing schedule and seemed to always be offering his time to either pair on projects or chat about the Turing experience. No matter what the situation, I welcomed his perspective on tackling difficult problems. Every time I paired with Andy or even just spent a few minutes looking at a line of code, I would learn something useful or generate new momentum towards solving the problem at hand. He brings a great energy to the Turing community, and it's awesome to have a guy like him around. Thanks for the help this mod, Andy!

### Playing a Part

Where I could, I helped my colleagues better use and understand their terminal and IDE.
