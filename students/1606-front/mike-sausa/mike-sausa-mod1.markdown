### Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

* Become proficient in Javascript, HTML, and CSS to build a strong foundation
  for the coming knowledge and prepare me for a career in the field.
* Learn to break down problems into their smallest components and improve
  upon my logic and reasoning skills to think like a programmer
* Be able to collaborate and communicate effectively with my peers on joint Projects
* Get involved with the community and attend events within the industry outside of school

### End of Module Assessment

### Work

Throughout the first module, I completed 6 total projects including my portfolio, as seen below.

#### Portfolio

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sikemausa/Portfolio)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/portfolio-first-draft.html)

This was our first project after an introduction to HTML, and CSS. We were to create a personal portfolio to display the projects we would make, as well as provide our information and social media. There were many design aspects to this project, and responsiveness was also a requirement.


#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sikemausa/number_guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

In this project, we built a number guessing game where the user submits input and gets feedback as to whether their guess was too low or too high.
This being our first project, we struggled to implement all of the features. This can be attributed to
adjusting to the pace of the class, and I improved on all subsequent projects. Number guesser was a good
introduction to programming logic and breaking problems down into their smallest parts, and despite not
being as successful as I would have hoped (we were unable to implement increasing the max, decreasing the man after winning, and setting the range), the project was a great learning experience.

### Projects

These were my projects for mod 1 front end.

#### (Linked List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sikemausa/crispy-broccolist-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This project was our introduction to jQuery, where we build a list of websites with names, and allowed for them to be deleted and marked and unmarked as read. This project went far better than the first, and I felt like I began to get a decent grasp of Javascript syntax.

#### (Color Changer Solo)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sikemausa/color-changer)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/color-changer.html)

This project was our first solo project. We built a page that had a random button which would set the background of the page to a random color, as well as a reset button which reset the background to white. This project was fairly simple after having become well acquainted with jQuery, I also very much liked working solo for a change.

#### (Idea Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sikemausa/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This project was intense. We created a page with inputs for ideas with their name, body, and quality (all of which needed to be editable). We then stored each idea in localStorage and called it back to be rendered upon loading the page. This was an excellent intro to Object Oriented Javascript and localStorage.

#### (Gametime - Snake)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sikemausa/game-time-starter-kit)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This project is a culmination of what we've done this module. We used HTML5 canvas to draw our game,
added some interactivity with jquery, styled with CSS, and used javascript to add interactivity.

### Giving Feedback

Andy -  Andy’s parent’s should have named him Mandy, because he is the man! His communication is excellent and I felt like we were always on the same page. We struggled through some features, but I think this was due to getting adjusted to the pace of the course. One of the things I loved about Andy was all of the workflow advice and tools he helped me discover, it helped me a great deal and I am still using many of them! Our project was an overall great experience.

David - Hey David - great working with you, it was clear you knew your stuff, and your communication was spot on. I definitely agree that we could have utilized our time to push the envelope, and I feel that our workflow (github) could have been better. Other than that, everything was awesome!

Paul - Paul was great to work with, he was awesome at taking initiative and getting features started, and was very effective in knowing when we were stuck an asking for help. Our workflow and GitHub had some room for improvement, but overall Paul was great to work with, and pushed us through some tough stretches.

Kyle - Working with Kyle was hugely beneficial for me. For the past two weeks Kyle has been my GitHub sensei pulling me up from zero to near-hero, and I can’t thank him enough. Kyle is really good at taking the reigns and getting the boll rolling on things, and is an excellent communicator and collaborator. He has an excellent workflow and was great at creating tasks and keeping our waffle.io up to date. One of our weaknesses was our lack of and poor testing - definitely something we can improve upon in the future. Ultimately I think we were on the same page for the whole project (even if we were in a rabbit hole for a bit) and really enjoyed working with Kyle. Hope to do it again in the near future!

### Being a Community Member

From Andy - I liked working with Mike because he takes the time to listen. And it’s no surprise that he’s good at teaching! When I was confused, or unsure of what to do, Mike could ask a thoughtful question and help me get back on track. I give much credit for his determination. There were several times when I was tired or frustrated and his good nature and levity eased me down and helped focus ​_my_​ efforts.
Mike knew how to multiply our team’s energy as well how walk away before we burned out. His ability to balance the needs of the project among our many other obligations made the completion of our project possible as well as fun.

From David -  really enjoyed working with you.  From an interaction standpoint I feel like we were consistently on the same page, communicating through issues, and focusing on what matters.  As far as what we could improve, we could have focused our excess time on pushing the envelope more so than we did(but that would have sacrificed the finer design elements we nailed)

From Paul - Mike and I worked together to create our Idea Box program. Mike was able to navigate problems in an effective manner. The only problems we had was with github. My only suggestion is to keep working with it because github has several tricks to work efficiently. I would happily work with Mike on future projects.

From Kyle - Enjoyed working on this challenging project with you. I think your perseverance will allow us to present a fully functional game tomorrow. I learned a lot from your approach to logically breaking down problems and your understanding of JS syntax. Also, your instinct to burn our code and approach it from a different perspective will stick with me moving forward at Turing. It was also great to see you progress in your confidence with Git & Github. I did notice that you don’t really use Atom shortcuts at all and sometimes you were unsure where you were in your Terminal. Moving forward I think practicing Atom shortcuts & setting up Bash aliases will make you way more efficient as a developer. Additionally, I think we both can use some more practice with JS testing. Looking forward to working with you again!

### Notes

Wanted to improve HTML and CSS foundation, hadn’t done any JS so wanted to learn more. and get better with HTML and CSS. Wanted to learn how to break problems into smaller pieces to tackle.

Hasn’t collaborated in the this type of setting before so wanted to learn about that and how to get better at that, and wants to get more involved with the community.

Surprises: the pace was surprising, was much faster than expected, took a while to adjust to that and feel comfortable with it

Had been commuting from Lyons, first part of the  module, is staying with family in devner now so it’s been much better without the commute now.

Feels like he’s a little slower picking things up, break week is a great time to review and study and rebuild a few things.

Wants to focus on and get better at TDD

Feels very positive about all the pairs he was on, learned from all the people he was paired with, had very positive experiences and appreciated having the team work and the learning opportunities.

Staff: Mike is always positive, glass-half-full. He sees the best in his team mates and his work, and we’re glad he’s here.

### Outcome

PASS
