# Casey Cross - M1 Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

In module one, I wanted to learn as much as I could about JavaScript and jQuery.  I also wanted to become comfortable using a Mac as I had been a PC user prior to Turing. In addition, I wanted to become proficient at using Atom, GitHub, and learning command key shortcuts for all of the above. I also wanted to become a productive part of the Turing community and start building lasting connections and relationships with my fellow students and instructors.

### End of Module Assessment

* Progression/Completion: 3
* JavaScript Style: 3

* Collaboration: 4

### Work

These are the projects I completed independently during this module.

#### Personal Portfolio Website

* https://github.com/kccrs/Portfolio
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/portfolio-first-draft.html

This is the first draft of my personal portfolio website.  It uses HTML5 and CSS3 to style and add content to the site.  This website will be a work in progress as I continue my Turing journey.  I intend to beautify this project and add some interactive JavaScript elements as well as some more advanced CSS features such as animation.

###### Evaluation Comments

During check-ins on my portfolio earlier in the module, Louisa recommended I revisit my color scheme choices as the colors I had originally chosen didn't work together as well as I had hoped.  She also emphasized to me that this is going to be a work in progress throughout our Turing experience so not to stress about it not being exactly what we would like it to be right now.

###### Evaluation Scores

#### Color Changer

* https://github.com/kccrs/color-changer
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/color-changer.html

I really enjoyed this project.  It simple, yet dynamic and fun.  I also enjoyed that it was the first project we got to complete on our own.  In this project there were two buttons... one button to chose a random background color that could not be white and another button to reset the color back to the default. We also had a style spec to model.

## Team

Teamwork makes the dream work.

### Projects

We had four paired projects this module.

#### Number Guesser

* https://github.com/kccrs/number-guesser-1
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

This was our first project of module one.  I worked with Brett Hevia to build an interactive game using JavaScript.  In this game, the user defines a minimum and a maximum guess range. Next, the computer creates a random number and the user tries to guess that number.  The computer gives feedback to the user to help them narrow down their guesses and then increments the game to a larger range on the next round.  We used HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript on this project.

###### Evaluation Comments from Steve Kinney

We definitely had some areas where we could refactor our JavaScript and use fewer global variables.  Our GitHub workflow could have improved.

###### Evaluation Scores
* Functional Expectations - 4
* Fundamental JavaScript Style - 2.5


##### Feedback to Me from Brett Hevia

I worked with Casey on the first project of the module. Even though neither of us had any idea what we were doing when it came to Git (or anything, really), I never felt uncomfortable or worried about making mistakes because of how open and supportive Casey was. We were both able and willing to laugh at ourselves and recognize our shortcoming which made it easy to communicate and encouraged us to try stuff without fear of disapproval or letting each other down. I’d happily work with Casey again anytime.

#### Linked List

* https://github.com/kccrs/linky-list
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

In this project, Ben and I had to create a website where the user could input websites they wanted to bookmark as well as a short description of those sites and display them on the page.  The user could then mark a list item as read and the website would keep track of how many total links were on the page as well as how many links were read or unread.  The user can also remove items from the page if they so choose.  We used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery on this project.

###### Evaluation Comments from Steve Kinney

We completely forgot to add clickable links to our project, which Steve pointed out to us.  Also our JavaScript and jQuery could use some refactoring.


###### Evaluation Scores

##### Feedback to Me from Ben Godfrey

#### IdeaBox

* https://github.com/kylem038/ideabox
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

IdeaBox was a challenging project.  It was the first time we were introduced to localStorage.  The project concept is a web page that can store your ideas in chronological order. You can then rate your ideas on a three point scale from 'swill' to 'genius'.  The ideas would then persist in localStorage in that browser.  The user could also search for a specific idea or delete an idea they no longer wanted. We were given a layout comp to match with CSS styling.  For this project we used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON, and localStorage.

###### Evaluation Comments from Steve Kinney

We received excellent scores for our GitHub workflow and user interface. Steve was impressed that our search input was case insensitive.

###### Evaluation Scores
* Specification Adherence - 3
* User Interface - 4
* JavaScript Style - 3.5
* Workflow - 4

##### Feedback to Me from Kyle Misencik

Really enjoyed working with you on this project! Our communication was great and I don’t believe we strayed from our DTR one bit. I know we both leveraged mentors & peers a lot for this project, but in the end we learned a ton and the fact that we got 3’s & 4’s speaks volumes. I know at crunch time we both got a bit stressed and there was some fist pounding and swearing going on. I think moving forward keeping a level head in those situations will allow you (and me) to keep a clear head a recognize we need to break a larger problem into a bunch of smaller ones. Looking forward to working with you again!

#### Game Time

* https://github.com/kccrs/Snakes
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html

In this project we had to design a game using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.  Paul and I chose to make the classic snake game, but with a fun "Snakes on a Plane" theme.  This was a very challenging project but we learned a great deal. For this project we used HTML5, HTML5 Canvas, CSS3, JavaScript, and unit testing.

##### Evaluation Comments from Louisa Barrett

We should make the canvas background image blurrier/more opaque to reduce distractions as it is a somewhat busy image.  We should also use a different font as handwriting fonts are kind of atrocious.  We could do more refactoring of our JavaScript code. Overall our project was super fun.

###### Evaluation Scores

##### Feedback to Me from Paul Nguyen

Casey and I worked together to create our first game, SNAKE ON A PLANE! :snake::airplane: She taught me more things about github that I did not know. She has a great work ethic and organizes her work well by creating multiple branches on github. Casey has a great eye at spotting errors and resolving them in an effective manner. We worked efficiently together and I am proud of what we created. I can’t wait to see what we create next in the near future!


## Community

### Giving Feedback

#### Number Guesser - partner Brett Hevia

 I worked with Brett on the first project of module 1.  We were both very green in our workflow as is expected early in module 1.  I found him easy to collaborate with and our skills complemented each other well.   I think we both learned a lot from each other.  I would happily work with Brett again in the future.  Also, he is a fellow Gator which earns him extra bonus points.

#### Linked List - partner Ben Godfrey

 I worked with Ben on the Linked List project.  I found him easy to collaborate with and our skills complemented each other well.   He does not give up in the face of frustration as we both had issues getting CSS to behave properly but he persevered.  I would happily work with Ben again in the future.

#### Idea Box - partner Kyle Misencik

Kyle, you were a great partner, you gave me some great advice about not letting yourself get stuck on one problem for a great length of time without reaching out for help.  Idea Box was a more challenging project than I think either one of us anticipated and yes, it gave us some of our first “Turing moments” but just knowing we were both feeling the same things (as were many of our classmates)  helped us get through.  In the end, we produced a great project that I am proud to put both of our names on.

#### Game Time - partner Paul Nguyen

Paul makes an excellent teammate. I worked with him on creating a snake game for the Game Time project.  He has a very serene and pleasant demeanor, even when he is incredibly frustrated.  Thus he served as a calming influence for me during my times of frustration.  I think our skills and strengths complement each other very well.  We also had a great balance in sharing the workload.  My only advice would be for Paul to take more Pomodoro breaks to clear his head when stuck on a problem for a length of time.  I would happily pair with Paul again in the future!

### Being a Community Member/Playing a Part

Throughout this module, I took many opportunities to be a supportive and contributing member of the Turing community.  I was nominated by my instructors to serve on Student Advisory Board, which I found to be a valuable experience for three reasons.  First, I got to meet and interact more with students from the back-end cohorts and gain a better understanding of their experiences. Secondly, it made me instantly feel like a valuable part of the Turing community.  Lastly, I found it very insightful attending staff retro meetings and I got to actually learn most of the names of the staff members that front end doesn't typically interact with.

Additionally, I participated in several lunch roulettes and was able to interact with back end students though Gear Up and Student Led Sessions.  I also attended Imposters' lunch and have participated in equity discussions in the Joan Clarke Society Slack channel.  

As far as the greater Denver tech community goes, I attended an event featuring an insightful movie about the gender gap in tech. I also
attended several Girl Develop It MeetUps.
