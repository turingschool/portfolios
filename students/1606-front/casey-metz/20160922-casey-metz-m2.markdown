# Casey Metz - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I felt some good momentum coming out of mod1, and wanted to try to add on some extras this mod by taking on more leadership in Pahlka and by getting involved with tutoring 1608. I feel like I've accomplished these things without letting my own academics slip too much. I didn't really have too many areas of focus though, specifically. I'll try to come up with some for next mod (setting up some social media branding and job materials would be a good one, and learning my tools and shortcuts better would be another).

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 4 (I think)
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 2.5 (I was not good about getting Louisa's design challenges done)
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3 (They're all still a bit buggy)
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3?
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

It looks like only Brenna's evaluees have their scores posted to the repo, and I failed to write mine down mid-assessment. Brittany evaluated me, and I got some combo of 3s and 4s. Her main comments were: 1) don't break things out too much until there's a use case for doing so, 2) keep code human readable, even if it means being a little bit more verbose, 3) my workflow and speed were good--it wasn't painful to watch me code.

edit: They were posted an hour ago. Here they are:

_Casey Metz Instructor: Brittany Notes: Worked quickly and seamlessly between tools, was able to read, understand and solve errors quickly._

_Small feedback around JavaScript style and keeping code clean and readable; mostly stylistic things rather than functional feedback._

Progression/Completion: 3
JavaScript Style: 3

Collaboration: 3

## B: Individual Work & Projects

  We didn't have any graded individual projects this mod besides out mid-mod number guesser project, and that's not on the list of things that go in this portfolio.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The four major group projects I completed this module were 1) Holla!, The Lonely Chatroom, 2) a pomodoro app, 3) BeerFunds, a disposable income budgeting app, and 4) Shoot The Breeze, a much less lonely chat app.

Overall, I felt like I actually wrote less code this mod than in Mod 1. Part of that might be that I was in a 4-person group for one of the projects, and part of it was that a lot of the learning this mod was about tools--webpack, webdriver/selenium, sass, enzyme, and react. There was a lot of npm installing, --save-deving, and cursing. But it was all necessary to lead into the last few projects, when we really got cooking with react, which was awesome.

## D: Professional Skills

I guess this is as good a place as any to put my example DTR:

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Mike:
_Mike was a great project partner. I feel like he picked up a lot of slack as my energy lagged towards the end of our chat project. I was surprised at his styling chops, and he took on a majority of bringing out wireframes into reality. Sometimes I was worried that I got too tunnel-visioned into our javascript and deprived him of coding opportunities—I hope that wasn’t the case. I’d encourage Mike to make sure to speak up/take on the tasks that are outside his comfort zone, even if it’s only ‘driving,’ to continue growing his comfort level. Overall working relationship seemed pretty seamless, and I’d be happy to work together again._

To MaryJane:
 _MaryJane was a great partner on the Pomodoro project. She helped keep us accountable for the things I felt lazy about (like testing), and took on the lion’s share of the styling. I appreciated her flexibility to work with me over screenhero in the evenings, and her encourage sharing the ‘driving’, which I consider very important. Her persistent drive to understand the code led to both of us learning a lot together. It would be a pleasure to work together again._

To Brett:
_I worked with Brett on the tier two project (budget app). Brett’s energy and work ethic were very motivating and he pushed our group forward. It was super helpful to have him holding the group accountable for meeting our goals, and his great sense of humor helped brighten the mood when things got difficult. One opportunity for Brett is to help ensure that his group-mates are all getting equal learning opportunities—he picks up on things super fast, so it’s easy for him to bite off a disproportionate amount of the labor, so maybe some of that energy could be spent on tutoring groupmates and aiding their learning? In general, Brett and I work well together, and I look forward to working with him again._

To Pete:
_I’ve worked with Pete on the last two projects of the mod, and it’s been great. We both have an easygoing style and pace, and similar standards, which is nice since pace and standards differences have usually been the hardest parts of pairing. He’s a good coder and encourages us to forge through the less glamorous parts of products (mobile styling, testing, etc.). He’s easy to work with, cares about details, and cares about his group-mates and their learning. Even though we’ve been stuck together for 3 weeks, I’d be super excited to pair again anytime._

To Kris:
_I was in Kris’s group for the Tier-Two project. Although she had time constraints due to some pressing contract work, she still made time to contribute valuable input to our project, especially in terms of design and styling. Due to her conflicting (but well-communicated!) obligations, Kris received some unfairly brusque attitude during this project, and it seemed to damage her confidence. I’d encourage Kris to reflect on how much hard work she’s put into Turing, and how much she’s learned. She deserves to let herself feel proud and confident, and I hope she practices embracing her accomplishments._

### Being a Community Member

From Mike:
_Not sure I learned more from any of my partners than I did from Casey - he was a great partner with an amazing skillset.  I fully attribute my improved refactoring efforts to my observations of Casey and his meticulous method of coding and problem solving. He was superlative at taking the reigns and really driving the project and an overall great personality - very easy to get along with. It’s also worth mentioning that Casey is a superb teacher, walking me through concepts that had previously confused me, and making me overall quite comfortable with content that I struggled with. I’m excited for him to do great things, and would love to have further collaboration going forward._

From MaryJane:
_I really enjoyed working with you on the Pomodoro app, Casey, and I’m happy with how it turned out. Thank you for being patient with me and explaining the parts I didn’t understand. I appreciated your steady attitude when we encountered problems, especially at the end when the JS wasn’t working on real browsers. Looking forward to working with you on a future project._

From Brett:
_I worked with Casey on the tier two project (budget app). In addition to being super smart and quick to pick stuff up, Casey’s thoroughness and attention to detail were crucial to the success of our project. He’s a patient and open communicator and he’s also super willing to laugh at stuff and doesn’t take himself too seriously, which is a big plus. I’d happily work with Casey again anytime._

From Pete:
_Casey and I spent many hours together this module. His organization, focus
and calm demeanor make him easy to work with. I find Casey to be a strong problem solver that I  enjoy comparing approaches with. One thing I really appreciated while working with Casey was his discipline to map out a plan before diving into a project. I look forward to the next time Casey and I get to work together._

From Kris:
_I deeply enjoyed working with Casey.  He has a great design eye and built some beautiful comps.  He came up with the concept that branded the app and it was really well received.  He is very empathetic and has a good sense of what needs to be done to color the climate of a group.  I regret not taking more of this project on and missing the chance to work with him more.  I popped in and out and tried to add what I could but I split my priorities too much and I didn’t feel like I brought much to the table.  He always took the time to bring me back into the project and was consistently welcoming and encouraging.  He seems to take on challenges and road blocks with patience, determination, and a sense of humor.  The code he creates is really impressive and he is able to grasp it with remarkable precision.  I would love to work with Casey again and I’m so glad I had the chance to get to know him._  

### Playing a Part

My role in Pahlka has grown significantly since many of the mod 3 and 4 leaders have graduated or dropped off due to time constraints. It happened quickly, and we just had and inter-posse nomination process for next mod's official leaders, and I was unanimously nominated. It feels like a lot of pressure and time, but I'll see what I can do.

(Likewise, although it's not a given, it's looking very likely that I'll get the vote for SAB next mod. I think I can contribute a calm and even-handed voice to larger Turing discussions, and I'm looking forward to it, but again I'm worried about leaving time for academics.)

In addition to Pahlka, I've done a lot of 1608 tutoring this mod, and the feedback they've given is that I explain things well. I've helped on at least 4 different Game-Times, and tried to be a good resource for my 1606 cohort as well.

And then there's the Great Friday Fallout Of 2016. I helped Beth, Allison, and the team by facilitating one of the discussion groups and by debriefing after the screening (but before the real drama). I don't have much else to say about this here, other than mentioning that I generally try to defend Turing and its mission and culture, while still trying to respect the concerns of my cohort-mates.
