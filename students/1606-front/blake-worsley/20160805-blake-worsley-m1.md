### Areas of Emphasis

This module, my goal was to establish a foundation of knowledge around javascript, css and html. I wanted to get a grasp of the basics and take the time to go back over my projects and fully understand what I was working on. I also wanted to get involved in the community and develop an understanding of what was required to be successful in this industry.

I have begun the process of mentoring and have learned more than I can imagine in terms of Javascript. I am impressed with what I have been able to create in short time periods and have got a much firmer grasp of the language. Going forward I will continue to work on the fundamentals and break down big problems into smaller ones more proactively

### End of Module Assessment

### Work

During this module I completed the work below as follows.

#### Color Changer

* [Link to Project](https://github.com/blakeworsley/color-changer)
* [Github URL](https://blakeworsley.github.io/color-changer/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/color-changer.html)

I created a page with two buttons, a reset, and a color change. When the color change button was clicked a random hex value was generated and the background of the page was changed. If the color was white (the default color). The random number would regenerate. If the reset button was clicked, the background would return to its initial color.

### Giving Feedback

My feedback to my partners is as follows:

**Pete Ideabox Feedback:**

>Pete and I ended up with a solid ideabox concept when we presented. Pete was very good about taking the time to explain concepts he had undertaken and completed and was willing to do whatever it took to output an excellent finished project. I do think we both came into the project with ambitions to learn above all else and I feel like we had conflicting ideology of what to do next at different points throughout the project. Looking back, I think if we created a more concrete plan of how we wanted to proceed through some of the complicated parts of the project, we would have been able to collaborate more effectively during pairing sessions. Otherwise Pete was great to work with and I am glad I had him on this project.

**Jeff Number Guesser Feedback**

>It was a pleasure working with Jeff on the number guesser project. Jeff clearly has a firm grasp on the material and was very strong in the javascript concepts even being the first time that we had worked with them. I really donâ€™t have much critical feedback to give Jeff. I feel that he may have gone ahead a bit on his own for some of the final aspects of the project but at the time we had split up some of the work so it is to be expected. It was great working with him and I look forward to doing so in the future.

**Kyle Linked List Feedback**

>Had a great time working with you on linked list. We had a great opportunity to work through a difficult project together. We successfully delivered a final project and learned how to navigate git well in the process. The only critique I would give is that at times I would have liked to have a bit more control over what was happening. In the future I think taking turns switching who controls the flow when pairing will be beneficial. Thanks again though for everything and I look forward to working with you soon!

**MaryJane Game Time Jr. Feedback**

>I really had a wonderful time working with you on the project. I think we both came at it with similar strengths and worked very well to complete the project together. I appreciated you suggesting that we work on the station together because it allowed us to collaborate effectively. I really don't have much constructive criticism to give other than to keep practicing the concepts which is obviously something that both of us need to work on as we are 6 weeks into the program. Otherwise great job and I look forward to working again!


### Being a Community Member

The feedback I received is below:

#### Ideabox Feedback

>Blake and I worked together on ideabox. The project was a success and I feel that we were able to collaborate very effectively. At times throughout the project Blake seemed highly stressed. I think this may have been from not fully understanding some syntax(for loops?). I think as Blake gets more comfortable using documentation the unknown will become less stressful and possibly even a little fun.

**Personal Number Guesser Feedback**

>It was great working with Blake and Iâ€™m really glad we were partnered up for the first project.  We worked really well together and were able to map out and work through the problems together.  Blake also has some great design chops and really made our project stand out.  The only actionable feedback is that we were both eager to get code on the screen which didnâ€™t work out as well as the times when we stopped and mapped out/pseudo-coded the problem we were trying to solve and what steps we needed to take to solve it.  Once we started doing that things went a lot smoother and I think we can both keep that in mind on future projects.   I look forward to working with Blake on other projects in future modules!

**Personal Linked List Feedback**

>Really enjoyed working with you on this project. From beginning to end we both worked hard to not only deliver a great final product but to learn along the way. I donâ€™t feel like we strayed at all from our DTR. Additionally, I feel like linked list was the project where we struggled through Git & Github and came out making great strides in our understanding of how to use it. I did notice that after trying something only a few times youâ€™d get pretty agitated & stressed that it wasnâ€™t working. I think keeping a level head & being aware of when a big problem needs to be broken down into smaller ones will pay large dividends for you over your career as a developer. Looking forward to working with you again!

**Personal Game Time Feedback**

>Blake and I both started this project with similar strengths and weaknesses so I wasnâ€™t sure how that would balance out. It turned out to work really well because we focused a lot of our energies on the JS to make sure we really understood what everything was doing. Blake seemed to pick up some of the JS faster than I but he was great and making sure that I understood what was going on. We made lists to keep ourselves organized - which helped us get back on track when we jumped around. I really enjoyed working with Blake, his enthusiasm made this a great project.

### Playing a Part

Early in my time here at turing, I was invited to be a part of the Student Advisory Board and actively led and engaged our cohort in our weekly group retros. I conducted surveys and sat in on meetings with the staff. I was also involved in the Turing podcast and engaged in multiple outing with 1606. My mentor previously attended turing and I had the opportunity to spend time with him every week as well.
I engaged in group meetups and networked with speakers as they visited our classes.

### Notes
walking in expectations, knew some css and html but really wanted to focus on JS. expected it to be hard, probably was pretty accurate. has has  a few moments of feeling discouraged and frustrated, but has pushed through and feels good.

community work has been a strong presence, wants to be involved more, teach more, help others more.

### Outcome

PASS
