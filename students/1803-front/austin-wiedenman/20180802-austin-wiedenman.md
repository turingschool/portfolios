# Austin Wiedenman - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
Seeing the material for the second time,  one of my goals to get very comfortable with react and redux workflow. I also wanted to get better at testing.  Testing is one thing that I felt really unsure of last mod and was a huge area of emphasis this mod. 

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass. I felt very confident in my react and redux skills despite getting hung up at one spot.  I think that overall it went really well.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The two individual projects this mod were SWAPI-Box and my personal project. I feel really good about both of them. This time through the Mod I felt like I was able to take in more information. Being more calm and collected has allowed me to absorb more. I was able to get through all the functionality of SWapi-box without much trouble and was able to begin to understand react testing. My personal project is what I am most proud of because I was able to implement both the Google maps api and learn express/ postgress. This project was really interesting to me also in subject matter and I am excited that there is much more I can accomplish in the future to improve it's functionality.

#### SWAPI-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Awiedenman/swapi-box2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

A react app that pulls in Star Wars data for planets, people, etc, and displays it. The user is able to browse and "favorite" cards and store them using local state. I learned to work with nested fetch calls on this project, and really worked to improve my knowledge of testing.

#### Personal Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Awiedenman/wildFire)
* [GitHub URL-backend](https://github.com/Awiedenman/wildFire-backend)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

Is an application that utilizes react, redux, router, express/postgres to fetch information about current wildfires from the USGS and plot them onto google maps.  Users are able to browse current fires and post new fires to the backend and post them on the map.  The main use for this application would be to eventually allow people to submit fires to autorities and allow them to verify them.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Our two group projects this module were Headcount and MovieTracker. Headcount used school district data to display cards, with the ability to compare cards. MovieTracker uses an api to bring in current movie data and displays that information, with the ability for users to log in and store favorite movies.

#### Headcount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/airum82/headcount2.1)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0/scores.md)

Headcount uses school district data to display cards, with the ability to compare cards. This project came a lot easier my second time around and made me feel more comfortable with both using react and testing react.

#### MovieTracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Awiedenman/movie-tracker-2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker/scores.md)

A React app that pulls movie data from an API and displays current movies, with functionality for users to log in and save favorites using Redux and Postgres.

## D: Professional Skills
Did a lot of stuff to prepare for getting a job, from creating a new resume to some warm outreach. Now it's time to get this job search started!

* [Turing Online Portfolio]()  I have tried to create it 5 times now and it is not working. Allison is aware of this.

### Gear Up

#### Microaggressions

Microagressions are a very real and subtle.  They can be very harmful because you don't always realize right away when they are happening, so we have to try and be very aware. It is even more impotant, being a person that doesnt regularly find themselves on the receiving end of microagressions, for me to speak up and do my part if that situation should ever arise.

#### Parable of the polygons

I think that the issue of how people interact and how groups are represented in the tech industry is a very important topic.  It is important to know how we are influenced and how our biases, concious or not, affect our decission making. Being part of the majority group in the tech indestry, it is even more important for me to be aware.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I have done some work paring with mod 1 and 2 students.  We are plannig a resurgance of Pahlka next mod.
