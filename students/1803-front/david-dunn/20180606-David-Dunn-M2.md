## Areas of Emphasis

_What was your learning focus this inning? What technical and communication skills did you want to grow? Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?_

This inning, I wanted to focus on solidifying my understanding of ES6 and gain a basic understanding of how react works. I also worked to improve my use of technical jargon as well as practice talking about my story. By this time , my command of ES6 has greatly improved and I do feel like I can handle basic react. My storytelling is getting better, but still needs some work.

## Self-Evaluation

* **E: Final Assessment**: _?_

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

I definitely enjoyed sorting suite and comlete-me and the challenges they presented. Both were geat opportunities to practice javascript and logic. Merge-sort proved to be the most challenging, but building on my previous experience I was able to get through it the first day. The key to my success here so far has been actively participating in class sessions and practicing concepts every day. This is a habit I definitely plan on maintaining into mod3. One thing I will try to do more is study the lessons before we work through them in class.

### Study Habits

_What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same? Do your study habits serve you well?_
My routine hasn't changed much since mod1, as it seems to be working for me. I have gotten better at taking breaks and reaching out for help/input from mentors and classmates.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** _Pass_

_What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Sorting suite was fun because it was a pure logical challenge, and didn't invole much challenging syntax. Also, I enjoyed working on this project alone, without distractions or the potential that I could steal someone's learning. Sorting suite was also a chance to use recursion, which I enjoyed putting to work.

### Complete Me
* **Outcome:** _Pass_

_What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Complete Me compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Complete Me was another solo project during which I enjoyed learning about data structures and practicing OOP. Outside of working on keeping my code dry and using single responsibility functions, this project really helped me get comfortable with testing. Also, it was nice to be able to put it to use later in weatherly.

## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

### GameTime
* **Partner:** _Quin Hill_
* **Game:** _Snake_
* **Functional Expectations:** _ 4_
* **User Interface:** _3_
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** _2.5_
* **JS Style:** _2.75_
* **Workflow:** _2.75_

_What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Game Time was fun because it gave us something to show friends that they could interact with. The most challenging parts were dealing with the context of canvas and trying to test everything. Gametime definitely improved my understanding and skills regarding object oriented programming, as well as the basics of html canvas.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** _Partner's Name_
* **Spec Adherence:** _0 - 4_
* **User Interface:** _0 - 4_
* **HTML Style:** _0 - 4_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _0 - 4_
* **JS/React Style:** _0 - 4_
* **Testing:** _0 - 4_
* **Workflow:** _0 - 4_
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_

_What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Weatherly was fun because we got to use react, and because it ended up being a practical, fully functional app. The most difficult part of Weatherly was handling the node modules and to hook up complete me and getting our tests to run. I feel like this project forced me to understand react, and while the testing seemed hard at first, I feel pretty good about it at this point.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
* _Agile practices_
* _Storytelling 2_
* _Feedback 3_
* _Outreach and networking_

_What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?_

The main idea I'm taking away from the PD sessions this mod is the importance of practinging outreach and selling myself. Making new connection and networking is something that I will continue to focus on in mod3.

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * _Empathy_
  * _Getting better at difficult things_
  * _Civic Tech_

_What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising? Do you find it important to have conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions? Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future? in your workplace? with your teammates?_

For me, the gearups emphasized the need to be sensitive to people's varying points of view, and practice having tough conversations from a position of respect and understanding. I feel relatively comfortable being able to express myself in a professional/team environment in a thoughtful empathetic manner.

## Community Participation

_Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing? in Denver? Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable? Illuminating?_

I did enjoy pairing with mod1 students this inning, as it was an opportunity to practice my skills while helping others in a meaningful way. Also, I attended Iron FE sessions.

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission week? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?_

I'd like to practice writing another mod1 project in react and maybe practice some css. In addition to coding, I want to reach out to some warm contacts and meet with some mentors. Otherwise, I'm planning on enjoying some outdoor activities and make some music.
