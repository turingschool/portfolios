#### PSYCH1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gavin-love/psych1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

This application pulls the most recent 20 movies from the MovieDbApi at, https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api, and displays them with title, vote average, and image. The app uses modular card components to render different data. There is a favorite option that allows users to "favorite" movies and keep track of their favorite movies. The app is fully responsive. Building this application was a chance for me to experience an agile workflow, working with a client. I updated his outdated website to be responsive, accessible, and with an emphasis on SEO. I used React, Redux, and Router to fetch and display the most recent news articles pertinent to the various pages.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I've paired with people in Mod2 on GameTime and helped people in mod2 on React. Always made an effor to maintain high morale within the class. We can all be struggling, working on something, but maintaining high spirits is the best way to still enjoy it.
