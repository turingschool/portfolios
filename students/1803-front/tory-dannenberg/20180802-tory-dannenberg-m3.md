## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for this mod were to get better at testing, be as engaged as possible, learn from as many resources as I can find, help classmates and become better at pairing.

#### SWAPI-Box

* [SWAPI-Box](https://github.com/tdberg21/swapibox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)


For this project, we are going to work on developing some muscle memory building out React components. At this point you’ve built at least one basic React app in the past. Now’s the time to leverage that and add some complexity.

For this project, we will be hitting The Star Wars API to tap into a “black hole” of Star Wars data. Mwahaha.

Ever have trouble picking your favorite Nicolas Cage Movie? Cage Tracker is a dynamic application that allows a user to see a list of the most popular Nicolas Cage movies and a summary of each movie, built with React, Router and Redux. The user can create an account and add movies to a favorites page, which the user can reference whenever they need to pick a movie to watch! A tribute to the greatest actor of all time.
