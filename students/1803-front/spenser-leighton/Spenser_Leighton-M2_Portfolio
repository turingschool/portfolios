## Areas of Emphasis

My focus this inning was mainly one of personal growth. I aimed to become more vocal with my classmates as well as more active in the classroom. As far as technical skills, my goal was to become more fluent and comfortable with JavaScript and the technical vocabulary that comes with it. I think I was mostly successful. I loved watching my cohort come together to overcome obstacles both large and small. I feel confident in my ability to communicate my code using proper vocabulary.

## Self-Evaluation
_How do you feel you did in these areas this inning?_

* **A: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **B: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **C: Professional Skills**: 3
* **D: Community Participation**: 2.8
* **E: Final Assessment**: _0 - 4_

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

I feel that I did pretty well on individual projects we were assigned. By far the most challenging thing I've done at Turing was the Complete-Me project. It was also the most beneficial to my JavaScript skills. When the project was done my confidence was much higher than it was prior. Next inning I intend on sticking to the plan I set out for myself this inning. It seemed to work well for me and, granted me many small victories. 

### Study Habits

I really enjoyed the "slow release of responsibility" in Mod2; it forced me to develop stronger study habits, and for that I am thankful. I had much more time to sit down and make sure I knew what was going on before diving headfirst into something else. It turns out that embracing time boxing is important. The habits that I created for myself this inning served me very well.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** _Pass/Fail_

Although not my favorite project, I did enjoy this challenge. Much like Complete-Me, I felt much more confident in myself and my ability to write JavaScript when it was all said and done. As far as my personal areas of emphasis go, it definitely got me out of my shell and communicating more with my classmates. Knowing these things will definitely help me during the interview process and will also help me stand out from other boot camp attendees.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** _0 - 4_
* **Testing:** _0 - 4_
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** _0 - 4_
* **Functional Expectations:** _0 - 4_
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_

_What did you enjoy about Complete-Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weatherly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Complete-Me was in interesting project for me, both very challenging and rewarding. It really helped me solidify my ability to write JavaScript. Much like Sorting Suite, I think it will be very beneficial for me outside of Turing.

## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

I much enjoyed the group projects this inning. Both GameTime and Weatherly were very fun challenges for me. GameTime definitely helped me understand the importance of good file structure, something I hadn't often thought about before the project was assigned. Weatherly was awesome. It felt like my first real project. It was very fun to watch live data come in and change things in an app that I had built. The most challenging part of everything to me would be testing. I think I love testing? But am not the greatest at it yet, and I fully understand that it's importance and plan on that being one of my main focuses over break and into next inning.

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Keeliana
* **Game:** Snake
* **Functional Expectations:** _0 - 4_
* **User Interface:** _0 - 4_
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_
* **JS Style:** _0 - 4_
* **Workflow:** _0 - 4_

_What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

GameTime was the first project I've completed at Turing that was interactive at such a high level. I really enjoyed making something that people could play around with. The most challenging part of the project for me was refactoring. It made me take approaches to things in ways I never would have thought to do on my own. I think that was the most valuable take away for me, that made me really take someone elseâ€™ direction, and it was for the better.


### Weatherly
* **Partner:** Quin
* **Spec Adherence:** _0 - 4_
* **User Interface:** _0 - 4_
* **HTML Style:** _0 - 4_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _0 - 4_
* **JS/React Style:** _0 - 4_
* **Testing:** _0 - 4_
* **Workflow:** _0 - 4_
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_

_What did you enjoy about Weatherly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I enjoyed everything about Weatherly. The most challenging task we came across was bundling our prefix trie, that was said to be very easy, but proved very difficult. My main takeaway from weatherly was learning and understanding how React works. React is awesome and I can't wait to keep building on the skills I've already acquired. 

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  *Agile Practices & Leadership
  *Feedback II
  *Feedback III
  *Storytelling II
  *Outreach & Networking

I feel that I definitely honed in better communication skills in these PD sessions. Not just communicating between two people but communicating my story and how to let people know who I am in a professional manner. I feel more prepared for my future life as a developer every day.

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  *Week 1: Empathy
  *Week 3: Getting Better at Difficult Things
  *Week 5: You probably won't come to this

The most beneficial of all the Gear Up Sessions was week 5, "You probably won't come to this." We had a lot of great conversations about self doubt being passed around. It was a nice reminder going into week 6 (and the professional world) to stay in that growth mindset and keep grinding away at things that at first seem extremely difficult. It reminded me to remember how far I've come in such a short period of time. I feel confident that I will be able to continue having these conversations in the future.

## Community Participation

My life outside of school makes it very difficult to be super involved in the community here at school but I do what I can. I attended multiple social events on and off campus and helped a few students in Mod1 when I was available to. Next inning I hope to have more time available to give back. 

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission weeek? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?_

Over intermission I intend to hammer down some testing skills. I plan on building and testing a small React app every two days. I also plan on diving deeper into array prototypes and object manipulation. I can't wait to hang out with my family and get pumped for Mod3.
