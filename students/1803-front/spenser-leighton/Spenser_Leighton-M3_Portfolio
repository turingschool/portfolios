# Spenser Leighton - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I wanted to come out of mod 3 with a solid understanding of react.

## Self Assessment
Mod 3 was crucial to my becoming a developer. I learned a ton, not only about writing code but about what I want to do with my new found skillset. I really enjoyed pushing myself and really realizing and utilizing the tools I have in my toolbox.

## Community participation
Participated in Code Fair, Paired with students from Mod 2, and hosting a weekly study hall on Sundays.

## Individual Work & Projects

#### SWAPI-Box

SWAPI-Box was meant to develop some muscle memory building out React components. We used a Star Wars API to tap into and display a variety of Star Wars data using good old React.

#### HeadCount

HeadCount was a project designed to challenge our skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components. It also encouraged us to do TDD for the first time which was really nice.

#### MovieTracker

Movie Tracker was probably the largest and most fun project. It was the first project requiring a backend and building out log in, sign in and sign up forms.
