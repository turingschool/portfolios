# Jeremiah  - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this inning was to cement my understand of React, redux, and react-router, because these are the technologies I hope to be using in my career. I also wanted to feel proficient with React testing, and capable of test-driven-development in React.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I really enjoy working on my own, so I enjoyed both of my individual projects. I think I really the concepts a little better when the responsbility for the project is entirely on me. However, there were multiple times during both of these project when another set of eyes could have prevented time-consuming and simple mistakes. 

### SWAPI Box
[GitHub Repo](hhttps://github.com/jeremiahjstanley/swapi-box)
[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

This project was interesting, and it taught me a lot decoupling functionality for testing. I also learned how to used Async/Await syntax and how it makes testing a bit easier. I'm not really a star wars fan (I've never seen the movies ðŸ˜¬) but! I imagine, if I was this would have been really cool.

### Hello World
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jeremiahjstanley/hello-world)
[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

This project was my favorite individual project, that's probably not surprising considering I picked it, but it talk me alot about middlware and thunks, when to put things in the redux store, and how to use UI for error handling.

## C: Group Work & Projects


### Headcount 2.0

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jeremiahjstanley/headcount2.0)
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

I really enjoyed working with Marika again, this project was fun for that reason. I learned a lot about testing react, advantages and disadvantages of datastructures, and how to refactor complicated code in this project. 

**Partner**: Marika Ross

### Cage Tracker

This project was the best. When else do you get to make an application completely devoted to Nicolas Cage with a shoutout to everyone's favorite 90's family comedy Captain Ron? Never that's when. On a more serious note, I really enjoy learning React-Router on this project and creating the UI.

Shoutout to Casey Poe!

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
[Microaggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod3_Week1_Microaggressions_update.md)

I think that this session was really important, and I think that tech has a serious diversity and empathy deficit. I felt like there was a general feeling of 'we don't do this' among the people in our mod during this session, and I wish there was a better way to communicate to our mod that we absolutely do. 

[Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Rotation_Session_Tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

I'm really passionate about diversity and preventing gentrification, I think that this Gear Up session is incredibly important. I thought that the  Parable of the Polygons: A Playable Post on the Shape of Society was a great way to show how this happens and how these choices that people made even 30 years ago have prolonged and lasting effect. Again, as I said about the microaggression session, I'm not sure how to put people in a situation where they are able to recognize their privilege and implicit bias. 

[You're not an Imposter: You belong to the light, you belong to the thunder.](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1806-inning/group1.md)

This sesssion was really fun, and I knew about Imposter Syndrome broadly, and the session gave better context for the subsequent types of imposters and how they can manifest. Also, I just really love 1801.

## E: Community Participation

This inning I praticipated in the Turing community by being an SAP rep, giving a top talk, competeing in the Code Fair, and presenting at demo night.
