## Areas of Emphasis

_What was your learning focus this inning? What technical and communication skills did you want to grow? 
Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?_

I understand that most developer's jobs entail working with array prototypes and forms. I really wanted to ensure that I was comfortable using array and object prototypes to access data within large and/or complex data structures. I feel like I can now adequately assess what array prototype is appropriate to use when navigating a complex data structure.

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis 
(from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning?
What do you plan to change?_

I wish there was a greater emphasis on implementing array prototypes in the scope of projects that we were assigned in mod 2. I used several array prototypes in Game Time, including several nested array prototypes and array prototypes where I implemented all three arguments in their callback functions; however, I wish there was more opportunity to see the practical application of array prototypes through navigating API calls as we did in Weathrly.

### Study Habits

_What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same? 
Do your study habits serve you well?_

I attended all of the Iron Fe study sessions; those sessions really helped me get a handle on the implementation of array prototypes. In general, my process stayed more or less the same. I try to get to Turing early, around 7:30 - 8:00 am and leave around 7:00 pm or so. I see my peers and the students in upper mods as a valuable asset, so I think that having time with them to collectively tackle problems deepens my understanding of the topics we cover in class. 

### Sorting Suite

* **Outcome:** _Pass/Fail_

_What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your 
work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your 
overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jeremiahjstanley/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

I hadn't really thought about how sorting algorithms were constructed in code, so this project helped me understand how relatively simple and concise blocks of code can have powerful modular real-world applications. SortingSuite was incredibly challenging for me to understand, particularly BubbleSort and InsertionSort. The nested loops in BubbleSort and InsertionSort and the movement direction was confusing for me. I enjoy paired projects, so working on this project alone was difficult. The algorithms that I created did not originally use any array prototypes, but I refactored my QuickSort to use a forEach. During our code challenge with Jeff this mod, he suggested that we would be wise to understand and be able to implement several algorithms. He said that these algorithms are a potential question/technical challenge that interviewers pose. 

### Complete Me

* **Testing:** _0 - 4_
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** _0 - 4_
* **Functional Expectations:** _0 - 4_
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_

_What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jeremiahjstanley/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

CompleteMe gave me a picture of how application features that I interact with daily are constructed. Before CompleteMe, I was familiar with trie data structures; however, CompleteMe gave me a clearer picture that branches are actually nested pathways within the context of a greater data set. I enjoyed that CompleteMe gave our mod the opportunity to tackle a complex problem collectively. I learned about my peers' process by watching them work through this problem and saw opportunities for me to improve my own process through watching them problem solve.

## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

### GameTime
* **Partner:** _Marika Ross_
* **Game:** _Centipede_
* **Functional Expectations:** _0 - 4_
* **User Interface:** _0 - 4_
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_
* **JS Style:** _0 - 4_
* **Workflow:** _0 - 4_

_What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marikaross/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

I really enjoyed GameTime overall, and this probably because I'm a front-end student, but I really like having a final project that I can see and interact with. I also really enjoyed being paired with Marika for GameTime, I felt that we had a good rapport and balanced each other well. This project taught me a lot about navigating file structures, ES6 syntax, and object-oriented programming. I also encounter a use case where I used all three arguments in an array prototype methods' callback function. I think my biggest talk-away from GameTime was a deeper understanding of unit tests and how to construct and navigate a more complex code base. 

### Weathrly

_What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jeremiahjstanley/Weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

I loved getting to learn React, and I would like to find a job that allows me to write in react. I think that this project was a good introduction to react, and learning how to get data from an API call. Weathrly taught me a lot about how many new applications are created and scaled. Learning when to make components stateful vs stateless was a challenge in Weathrly, it was also challenging to learn where and how to pass props from the parent component to the children components. I think that my biggest struggle with react will be learning how to test react well and effectively so that I can create my future projects with test-driven-development.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * Week 1: Agile Practices and Leadership
  * Week 2: Feedback II
  * Week 3: Storytelling II
  * Week 4: Feedback III
 
_What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?_

The session on Agile taught me about the development process and gave me new insights into my past experience with professional software development. The last startup I worked for told everyone that we practiced agile development, but our process was actually waterfall. These sessions gave me good information about what to look for in a corporate environment when I begin job hunting. I also learned how I can begin to cultivate a professional network in the tech community while I am still attending Turing. 

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * Week 1: Empathy and Privilege
  * Week 3: Getting Better at Difficult Things
  * Week 5: AI caramba

_What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising? Do you find it important to have conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions? Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future? in your workplace? with your teammates?_

I really enjoyed the TED talk we watched during Getting Better at Difficult Things, I thought that was a really interesting concept. I want have such a deep understanding of code that I can intuitively look at it and know what is wrong and what is right. I believe that we don't talk about power and privilege enough, so I believe the sessions we have on privilege are incredibly valuable. I try to challenge people to recognize the arenas in which they have privilege, and I am always interested in learning new tools for having difficult conversations in productive ways. 

## Community Participation

_Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing? in Denver? Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable? Illuminating?_

I really tried to invest in my peers in my cohort this mod. I think that the challenges we faced this mod were an opportunity for us to become a tighter-knit group. I paired with mod 1 students this module and led several lunch sessions on mythical creatures. Pairing with mod1 students gave me perspective and appreciation for how far I have come since starting here at Turing. I also continued to meet with my assigned mentor every-other-week which helped me learn more about the engineering community in Denver and the broader Turing community. I believe (I'm not actually 100% on this) that I'll be one of our mod's SAB reps next inning, so I look forward in continuing to invest in the community here at Turing.

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission week? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?_

I really enjoy unit testing and I would like to cultivate a better understanding of how to test applications built with react. I really want to dive into react during the intermission and cultivate a degree of comfort with the framework. I am going to allow myself to rest, sleep-in, and take several days off where I can just enjoy the summer during intermission. I know that mod 3 is time intensive, and I want to prepare myself for the inning by coming well-rested.
