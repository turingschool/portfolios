## Module 3 (Front-end) - Individual Goals for the Module

[Turing Alum Profile](https://www.turing.io/alumni/theresa-marquis)

Individual Self Assessment

I have achieved a rapport with my cohort members while learning the content of Mod3.  
I am competent in React and Redux.
When I have time to reflect, I am sure I will be encouraged that I have learned as much as I have, though the learning that Turing facilitates is really just the first step on my road toward a software developer career.

Final Assessment (PASS)

Included Projects: Headcount 2.0 (Group), SWAPIBox (Individual), Movie Tracker (Group), and Self-Directed Project (Individual)

## D: Professional Skills

 * Cover Letter review workshop and Cover Letter personalized recommendations from Ian Douglas
 * Made tw pull requests to open source Turing lessons
 * Used Job Track several times

### Microaggressions GearUp

* Learned that not everyone recognizes microaggressions or takes them seriously.  In the spirit of empathy with all people, I take the microaggressions seriously, but have blind spots that I hope I will make less blind as I grow.

### Parable of the Polygon

* A very instructive visual and interactive lesson that illustrates the requirements for a group to offset segregation.

### Relaxation GearUp

* Learned some useful stretching exercises for full body and for hands, which is especially useful for me in my coding career if I am sitting down for long periods.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I participatd in the school bake-off and the two front-end mod3 Crock-pot Fridays.
I went to the Friday morning speaker, Kai, kkh@kkh.io, and I plan to connect with him to learn more about the robotic process automation that he spoke about.
