## Individual Goals for the Module

My individual goals for the module were to get more comfortable writing my own code and understanding React at a deeper level. I've definitely done both, but there's always room for more growth.  Technical terms and explanations continue to elude me and I will definitely need to practice and sign up for mock interviews.  The work in mod 3 really helped cement concepts we learned in mod 2 and was also great practice for the new material we learned.  

## Individual Self-Assessment
I think I grew a lot in the mod, in terms of my coding skills.  I also learned a lot about how I work and that will most definitely inform my job search.  I get quite a bit of work done alone, but I am more likely to ask for help if I'm in a group environment if I get stuck on something.  I have room to improve in many areas such as using technical terms, expanding my knowledge of destructuring techniques, and general syntax.

## Final Assessment
PASS

## Included Projects 
[HeadCount 2.0](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1803/mod-3/headcount/marika-jeremiah/scores.md) 
HeadCount was a good refresher of react to get us started in mod 3.  If I could change one thing it would be the comparison formula.  What are we even comparing?  Why is it not the difference of the two districts? 

[SWAPIbox](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1803/mod-3/swapi-box/marika/scores.md) SWAPIbox was great for a variety of reasons.  I focused on async testing and dodn't quite make it through the spec, but I plan to go back and create issues for that project in GitHub.  I think it also gave people some perspective on working alone vs working together.

[MovieTracker](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1803/mod-3/movie-tracker/david-joel-marika/scores.md) MovieTracker was a great project to start redux.  I think maybe I would give a little more info about the back-end before you set people free.  We spent quite a bit of time trying to figure it out...but once we did that, it was easy (relatively).

### Personal Project (Cheese-Louise)
Scores have not yet been posted.  This project provided many valuable learning experiences.  First, not all APIs are that great. Second, mvp's are always good to keep in mind and a good first goal to reach.  It can be overwhelming to think of your absolute final product when you have very little code written.  Third, you need to spend a lot of time in your program and invite other people to do the same so you can find bugs early, not at 11:30 the night before it's due.  Lastly, CSS will make you feel good about your project.  As much as I complain about CSS I think doing bits along the way do a lot for morale.  Also, it makes a silly look moderately serious.   

## Contributions to the Community 
This is probably my strongest area at Turing.  This mod, I took charge of Monday morning iron-fes.  I wish I had had more time to create exercises for them.  It's a good way to keep array prototype methods fresh and also a good way to become more comfortable in situations where you may not know everything (which is all the time).  I had planned to do a schoolwide lightning talk again this mod, but was a bit overwhelmed by the work load.  Hopefully I can do it next mod.
