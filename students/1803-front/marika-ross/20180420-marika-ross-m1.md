# (Marika Ross) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Having little experience working with computers on a daily basis and even less experience coding, my learning goals were very broad for Mod1.  Learning one coding language is a job in and of itself and I feel confident in saying that after Mod1 I am able to use more than one language comfortably.  HTML and CSS provided an excellent introduction before the more involved languages of JavaScript and jQuery.  While I am by no means fluent in any coding language, my knowledge and understanding of these languages is far more comprehensive than I expected. 

I actually really enjoyed studying for the assessments because I felt like I finally got to solidify the skills that we had used throughout the projects, but never had a chance to really synthesize them for myself. I was a very tentative code-writer in the beginning of the mod and working alone forced me to get more comfortable working on my computer and in my terminal/text-editor.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Number Guesser was the first project I ever attempted that involved JavaScript and DOM manipulation.  
Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100 and is guided by hints until they guess correctly.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Use two input fields to create new "bookmarks" on a blank portion of the page.  It served as an exercise in becoming familiar with parent/child element relationships and how to leverage them to your advantage.

#### (LinkedList)

FEEDBACK from Kylee:
I want to begin by saying thank you for your work ethic and motivation while working on this project. The time and dedication you put into learning and implementing jQuery was the reason we got into phase 3 of Linked List. Looking back, I'm realizing  we never talked about our individual learning and communication styles and that had a great impact on our workflow.  I think we worked well together in the first two phases and tackled our GitHub issues accordingly, and if we were able to keep up that momentum in other areas, like remote pairing, and reaching out for help and I think our final submission would have reflected a complete joint effort. My coaching feedback for this pairing is to try the rubber duck method throughout the life of the project with future pairing partners so they are up to date with any new changes and ideas. Also, being  more inclusive and trusting with new information that comes your way. When remote pairing, there was a big chunk of time where I was in the dark about what was being worked on  and during a time we scheduled to screen share I waited a half hour while you went ask for help  By the time we got to screen share,  the problem was solved then explained to me. If included, I am confident we could research or reach out to find the answers as a team to have a shared learning experience. I am happy with the final product; and overall, what I took away from pairing with you. 

#### (IdeaBox)

A continuation of the LinkedList themes that further layered on JSON.

FEEDBACK from Tory:
Thanks for all of your hard work on this project Marika! I really appreciate your dedication and ability to stay positive and maintain a sense of humor no matter what. I think we both are still learning Git/Github and were hesitant to fully trust and utilize them, which held us back a little bit. All in all I really enjoyed working with you and I am proud of how far we got in this project.

#### (2DoBoxPivot)

Pairs were given another team's code from IdeaBox and asked to refactor and add features.

FEEDBACK from LeeLee:
Appreciations & Coaching:  Miss Marika Ross was very focused and diligent as a partner.  We had a very enjoyable time pairing together on 2DoBox.  She is a WHIZ at git, github, typing, and jQuery. She is also an excellent communicator.  We stuck to our DTR, paired often, and were committed to honoring our time together to meet common goals. She was open and honest about her prior pitfalls with pairing and was intentional about acknowledging and overcoming those during our pairing. We lucked out having already discussed issues of extrovert/introvert issues in our group during PD, so we knew how one another liked communication going into this pairing, which allowed for self-reflection and self-correction of issues that would inevitably arise as a result of these differences. 

 When confused by the logic, Marika feels far too comfortable with copying directly from old code from prior projects, or using found code that she doesn't fully understand.  After a specific 'code-win' using the :contains() psuedo-class method, Marika was feeling very confident about her use of found code. When moving forward to a different functionality in the code, she wanted to continue finding random code online. When I explained that this I had a specific functionality in mind that would be easier, using a method from Number Guesser, she had a moment where she didn't want to follow my lead and would rather use this randomly found code that she didn't understand.  Then something cool happened, ....She self-corrected.  She stopped what she was doing, looked me in my eyes and said "I will follow you now."  IT WAS COOL AS FUCK!  She is a rockstar in the making, and seems ready for any challenge, internally and externally.  Bravo on the intentional improvements you've made in your quest to become a badass developer, and human being.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)
#### Mental Health 101 
* [Mental Health 101](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)
Even though Turing is a stressful, intense environment it is important to take time to ensure your physical and mental health.  Putting in the most hours does not necessarily equal success.  Find what works for you and make it a priority whether it's exercising, meditating, or something else. 

#### Working Styles 
* [Working Styles](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)
It turns out I am an extrovert.  I didn't think that I fell into that category, but apparently I do and that means that I need to take a few things into consideration when I work with people who do not share this trait.  Specifically, not talking all the time and making sure to check in with the energy around me before I dive into something. 

#### Debugging the Gender Gap 
* [Debugging the Gender Gap](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)
I didn't realize the gender gap in tech was so large.  My previous work experience had been female dominated and I never thought twice about that.  Creating an inclusive environment means that people from all backgrounds need to make a conscious effort to create a culture of acceptance and inclusion. I think GearUps are a good example of that: not necessarily a mobilizing movement, but constant discussion about issues that need examining.

#### Tech in Medicine
This was an interesting discussion on how tech can improve the world of healthcare and medicine.  Most of the issues that were talked about in the TED talk and the discussion were symptoms of a privitized healthcare system, except for the preventative healthcare trackers.  I think it also would have been relevant to discuss medical records, privacy, and how we can use large data sets from specific populations ethically without compromising privacy.  Presenters mentioned a large data set from WHO regarding aenemia in the continent of Africa and I found myself thinking about what sort of a personal project I could do using a data set like that.  

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I have participated in SAB and really enjoyed being able to meet people from other Mods/programs and hear what their perspective's are on student issues.  I've also attended a few Joan Clark meetings when I don't have a pairing scheduled.
