## Areas of Emphasis

What was your learning focus this inning?

I wanted to learn and understand ES6 and establish a solid foundation for continuiing the learn React.

What technical and communication skills did you want to grow?

I wanted to be able to talk about code in a way the matches my ability to produce that code.
I understood that proper technical talk would make it easier to get assitance When needed. It's an ongoing challenge
that I contiue to work on.

Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?

I feel that have made goof strides this mod and at Turing in general. I know now that I am a programmer and will succeed.
As always there is so much more to learn and opportunities to grow.

## Self-Evaluation
_How do you feel you did in these areas this inning?_

I feel good about the mod although I am a little dissapointed in my ability to explain myself umder pressure.

* **C: Professional Skills**: 3
* **D: Community Participation**: 3
* **E: Final Assessment**: 3

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning.
Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)?

I thought the first 3 weeks of the mod were taxing but also very helpful. I certainly didn't get out of GameTime what I should have.

Even with that the combination of all the other projects, including the ones that were not required or graded, really helped
connect the dots. I feel that all the "things" combined vastly improved my areas of emphasis.

What was the most challenging?

Learning to be more comfortable in assesments continues to be challenging but gets better with practice.
I really enjoyed the whiteboard challenge and CompleteMe evals for that reason. 

What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning?

I plan to continue to work hard, be a positive part of the communitiy, help out where I can, and keep making small gaines
in my journey to finding a job. 

What do you plan to change?

To learn and understand more what the best approach is to handling difficult problems and situations. 

### Study Habits

What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one?

I would say that I was better about taking personal time this mod which really helped me learn more. I typically have a problem
of studying to much.

What stayed the same?

I still focused on trying to help others even if I didn't know the answer. This approach has continued to advance my learning and be comfortable reading and debugging others code.

Do your study habits serve you well?

They definately have, I don't find myself losing as much sleep or coming to class everyday with a sour stomach

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite?

The demo was nice but hard to turn into acutal code. I understand the importance of understanding the concepts.
It was good to struggle through and figure out the code.

What was challenging?

visualizing the concepts in code, console.log helped some with that.

for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)?

I really enjoyed weatherly and solidified OOP, imports, exports, State, Props, etc. I really enjoyed the project, it served me well.

How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?

React is very powerful and intuitive and I believe that it will only make me stronger when it comes to learning other languages.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 
* **Testing:** 
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 
* **Functional Expectations:** 
* **Code Sanitation:** 

What did you enjoy about Complete Me?

Understanding visually and conceptually how the binary-trie works.

How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)?

It was something that I expected so it was inculded but it definately serves a purpose.

How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?

I think it was another exercise that makes me a better problem solver in general.

## B: Group Work & Projects

Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning.
Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging?

As always partnering can be a challenge, people can be at different stress levels and cope in different ways.

What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning?

I will continue to be a solid, deicated, team player.

What do you plan to change?

I plan to continue working building better outcomes when diffictulties rise in partnerships.

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Kevin Krom
* **Game:** Centipede
* **Functional Expectations:** 
* **User Interface:** 
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 
* **JS Style:** 
* **Workflow:** 

What did you enjoy about GameTime?

Finishing the project!

What was challenging?

Canvas, requestAnimationFrame, and collision detection with mulitple loops.

What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)?

I would say the biggest understanding I gained was that of nested loops. I dont think it served much other than making
me better at pushing through and completing something regardless of the struggles.

How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?

Again it made me a better code warrioir. 

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** Lee Graham
* **Spec Adherence:** 
* **User Interface:** 
* **HTML Style:** 
* **CSS/Sass Style:** 
* **JS/React Style:** 
* **Testing:** 
* **Workflow:** 
* **Code Sanitation:** 

What did you enjoy about Weathrly?

Everything about the project was helpful.

What was challenging?

Testing is the most challenging and where the most room for improvement lies.

What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)?

React
How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?

OOP, import, export, State, Props, data cleaning, API calls, etc...

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * _List here_
  Agile Practices
  Feedback Conversations
  Outreach and Networking
  Professional Storytelling

_What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising?
  I'm continually getting better at feedback.

What skills did you hone?
 I improved my professional storytelling skills and started cold outreach.

Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?

PD sessions are always good because soft skills are something harder to learn and aquire. I feel that you have to be 
willing to be vulnerable to grow in these areas. Being vulnerable is something that I have pushed myself to do
even though it can be extremely uncomfortable at times.

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * _List here_
  
  Johari Window
  Teamwork and Strengths

What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising?

 Johari window was interesting but would have been more effective with more students adding input. 
 
Do you find it important to have conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions?

  Converstaions like these are always beneficial, you get to hear other perspectives.
  
Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future? in your workplace?
with your teammates?

Certainly. I enjoy talking to others and being open about my struggles and successes.

## Community Participation

Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing?

I put myself out there for a community lighting talk, I was extremely nervous but felt like it was something 
that I needed to push myself to do and will do again in the future.

in Denver?

I have done cold outreach with remote developes in the community through Denver Devs. I have not found opportunity
to participate in other activites at this time. 

Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable?
Illuminating?

I always enjoy helping others any chance I get. I enjoy it, it makes me a better person and progammer.

## Final Assessment

What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission weeek?

React and array prototypes!

What are you looking forward to about next inning?

Redux (if it's still needed in React) and Router.

What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?

I konw from last break that one week is too long to relax after studying intensely for 6 weeks. I will write a small amount
of code for one hour everyday.

# Outcome:
_Leave blank for instructors_
