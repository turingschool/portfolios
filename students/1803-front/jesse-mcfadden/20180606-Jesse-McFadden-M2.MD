## Areas of Emphasis

_What was your learning focus this inning? What technical and communication skills did you want to grow? Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?_

In this mod my focus was to put all of my energy into fully understanding the lessons and learning to apply my understanding in an efficient way. I wanted to gain the ability to communicate complex technical concepts in an articulate and effective way. In both of these pursuits I feel that I was able to put the appropriate attention and time in, but unable to get the desired output. 

## Self-Evaluation
_How do you feel you did in these areas this inning?_

* **A: Individual Work & Projects**: _3_
* **B: Group Work & Projects**: _4_
* **C: Professional Skills**: _5_
* **D: Community Participation**: _4_
* **E: Final Assessment**: _1_

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

Working through complete me gave me an understanding of how individual abilities as a programmer. They showed me that I needed to focus more energy on understanding how complex functions operate. 

### Study Habits

_What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same? Do your study habits serve you well?_

This inning I actively focused on removing any outside distractions that took away from my ability to be successful at Turing while maintaining positive routines that helped me stay sane. I was successful at this and feel that despite the outcome. Moving forward, I would like to focus repeatable actions where I can see visible results as I move forward.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** _Pass/Fail_

_What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Sorting suite was interesting because I was able to get a deeper understanding of the algorithmic thinking behind the methods and functions we use. It was also good to get a base understanding of the types of cs questions that might be present on a technical interview.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** _3_
* **Testing:** _2_
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** _3_
* **Functional Expectations:** _5_
* **Code Sanitation:** _3_

_What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Complete me was interesting because it pushed me to understand how fundamental algorithms can be built in code and applied to a live project. 

## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

Group projects helped solidify my understanding of concepts that I was unclear by putting them into practice. It also helped to see how other people would tackle a similar problem from a different angle.

### GameTime
* **Partner:** _Haley Jacobs_
* **Game:** _Frogger_
* **Functional Expectations:** _3_
* **User Interface:** _3_
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** _3_
* **JS Style:** _2_
* **Workflow:** _3_

_What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

In many ways Gametime was one of the most challenging projects I had done. It incorporated OOP and HTML5 Canvas(both new concepts) and required me to stretch my understanding of Javascript. 

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** _Tory Dannanberg_
* **Spec Adherence:** _NA_
* **User Interface:** _NA_
* **HTML Style:** _NA_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _NA_
* **JS/React Style:** _NA_
* **Testing:** _NA_
* **Workflow:** _NA_
* **Code Sanitation:** _NA_

_What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Weathrly was probably the most enjoyable project of the mod. It require both Tory and I to stretch and grow by incorporating a new framework as well as API fetch calls. I was also surprised by how much I enjoyed using CSS again…very surprised. 

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
Agile Practices & Leadership
Feedback II
Feedback III
Storytelling II
Outreach & Networking

_What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?_

Receiving feedback from my previous group partners was incredibly eye opening and confidence building.

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
Public Data

_What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising? Do you find it important to have conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions? Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future? in your workplace? with your teammates?_k 

Learning how other people perceived me was really surprising - especially people who I’ve worked with on a project closely. The tools to provide feedback to people are also incredibly valuable and will make me a better teammate moving forward.

## Community Participation

_Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing? in Denver? Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable? Illuminating?_

I feel like my community engagement was a key part of feeling successful at turing this mod. We all struggle with things and if we deal with that in isolation we often feel like we are the only ones. By setting up study sessions with my peers I have worked through many of the concepts that I was having difficulties with.

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission week? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?_

I plan on hitting react as hard as I can to have a leg up when mod 3 starts. Seeing as I am repeating, I am looking forward to solidifying my understanding of javascript and react fundamentals.
