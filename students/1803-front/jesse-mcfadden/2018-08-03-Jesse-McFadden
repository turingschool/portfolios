## Jesse McFadden - (M2) Portfolio
### Areas of Emphasis
I set out to gain an understanding of the JS fundamentals I was lacking my first time through mod 2. I focused on the foundations that I may have been soft on when I was in mod 1, through my first time in mod 2. I did this by doing exercises outside of the turing curriculum(Free Code Camp, Front-end Masters, Udemy Front-end Program). I also made a serious effort to pair with as many people as I could on array prototype methods - my main area of weakness. Although nerves are still an issue, I've gotten much more comfortable being in the 'hot seat' and resetting to find my path. In the end, I feel that the work I put into this mod has paid off. I feel my fundamental understanding and application of JS has increased dramatically and I feel fully prepared to move on to Mod 3.

Comments:

Good job with whiteboarding insert and talking through the process. Easy to follow along.
Unable to delete/re-implement the suggest method fully. Too attached to the code/patterns implemented on actual project which caused issues with trying to implement method live, despite prompting and guidance.

Fundamental JS & Style: 3
Test-Driven Development & Code Santiation: 3
Functional Expectations: 4

This project was really rewarding. Due to health issues, my partner was not available for the majority of hte project which forced me to really focus on some of the fundamental aspects of the project I had been shakey on the first ime through.

I truely feel that this is the first project I proud of during my time at Turing.
