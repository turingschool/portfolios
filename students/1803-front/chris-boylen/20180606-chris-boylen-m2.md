## Areas of Emphasis

My goal this module was to improve my solving problem process, learn react and improve my communication skills.  I focused on improving talking my way through code using the proper vocabulary.  I feel as though I have improved in all these areas.  My proplem solving process is getting better and I'm relying on tactics such as taking breaks, asking for help, and breaking things down into smaller problems.  I feel like I've gotten a basic introduction into react and look forward to imporving my knowledge in this area. I also feel as though my ability to communicate has improved.

## A: Individual Work & Projects

I feel that the individual projects this module helped me improve the goals that I had set for myself.  Due to the fact that the projects were more difficult and contained more pieces, I had to break these problems down into smaller identifiable problems, so they were easier to test and complete. I plan to continue this moving forward.

The most challenging for me was sorting suite.  It required understand how each sorting method worked, breaking it down into smaller pieces, and logically thinking my way to a solution. 

Moving forward I plan to work on problems that I don't know and might show up on an interview.  I want to improve my process of talking through my problem solving process and learning to break through tough points easier.

### Study Habits

My study habits changed this module by allocating more time to review the concepts from the beginning and throughout the module.  I also reached out for help sooner when I didn't understand something.  I plan to continue this moving forward.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

What I enjoyed working on sorting suite was replicating a whiteboarding session that might be required on a future interview.  Working together helped me to improve my communication, collaboration process, and seeing other people's problem solving process. I look forward to improving these processes in the future.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 3
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 3
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **Code Sanitation:** 3

I enjoyed working on Complete Me by myself, so that I could better gauge my ability without a partner. It helped me to improve my understanding of a prefix trie.  This project helped me to break problems down into smaller peices, so that I could focus a little more specifically on one thing. This will help me moving forward when I encounter large complex problems.

## B: Group Work & Projects

My group work throughout the module strengthened my collaboration, communication, and problem solving skills.  I enjoyed all the partners that I had throughout the module and think that my group projects went well.  I plan to continue to strengthen my collaboration, communication, and problem solving skills moving forward.

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Aaram Mandel
* **Game:** Frogger
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **User Interface:** 3
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 3
* **JS Style:** 3
* **Workflow:** 3


With GameTime, I enjoyed making an actual game.  I also enjoy working on projects that have a visual output.  I also enjoyed learning canvas.  Working with Aaram strengthened my collaboration, communication, and problem solving skills.  I enjoyed collaborating on Gametime and working toward each partner's strengths.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** Jeremiah Stanley
* **Spec Adherence:** 3
* **User Interface:** 3
* **HTML Style:** 3
* **CSS/Sass Style:** 3
* **JS/React Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 3
* **Workflow:** 3
* **Code Sanitation:** 3

With Weathrly, I enjoyed learning react and testing react.  It was difficult at first, but through perseverance and help we were able to build a nice app and incorporate my completeme project into it.  I found it rewarding working with Jeremiah as a partner and thought we worked well together.  Moving forward, I plan to develop my react skills further and look forward to doing this.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  *Agile Practices & Leadership, Feedback II, Feedback III, Storytelling II, and Outreach & Networking

I learned how to better give and receive feedback, how to craft a better story, and how to more effectively network.  I liked the feedback sessions, because they enabled me to give more effective feedback. I also really liked the storytelling session.  I enabled me to craft a better professional story that ecompases who I am and what I want to do.

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * Empathy and privilege, Getting better at difficult things, and Biohacking.

I found that the empathy and privilege Gear up was really valuable.  Learning more about what privilege is, put it in a different light.  I feel these are essential discussions to have, especially when working collaboratively with others.

## Community Participation

In the community I tried to bring a positive experience with anyone that I interacted with.  I paired with students from mods above and below me and foud it to be valuable.  I also tried to support the students in my current cohort during difficult times.

## Final Assessment

Moving forward I plan to improve giving and receiving feedback, my communication process, and my problem solving process.  I also want to get better at react, testing and working more efficiently with others. Over intermission I plan to spend more time with my family, while still maintaining healthy eating, sleeping, exercising, and studying habits.
