# Kevin Krom - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

 I set out to create a solid foundation in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I came in without much understanding of software development and learned more than I ever thought possible. The biggest focus for me was getting away from my fixed mindset and pushing myself past what I was previously comfortable with. No matter what happens with moving on or not, I'm so freaking happy that I'm moving into a fixed mindset and learning things that I might not be inherently good at.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed



## B: Individual Work & Projects
<hr>
This has been one of the more rewarding and challenging experiences of my life. On every project, I found myself questioning whether or not I could actually do this and by the end of the project, I was doing it and understanding why things were working out. Number Guesser was a really solid intro to DOM manipulation and while it was overwhelming at the time, I look back and think, “why was that so hard!”. That same sentiment could be applied to every project. Going through 2DoBox was the turning point for me. Better late than never, I guess…

(Intro)
#### Number Guesser

* https://github.com/kevinkrom787/number-guessing-game-turing
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

Number guesser was an app that had users guess a number between 1-100 and directed them to get the right answer by displaying hints on the DOM.

Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.

#### Static Comp 1

* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html

* https://github.com/kevinkrom787/bt-comp-challenge-1

We had to build a website that consisted of two sections. One displayed a 8box grid/flexbox like structure and then an image that took up 40% of the page. Started to figure out grid on this project along with how to make websites more fun. 

#### Static Comp 2

* https://github.com/kevinkrom787/kk-comp-challenge-2
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html

We were asked to build a website that displayed a row of cards that would line up on the page. It needed to be responsive and mirror the look of the site in the req above. 

#### Static Comp 3 

* https://github.com/kevinkrom787/kk-comp-challenge-3
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html

This was by far the most challenging comp but also the most rewarding. You are asked to build a responsive website that consists of a number of sidebars, multiple sections, and an SVG section. It feels good to build things that people would legitimately pay for! This also taught me who important planning is when you're building a large site like this.

## C: Group Work & Projects
<hr>

### Projects

Working in groups was such an awesome way to pick up javascript/jQuery. Everyone is going to have different strengths and weaknesses and it gets you talking outloud on things that you're working through. It also helps you realize that you're not alone! Everybody struggles and that's okay. Just keep learning. 

#### Linked-List

* https://github.com/kevinkrom787/Linked-list
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

This project was designed to have the user utilize two input fields to store information in cards on the right side of the page. Ultimately, we were manipulating the DOM and toggling classes. 

Novice: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One.
Advanced Be: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two. // validations and responsiveness
Proficient: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

### scores
Comp & Design = Advanced Beginner
HTML = advnaced beginner
CSS = advanced beginner
JS/jQuery = advanged beginner
Git and Github = advanced beginner
Pairing = proficient 


### feedback
Had a very proactive approach to getting started and having a 'can-do' attitude. I believe we both could have been better at the DTR portion of the project.  The initial phase didn't set expectations for either party. We could have worked through some concepts more together than separating and coming back with solutions. However, I think we pulled it together despite different workstyles. We also should probably work in a slightly more private setting because there were a lot of distractions that caused focus to get splintered on multiple occasions. Overall, it worked out pretty well.


#### IdeaBox

* https://github.com/brianw11/IdeaBox
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

(evaluation scores)

Novice Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.

(feedback to me)
Leverage console.log more to confirm that data is what we expect it to be (took this to heart!)

Nice job talking through your code! Keep up with practicing
Would like to see more commits. Be sure to be concise but explicit so that you commit history tells a story.
Several feature bugs


## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Mental Health

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md

Mental health has impacted my family first hand so I've grown up aware of the issue. Love how much Turing school goes out of their way to prepare us beyond just having the technical skills. The biggest takeaways, speak up if there is something going on. Also, understand there are different types of stress and how to handle them. I've always struggled with anxiety and imposter syndrome and Turing makes it okay to talk about those issues openly.


(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

## Gear up
## code 2.0 

The biggest takeaway was that software development community consists of more than two gender roles. I've always considered myself welcoming and inclusive but I think what I learned in this is that you can always improve. Also, as people going into the software engineering community, it's our responsibility in positions of power (white males) to help make the workplace way more inclusive for everybody. Also learned a lot about how the first computers were built by women! 


## Health and Tech

The biggest obstacle in medTech are ethical ones. Like, is it cool to clone humans who are like 10ft tall and have zero genetic mistakes? yes, that’s sweet but where do you draw the line? We also discussed storing consciousness and my first question is how are we going to keep that database secure? Anytime we find ourselves tracking large groups of people, we seem to have a history of leaking that information into the hands of those who want to harm us (Experian, JP morgan, facebook, etc). My concern for the future of this industry is how do we keep the information private? 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

On a micro scale, I've told pretty much everyone that they should come to Turing because it's freaking great. I also do my best to tweet about things going on with my progressions here. I haven't done as much as I would like to regarding making a brand for myself outside of MOD 1 but I try to be a positive influence no matter where I am and what I'm working on. Now that I have a better handle on things, I'm excited to carry over into helping others learning this trade.
