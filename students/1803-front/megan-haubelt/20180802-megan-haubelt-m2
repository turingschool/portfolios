# Megan Haubelt - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I came into this mod wanting to improve my problem solving skills and implement a more consistent and methodical process when encountering a problem.  I needed to spend more time with array prototypes and get a lot more reps in especially when combining two different data sets. I also thought I had an area of opportunity to improve my articulation skills when explaining code.  I feel that I was able to improve all of these skills significantly throughout the course of the mod and my confidence as a developer was enhanced as a result.  I also wanted to improve my React and React testing skills.  This is something I am going to continue to work on over break before heading into mod3.  I feel that I have a solid foundation going into mod3.

## E: Community Participation
I helped organize the pairing schedule and participated in pairings for mod1 students.  I also tried to get Pahlka restarted 
with another Turing student but it ultimately didn't work out.  I tried to help classmates in our mod whenever I could. I plan to volunteer at the Turing booth at the Taste of Ethiopia event this weekend.
