## Areas of Emphasis

SLAY! By 'slay' I mean, nose to the grind stone.  Meaning, painting my face every morning.  No all nighters.  Attending Iron FE when possible. I wanted to continue to further the depths to which I understand JS and I was estatic about implementing caanvas and react as extensions of the JS lexicon.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I PASSED!!!  I REALLY need to work on my technical speak though.  Like, alot.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

There were only a couple of pair projects and a couple of solo projects.  I was very surprise and the scarcity of projects this mod, 4 projects total as compared to the hefty 9 projects that we had in mod 1.  The first two solo projects were to empasize use of sorting algorithms and binary search trees.  The later two group projects were for functional web applications using both newly introduced programs from this mod, canvas and react. 

#### Sorting Suit

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TwirlingGoddess/Sorting-Algorithms)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

This project was not graded, but assigned to get us more comfortable with navigating and implementing common sorting algorithms.  The algorithms assigned were Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Insertion Sort.  We were also challenged with implementing a testing sweet accompanying the sorting algorithms to check the functionality of their components.

#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TwirlingGoddess/Complete-Me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

In this project we were charged with the task of implementing a binary search tree that would leverage a complex data set of  words by traversing the Trie element letter by letter.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The following projects were paired projects to enforce learning surrounding Canvas and React as extensions of the Javascript lexicon.

#### GameTime

* [!GitHub URL](https://github.com/TwirlingGoddess/GameTime-Centipede)
* [Original Assignment!](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

We were charged to use our newly found skills to implement a weather app using Canvas.  This app would not yet use an api or  local storage.  We were also asked to accompany a testing suite for game without testing the canvas elements.

Feedback:
"Lee was really patient given my family obligations and schedule limitations.  He had a hard time meeting in the early mornings however, which was my prime time for school. He pretty much carried me through this project, however, as I felt completely lost. Lee sat with me through every piece of code that we subsequently implemented into this project."
  - Megan Haubelt

#### Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TwirlingGoddess/WEATHRLY)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

We were charged to use our newly found skills to implement a weather app using React.  This app would take in a data set from an api and would use local storage.  We were also asked to accompany a testing suite for each React Component.  We also implemented the Trie component from the previous Complete Me project for autocomplete functionality in the Search component.

None. My partner, Gavin Love, was grossly uncommunicative.


## D: Professional Skills
Turing's mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. Our vision is a world powered by technology where the people building it represent the people using it. We're here to build a movement.

In order to advance this mission and vision, our curriculum transcends technical training. We also present students with opportunities to grow as individuals, members of a team, and members of a community.

Gear Up provides a forum for students to develop self-awareness, interpersonal skills, and gain awareness of the issues preventing tech from being an inclusive space.

Curriculum spans 4 modules
Each module includes 3 Gear Up sessions
Sessions are targeted at developing personal awareness in Mod 1. Mod 2 and 3 are focused on the interpersonal relationships and how to navigate personal privlege and power. 

### Gear Up
#### (Week 1: Empathy, Week 3: Rotation session, combined with Mod 3, Week 5: Choice Session, Mod 4 facilitated)

Reflection Questions
Once finished reviewing the list, write in your notebook on these questions.
* What were some factors that you have never thought of before?  I never really thought much about how, as a flamboyantly queer person of color, I don’t feel safe being visible by day; but I do feel safe being alone by night because of my size and the imagery associated with being a person of my stature. There are so many cis people who feel just the opposite on a daily basis.  Only feeling comfortable enough to walk publicly when there is light out.
* What statement made you think most? If you could add a statement, what would it be?  “Being able to show affection to your partner in public without fear of retaliation or violence.”  I just realized how uncommon it is for myself to feel comfortable showing affection to my loved ones in public spaces, but how often I see others displaying so very regularly.  It’s not something that I know that I might want, because it continues to simply feel disallowed, although I’m a grown ass human who can do whatever I want. 
* Select one of the statements that describes a seeming disadvantage that you would feel comfortable discussing.  I was always great at sports, often being the fastest at all try-outs, but the dynamic of exclusion from the others in the sport-of-choice that I’d participate in made me quit sports, when my other family members went on to become among the top players in the country.
    * What did that/those experience(s) feel like? Shitty.
    * If you were trying to describe that experience to someone else, what would that person need to do to help you continue to feel connected/trusting of them, even if they didn't share the experience?  I’m not sure.
* Select one of the statements that describes a seeming advantage/privilege that you would feel comfortable discussing.  Reaching the overhead bins on airplanes, while shorter or elderly people are forced to rely on complete strangers to lift and adjust their luggage for them.
    * What did that/those experience(s) feel like?
    * If you were trying to describe that experience to someone else who hadn't shared that experience with you, how would that affect your trust with them? What could that person do to help you sustain trust? What could you do?

* What are you taking away from this session? That dialogue in general is what is necessary to create change.  Speech, in writing, in song, in conversation, is a transference of energy.  Energy has to be passed, and can be stored, but we are not energy storing machines, otherwise, we’d never die.  We must keep our conversations flowing in order for true enlightenment.  Class shouldn’t end once you’ve got the job. 
* What perspectives did you hear today that make you think differently or challenged you?  It is easy to assume that the lives of those around you have not been met with difficulty, particularly when they put on that daily good-toothed smile.  When we finally reach a point of self-actualization though, we discover that more is going on outside of ourselves than to/within ourselves, and an awareness of those external happenings can help us better navigate the internal happenings through observation and self-exploration.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I really enjoyed helping to facilitate the try turing coding classes and panel conversations that are great opportunities to extend the community of Turing, and developers at large.
