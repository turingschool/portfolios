# Keeliana Marler - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In repeating module 1, I wanted to fully solidify my html, css, and javascript skills. I also wanted to solidify good habits to build upon for the coming modules and also fully understand the git workflow and master pairing skills.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual project was fun because it truly was your own project. Anything that worked was because of me, and anything that didn't work was something that I could improve upon. I also enjoy working alone at times, and throughly enjoyed spending my times on number guesser and the static comps. Number guesser was enjoyable at first due to its simplicity, but it was also cool that the level of difficulty gradually rose. Static comps 1 and 2 did not take too much time, and were fairly simple as far as layout and styling. Static comp 3 was a very involved and more complex project, so I was sure to start early on it so that I had the time to add responsiveness, appropriate styling, and accessibility.

Number Guesser

Number guesser is an application that allows a user to pick a minimum value, maximum value, and guess. The guess must be between the minimum and maximum values. The application then calculates a random number, then compares that number with the number provided by the user.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

There were three paired projects, each one getting more and more complicated.

Linked List

https://github.com/kmarler2/linked-list
http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

The linked list project was mostly an exercise in DOM manipulation. We gathered information from inputs, then added that information to a list.

The one thing that I really could've worked on with this project is refactoring html and css.

Idea Box

https://github.com/kmarler2/idea-box-1
http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

The Idea box project involved taking input from a user and adding that to a list.

I would've liked to get through more phases in this project. I would say that starting javascript earlier would've been helpful.

2DoBoxPivot

https://github.com/kmarler2/ToDoBox-Pivot
http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html

The ToDoBox project was a spin on the Idea Box project. It involved using code from other student's idea box project and refactoring it, and then pivoting it to a new kind of application.

I could've worked on better understanding when we needed to pass in values to functions. I understand it in its present state, but struggled with knowing when and what to pass in at the time that we were building the project.

## D: Professional Skills

This mod we learned the basics of self care, and laying out a lifestyle that is compatible with turing.

### Gear Up
#### Mental Health 101

https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up

This gearup session involved mostly dealing with stress. It is very important to keep yourself not only healthy physically but also mentally. I have gotten more exercise, and taken more time for myself to deal with stress.

#### Working Styles

https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up

This gearup session involved knowing yourself as well as others. It is important to be able to work with many different types of people from different viewpoints. Knowing myself, I typically prefer to work alone, but at Turing I've also learned so much from working with others that I now see it as very useful. 

#### Code debugging the gender gap

https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up

This gearup educated us on the current makeup of the coding community. Currently there is a huge gender gap. It is important to encourage girls to get involved math and science from a young age. 

#### Finding meaningful common ground

https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up

This gearup involved finding things in common with people you would not otherwise talk to. It gave us a variety of methods and ideas to connect with people. We also practiced those methods.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I helped a lot of people with mod 1 on various projects, met with Turing study groups on the weekends, and was involved in the turing community as a whole.
