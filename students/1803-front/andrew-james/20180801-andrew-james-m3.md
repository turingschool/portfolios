## Areas of Emphasis
My goals for this mod were to strengthen my React fundamentals, gain a working knowledge of Redux, improve on using TDD - especially testing async JavaScript. I feel that I accomplished my goals and feel I have a better understanding of testing.

## B: Individual Work & Projects
This module was a nice pace and I enjoyed the freedom to have work time more as the mod went on. I enjoyed the personal project this mod
and felt I had several ah-ha moments when creating my own application. I did struggle with what to build but once I had an idea in place
it was nice to bring the idea to life.
