From My partner Brian Tiedt
```
I just wanted to thank you for the chance to work with you. I'm sure as you move forward with future projects the structure, drive and work ethic you bring will foster your projects to success.  For me during the paring your experience was truly appreciated. I have a much better understanding for proper formatting practice, and Github work flow thanks to your standards. The proper structure and layout that really helps when looking at things and making adjustments. Continue to listen and have patience with your fellow humans and I have no doubt success will follow. Thank you, Brian Tiedt

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/andrew-t-james/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

**Functional Expectations**
* Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

**HTML**
Accessibility
* Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

**Style**
* Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

**CSS**
Structure of Code
* Exceptional Understands the performance implications surrounding cascading/specificity and crafts CSS that is mindful of reducing complexity and increasing performance.

**Implementation**
* Exceptional Can articulate rationale for all parts of the CSS implementation (each line of code/CSS rule) specifically in regards to the balance of: structure of code, design integrity, performance.

**Conditional Logic**
* Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.

**Functions & Scope**
* Exceptional Comfortable with using callback functions where applicable. Comfortable returning collections from functions (objects, arrays).

**Arrays**
Use .find when finding card with the same id

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

**Objects & Prototypes**
* Try to add a prototype function to generate the idea html

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

**DOM Manipulation**
* Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

**Style**
* Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

**Git**
* Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

**Github**
* Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.


**Comp Recreation**
* Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

**Collaboration**
* Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

**TERMINOLOGY**
**Technical Vocab**
* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary

From my Partner Laura Miller

```
I am so glad we were partnered for this project! I really appreciated your level of understanding with vanilla javascript and found a lot of value in our conversations about learning, being regimented, and your dedication to learning this skill.  Being a little intimidated by vanilla js, I wish our schedules would have allowed for more onsite, paired coding, but in return, I got more of a real world experience with splitting tasks, working through the Git workflow, and meeting in person to recap. I know that exposure to a more realistic setting will only help with future projects.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/andrew-t-james/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

**Notes/What To Work On:**
* Good constructor function name - love that your separating the data from the markup, could be more specific ie. task
* Pull shared css blocks into more broad class rules
* Think about leveraging one function to combine functions that look identical - ie. editTask
* Work on js naming conventions - make sure to give collections plural names
* Select on classes in event listeners instead of elements themselves

From my partner Tory Dannenberg

```
Thanks for your hard work on this project! I really enjoyed working with you and definitely learned a lot on this project. Your knowledge of coding is incredible and inspired me to push myself. It was a much different workflow than I have used in my other projects and I really enjoyed it. It gave me a lot of git/github practice and I liked having the features broken down so we always had ownership of something and were constantly making progress. If you had more availability in the evenings it would have been a perfect pairing. All in all I am extremely happy with how this project turned out and as David said in our eval, we "knocked it out of the park."

## D: Professional Skills

During this module we concentrated on the topics of stress management, the gender gap in tech, and incorporating techniques to meet and introducing your self to new people.

### Mental Health 101
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

 * This week attended our first gearup session. We spoke about Distress, Eustress, Acute Stress, Eposodic Acute Stress, Chronic Stress, Traumatic Stress, ways to measure stress, and stress management techniques. The stress techniques maybe could have played a bigger part in my personal life outside of Turing and will be something I focus on next mod.


### Code Debugging The Gender Gap
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

* This weeks gearup session spoke about the gender gap within tech. I was a bit surprised to see how big the gender gap within tech is upon attending the gearup and viewing the movie clips. I found the part about the airbags and the team who initially developed them very shocking. It does make sense that if we don't include everyone we miss out on many points of view.

### Finding Meaningful Common Ground

* We attended a student led gearups this week. THe presentation was described many ways one can incorporate unique strategies to meet new people. I think using some of the recommendations/techniques in the future could be helpful in making connections with new unfamiliar people.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I supported my classmates the best I could by helping with git/github issues, and general html/css/javascript questions.
