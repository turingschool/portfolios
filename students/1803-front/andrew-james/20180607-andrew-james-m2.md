## Areas of Emphasis

_What was your learning focus this inning? What technical and communication skills did you want to grow?
Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?_

My learning focus this inning was to improve my knowledge of JavaScript, understand when to use state, and gain a better
understanding how props are passed to child components. I do feel that I have achieved these goals this inning. I hoped
to improve communication skills thorough paired projects. I feel I was able to maintain communication skills from mod-1
but not improve upon those skills in paired projects.

## Self-Evaluation

* **A: Individual Work & Projects**: 3

* **B: Group Work & Projects**: 3

* **C: Professional Skills**: 3

* **D: Community Participation**: 3

* **E: Final Assessment**: 3


-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis
(from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning?
What do you plan to change?_

I really enjoyed the projects this inning. I found them to be challenging and satisfying to complete. Complete-Me helped
clarify what a data structure is as how it can be implemented within an application. I plan on continuing the current
work flow as much as possible as it has been beneficial for me up to this point.

### Study Habits

_What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same?
Do your study habits serve you well?_

Study habits are identical to the first inning. I get up at 4am and start reviewing for the day and do any work I need
to complete for the day at this time as well. I find this to be an enjoyable work pattern for me.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:**
Pass

_What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your
work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your
overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I thought that this project was great to take away some of the misconceptions I may have about algorithms. I don't know
much about CS and algorithms can seem intimidating. This project helped clear up some of my confusion on this topic.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:**
* **Testing:**
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:**
* **Functional Expectations:**
* **Code Sanitation:**

_What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I really enjoyed Complete me as well. I found this to be a great exercise in problem solving. It was a challenging
project, and very satisfying to complete but even more so to see how this data structure could be implemented.
I enjoyed working with my partner Joel on Game-Time we found a good work flow and were able to complete the project.
Weathrly has by far been the most enjoyable project for me to date at Turing. I enjoy working with react and this
project helped to solidify how to drill props.

## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

The group project I worked on this inning was again enjoyable. Game-time proved to be a challenge in writhing
test prior to implementing solutions. My partner and I had nearly no functionality to our game the day prior to
evaluations, but because we had tested first we were able to move quickly and build out functionality in a couple of
hours based on the tests we had written.

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Joel O'Conner
* **Game:** Frogger
* **Functional Expectations:** 4
* **User Interface:** 3.5
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 4
* **JS Style:** 3
* **Workflow:** 3

_What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Learning about OOP, and testing was enjoyable for me during Game-Time. The most challenging part of Game-Time was
keeping my motivation up to build a game as I do not enjoy building them. The OOP and testing concepts will prove
beneficial during Turing and beyond.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** N/A
* **Spec Adherence:** 4
* **User Interface:** 4
* **HTML Style:** 4
* **CSS/Sass Style:** 4
* **JS/React Style:** 4
* **Testing:** 4
* **Workflow:** 4
* **Code Sanitation:** 4

_What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I gained a better understanding of how and when to implement stateful components, drill props, along with why why state
management such as Redux exist.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**

  Agile Practices & Leadership
  Feedback II
  Feedback III
  Storytelling II
  Outreach & Networking

_What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?_

I feel the extra one on one session was helpful in preparing me on how to implement a profession story. I struggle in
this area. I really do not enjoy speaking about myself. The Agile session was very helpful at clarifying what were once
buzz words for me. The johari window was a surprising exercise for me as I expected more feedback on attributes I feel
weak on. Outreach and networking proves to be a challenging for me as well. I have not lived in America in a few year
and have relatively little no contacts outside of my immediate family.

* **Gear Up Sessions:**

  Week 1: Empathy
  Week 3: Rotation session, combined with Mod 3
  Week 5: Choice Session, Mod 4 facilitated

_What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising? Do you find it important to have conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions? Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future? in your workplace? with your teammates?_

I think the empathy session was decent. I was able to share some about my passed and situations I have gone through.
I still find it very challenging to speak about myself and this was opportunity to push myself to share more. I found
this session challenging to participate in, and felt my group shared those same feelings. We all seemed hesitant to share.
The bio-hacking session I attended was interesting. I hadn't though of bio-hacking as more than a way of improving
health. The student led session brought several perspectives on "what" bio-hacking can be.


## Community Participation

_Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing? in Denver? Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable? Illuminating?_

I opted in to the community by working one on one with mod one students, and attending lunch sessions tutoring mod one students on mythical creatures. I did enjoy pairing and guiding mythical creature sessions.

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission week? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?_

I plan to continue to work on Algorithms and Data Structures over the break, and build out a small application using Redux, and testing the application so I have a working knowledge of the technology for the next inning. I also plan to go over basics after my final eval I found some weaknesses that I can focus on with array prototypes. No other plans other than programming over the break.
