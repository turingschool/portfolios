## A: End of Module Assessment
  I failed the end of module assessment.

-----------------------
## B: Individual Work & Projects
  * Swapi-box
  * Personal Project
  The individual projects we had this module were swapi-box and our personal project. These projects were great for how they improved my understanding of how important good data and using a good API can affect your project outcome.

#### Swapi-Box
  * [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/JoOCon/swapi-box-jo)
  * [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)
  utilizing the Swapi API https://swapi.co/ we made GET fetch requests and nested GET fetch requests. It was interesting to see how web data is stored in API and also how you can develop an opinion of an API based on how the information is structured. This was also a great test of my ability to use React and test React.

#### Retirement-Planner
  * [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/JoOCon/retirement-planner)
  * [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)
  I'm making a program that solves the problem of helping people plan for their retirement. During my career in finance I found that there was a lack of quality retirement planning software available for free. I plan to create a product that will have a smooth and comfortable user experience while going over the complexities of planning a person's financial future.

## C: Group Work & Projects
### Projects
  * Headcount2.0
  * MovieTracker
  The group projects were fun and they provided a great means for us to grow our knowledge rapidly while still having the immediate help of our partners. My knowledge of API utilization and how to implement large groups of data into a project grew immensely.

#### Headcount2.0
  * [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/JoOCon/headcount2.0)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)
  We used a large set of data that provided us with information on students in the Colorado k-12 school system. We took the data then cleaned it and organized it so that it would be presentable to a user. Also the user was able to compare info and search through the cards of data that were created.

#### MovieTracker
  * [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/JoOCon/movie-tracker-fe)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)
  MovieTracker was a project that utilized a backend where we made GET and POST fetch calls to. We also used the Movie Database API https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en to gather current movie data. The app allowed users to create an account and favorite movies they were interested in.

## D: Professional Skills
  * [My Turing Profile](https://www.turing.io/alumni/joel-oconnor)
### Gear Up
  * [Microaggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod3_Week1_Microaggressions_update.md)
  I think that this session was very helpful and brought up the importance of being aware of your impact on those around you. Microaggressions are something that truly can have a negative impact on a person and sometimes you might not even know you are doing it.
  * [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Rotation_Session_Tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
  Diversity in society is very important and this gear up highlighted that. I thought that the Parable of the Polygons game was good at showing the impact on small changes in society and how they can effect diversity.
  * [Relax](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1806-inning/relax.md)
  This session was awesome! I really liked how the students from mod 4 put the emphasis on mindfulness and being aware of how you effect others but also how to keep yourself mentally happy. With all the stress in life this was a perfect escape and something I think Turing should have on a weekly basis.

## E: Community Participation
### Playing a Part
  I supported the community by pairing with students in mod 2 and also by being a part of SAB.
