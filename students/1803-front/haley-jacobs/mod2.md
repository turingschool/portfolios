# Haley Jacobs - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Becoming comfortable with array prototypes and new features of JavaScript ES6 such as arrow functions and inheritance. Understanding scope and which variable declarations (var, let, & const) can be used in each scope and the difference between them. Inheritance with parent and child classes.

## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hljacobs5/complete-mee)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

In this project we coded a Binary Search Trie with insert, suggest, count, and delete method.

Comments:
Articulation could use improvement; however, was able to logically talk through insert on the whiteboard
Unable to delete/re-implement the suggest method fully. Too attached to the code/patterns implemented on actual project which caused issues with trying to implement method live, despite prompting and guidance.

 Scores:
 Process: 2 - Developer does not articulate thought process clearly, and cannot explain the problem-solving strategies they utilized.

 Fundamental JavaScript & Style: 3 - Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

 Test-Driven Development & Code Sanitation: 2.5 - Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient. Linting shows more than ten complaints.
No commented out code/tests should be living on your master branch. Lots of console logs and empty it blocks for incomplete testing
ESLint shows 45 problems (17 errors, 28 warnings)

Functional Expectations: 4 - Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

Delete implemented with testing

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### GameTime: Tron

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hljacobs5/dm-hj-gametime)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

In this project we built the video game Tron using Canvas and JavaScript ES6.

Comments: 
- Limited functionality (no score, does not get more difficult, refresh page to restart game, game starts immediately on page load)
- Since this game is tron, it does not make sense to name things as snakes
- 'snake' collision should not happen in the trail collision
- snake.trail.push should be in snake file or gamepiece file, along with other things

Scores:
Functional Expectations: 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
User Interface: 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
Testing: 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.
JavaScript Style & OOP: 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.
Workflow: 2 - The developer/team makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application. The team does not utilize a planning tool or equitable pairing practices. One or both members do not contribute meaningfully to the application.

#### Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelyons/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

In this project we were introduced to React and fetching live data from an API through creating a weather application.
