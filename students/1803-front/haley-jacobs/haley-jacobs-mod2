-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

I think the individual projects helped me focus on the skills that I was not strong in because there was no partner to help with. It was challenging in that way and also forced me to open up and ask for help from people when I needed to. 

### Study Habits

I started staying at Turing later in the day because I have found I study much better at Turing. I need to improve my study habits when I am at home and learn how to focus when distracting things are happening around me. 

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

The Sorting Suite project was like a puzzle with code. It was good intellectual stimulation, but very challenging. It involves a lot of critical thinking.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** _0 - 4_
* **Testing:** _0 - 4_
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** _0 - 4_
* **Functional Expectations:** _0 - 4_
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_

_What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Complete Me was very challenging. It was good to get a taste of the backend style coding though, and also very interesting once you understood how it worked. 

## B: Group Work & Projects

I enjoyed the group projects that I had, it is good to work with people who are at your skill level. Coordinating schedules was a challenge at times. My partner and I really tried hard to do most of our project together so that we both learned and understood the code well. 

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Jesse McFadden
* **Game:** Frogger
* **Functional Expectations:** _0 - 4_
* **User Interface:** _0 - 4_
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_
* **JS Style:** _0 - 4_
* **Workflow:** _0 - 4_

Using canvas was very challenging, however I learned how to refactor and dry up code very well using new ES6 terms. 

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** None
* **Spec Adherence:** _0 - 4_
* **User Interface:** _0 - 4_
* **HTML Style:** _0 - 4_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _0 - 4_
* **JS/React Style:** _0 - 4_
* **Testing:** _0 - 4_
* **Workflow:** _0 - 4_
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_

Weathrly was a great introduction to using React and using live data from an API. 

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * Agile practices and leadership
    Feedback 2
    Feedback 3
    Storytelling 2
    Outreach and networking

The cold out reach idea suprised me because I have been told to not reach out to people who do not have mutual connections. I haven't tried it yet, but it was an interesting thing to suggest. I could see it potentially being helpful in networking and finding a job, it's just an interesting way to network. 

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * Empathy and Privelige
    Getting better at different things
    Mental Health

During my Gear Up session with mod 4 about mental health I learned that many students struggle with the same feelings of anxiety and depression that I have. They showed us 8 apps we could use on our phones to help us with anxiety. 

## Community Participation

Cleaned the dishes in the sink :)

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission weeek? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?_
I plan to strengthen my array prototypes skills an testing react/JS.
