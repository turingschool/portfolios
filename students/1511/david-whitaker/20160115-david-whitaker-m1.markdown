# David Whitaker: Module 1
___
## Individual

### Your Mission

After working in various facets of organic food production, I've found that there are many improvements that need implemented for most small food growers and manufacturers.  I'd like to eventually use my technical skills to improve traceability and ultimately make life easier for small companies such as the ones that I've worked for.

My goal for module one was to dive in to the Turing culture and get a solid base/toolkit for my future in programming.  Through countless hours of hard work, help from generous mentors and and fellow students I feel as though I have achieved this goal.  I also feel that in the process I've learned a new way to think.  This module has taught me how to take an "impossible" problem and break it down into a series of smaller more tangible steps.

#### Headcount

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/ksk5280/headcount)
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/tree/master/source/projects/headcount)

Assessed By: **Mary Cutrali**

##### Project Description:
Build an app to analyze a dataset centered around schools in Colorado provided by the Annie E. Casey foundation.

Learning Goals:
Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
Decompose a large application into components such as parsers, repositories, and analysis tools
Use test fixtures instead of actual data when testing
Connect related objects together through references
Learn an agile approach to building software

##### Evaluation Comments:
dynamically load CSVs
great use of enumerables & ruby data structures
good test coverage w/ pretty good performance (< 10 hits/line!!!)
documentation in tests!!!!
small classes w/ single responsibilities
evidence of refactoring
small tests with clear expectations ## Evaluation Rubric

##### Reflection:
- The thing that I have enjoyed most about this project is sending and tracing objects throughout so many different classes, files and methods.  It has been particularly interesting to see these interactions as all of the other projects have been pretty small by comparison.

##### Scores:

- Functional Expectations: 3
- Test-Driven Development: 4
- Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 4
- Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
- Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring : 4
- Enumerable & Collections: 4



#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/GKhalsa/http_yeah_you_know_me)  
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

Assessed By: **Lovisa batman-superman**

##### Project Description:
Introduce HTTP, the protocol that runs the web, and build a functioning web server to put that understanding into action.

**Learning Goals:**
- Practice breaking a workflow into a system of coordinating components
- Practice using TDD at the unit, integration, and acceptance levels
- Understand how the HTTP request/response cycle works
- Practice implementing basic HTTP requests and responses

##### Evaluation Comments:
- developers tested part of the server but tests do not cover all cases or features

##### Reflection:
- Sunny and I were both sick during this project.  The brain fog was strong at times and we often stayed up longer than we probably should have.  Despite the poor scores I feel as though I learned a lot during this project.  We initially went with a nearly identical server from the 'experiment' and later decided to build one from scratch.  Josh Cheek's waypoint on HTTP was essential in doing this.  Spent a ton of time refactoring to little or no avail until in our assessment where Lovisa gave amazing feedback.

##### Scores:

* Functionality: 2
* Ruby Style: 3
* Testing: 2
* Breaking Logic into Components: 2

#### Enigma

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/damwhit/enigma)  
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Assessed By: **Andrew Carmer**

##### Project Description:
Build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.

**Learning Goals:**
- Practice breaking a program into logical components
- Testing components in isolation and in combination
- Applying Enumerable techniques in a real context
- Reading text from and writing text to files

##### Evaluation Comments:
- Full functionality - Didn't need to input date for crack, but date was input within crack.rb - Acceptable.

##### Reflection:
- This was my favorite projects throughout the module.  I saw the imitation game a month or so before starting school and I really appreciated the opportunity to build an elementary version of the enigma machine.

##### Scores:
- Overall Functionality: 3
- Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
- TDD: 3
- Breaking Logic Into Components: 3.5

#### Jungle Beats

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/damwhit/jungle-beats)  
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Assessed By: **Andrew Carmer**

##### Project Description:
Make an application that can do some silly things with sound and linked lists. Basically a drum machine that's backed by a linked list.

**Learning Goals:**
- Practice breaking a program into logical components
- Distinguish between classes and instances of those classes
- Understand how linked lists work to store and find data
- Test components in isolation and in combination

##### Evaluation Comments:
- Overall really good project. I liked the work that I saw. Testing was really solid, but could have gotten to some sad paths. Some work on refactoring could be good to. Would like to see a focus on code quality/refactoring next time. Overall I was impressed.

##### Reflection:
- I really liked doing this project as I feel it accomplished its goal in allowing me to understand how linked lists work.  The sounds were pretty amusing as well.

##### Scores:
* Overall Functionality: 3
* Test Driven Development: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3

### Giving Feedback

>**Kimi Kano** "Kimi has been a pleasure to work on the final project with.  She is able to quickly pick up new ideas and is fun to work through problems with as she does very well at explaining her thought process and has a great sense of humor along the way.  She makes great use of pry and the terminal for debugging as well.  Kimi has great instincts and is at her programming best when she trusts those instincts."

>**Sunny Khalsa** "Sunny is one of the most genuine people that I have had the pleasure of meeting.  He would gladly give you the shirt off his back(or more likely share tea from his backpack- as he did for me while I was sick), because he genuinely cares.  His curiosity is contagious and makes you want to dive deep to gain full understanding of whats happening in every facet of a project.  This is an excellent attribute to have however it may slow down progress at times."

>**Brennan Holzclaw** "Brennan has been something of a cool, confident, calm and collected veteran for our cohort this module.  He does a wonderful job at explaining concepts and is patient when answering questions or helping with a problem.  I have really enjoyed pairing with him as we tend to work through problems quickly together and enjoy the process in doing so."

>**Adam Hundley** "Adam quickly grasps new ideas and is great to pair with because we have thorough discussions about different ways to solve a problem.  Even when away we are away from a computer, I think that Adam does a great job at clearly articulating a problem and his thought process on how to solve it.  I really enjoy bouncing ideas back and forth with him and applying those ideas to the problems weâ€™re working on in class."

### Being a Community Member

> "I've had a great experience working with David on the 10-day Headcount project. He has a very open communication style. We had a good DTR before the project and stayed in communication the whole week. We paired together almost 100% of the time and it worked really well. There was a lot of good give and take in working on this project together. We both learned a lot from the experience, from working with git to being more comfortable communicating between classes, etc. He's extremely positive and easy to work with. During the entirety of this project he's managed to stay optimistic and upbeat despite the stress of the high workload and long hours. I would be delighted to work with him again on future projects and I feel that he brings a lot to the Turing community."
**Kimi Kano**

>"I paired with David on the http yeah you know me project. All I can say is that if you get paired with him you should consider yourself lucky. He is a very talented programmer but also has such an ease about him that makes the stressful times seem almost non existent. I remember laughing with him while our project was seemingly having a midlife crisis. Thatâ€™s what a great pairing partner can do, itâ€™s so easy to get held up and feel frozen when things arenâ€™t going well, but he was totally unaffected and inspired us to move forward." **Sunny Khalsa**


> "David is a very easy guy to work with. He does a good job of listening to your whole idea or point, and then politely questioning anything he doesnâ€™t understand or disagrees with. We were able to understand each otherâ€™s workflow pretty easily, which meant we could work through problems fairly quickly." **Brennan Holzclaw**  

> "I had the opportunity to pair with David as we were doing our individual Enigma projects. His grasp of OOP early on was very apparent. We were able to sludge threw figuring out how to encrypt and working on Ruby basics together. Davidâ€™s ability to comprehend with ease was a comfort throughout the pairing process." **Adam Hundley**



### Playing a Part

One of my favorite things about Turing is how welcoming, patient, and understanding the people are.  I never feel intimidated or judged when I ask folks questions and I believe that I give people the same courtesy back.
Hanging out with folks from other cohorts has been very valuable for me and its definitely added to my sense of community as well.

Some things I have done throughout the module:

Made coffee 2 times throughout the module when it was empty
Put toilet paper in the bathroom twice when I noticed it had run out
Attended a kids who code showcase before winter break
Have gone out to lunch a few times with fellow students other than lunch roulette.  Horace joined us one time which was fun too
Helped Nick Dorans with dishes during cleanup last week after my duties were finished
Nate, Ali, Jhun and I cleaned up after the nacho bar our first week when our other posse members were nowhere to be found
Helped get burritos from Sekhar's car one Friday for breakfast

In the future I plan to attend improv every week and do the dishes at least two times a week.  I'm also interested in helping with social events if time allows.
