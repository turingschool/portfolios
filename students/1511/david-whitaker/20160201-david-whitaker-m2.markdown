# David Whitaker: Module 2
___
### Your Mission

After working in various facets of organic food production, I've found that there are many improvements that need implemented for most small food growers and manufacturers.  I'd like to eventually use my technical skills to improve traceability and ultimately make life easier for small companies such as the ones that I've worked for.

My goal for module two was to learn the basics of web programming in rails and to further immerse myself in the turing community.  I feel like in the process of creating a coffee e-commerce app and having gone through many tutorials I have a good understanding of creating web apps in rails.  

### End of Module Assessment

## Notes

* able to modify existing test to include new functionality
* comfortable building labels and text fields in forms
* knew when to create migration to modify table based on error messages

#### Rush Hour

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/damwhit/rush-hour-skeleton)  

Assessed By: **Andrew Carmer**

##### Project Description:
Creating a mini much more elementary version of google maps using sinatra.

##### Evaluation Comments:
Team: Hedy Woo & Heidi Hoopes & David Whitaker

Comments:
Think of more edge cases in testing.  
Assert page has dynamic content in feature tests.
Think of all possible user stories!!
User error, full messages dynamically.
Always test as many validations as there are for models.

Assessed By: Andrew

Notes:

Some mixing up responsibilities within tests. Controller test holds some model tests within.
Controller tests missing a little functionality. Try to test for each route (happy and sad)
Good use of test helper methods to construct data.
Model tests have some erroneous assertions, could be ramped up to be a little more robust.
Pay attention to names of tests.
Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.

6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

### Giving Feedback

>**Heidi Hoopes** "I had the pleasure of working with Heidi on a Sinatra based project called RushHour.  She is a very talented programmer who has a knack for zeroing in on problems and getting to the bottom of them.  I find her civic efforts at turing to be quite inspiring as well.  She has organized and hosted pairing/tutoring sessions with the new cohort while raising 3 children - I really don’t know how she does it.  My one piece of feedback is that she should take more breaks, as she can, admittedly, go down rabbit holes when trying to get to the bottom of something when it may be more beneficial at times to come up for air.  I hope that I get the opportunity to work on another project with her!"

>**Adam Hundley** "I had the opportunity to work with Adam on Little Owl.  He is a talented programmer who is able to grasp things very quickly and implement them almost seamlessly.  When presented with a problem he is able to stay cool(unless the internet shuts down multiple times when he is trying to use recordit lolol), in the moment and confident that he’ll get to the bottom of it.  His soft skill of googling things is actually quite impressive and I feel as though mine have improved after working with him.  His eagerness to learn new things and ability to apply those concepts is inspiring and hope to have the chance to work on another project with him."

>**Nick Weiland** "I had the chance to pair with Nick on Little Owl.  His vision from the beginning of the the project forward was truly inspiring.  When we sat down the first day Adam and I both were extremely impressed that he aspired to make a website for little owl coffee across the street.  His attention to detail in both design and code is brilliant as well as his ability to instill confidence in his teammates.  There were multiple points during the project where Nick would seek out new, interesting challenges with contagious enthusiasm.  I hope that some of that enthusiastic fearlessness has rubbed off on me.  I really hope to work with him again!"

>**July Tran** "It was really fun to work with July on our mini rails project.  I appreciated her extremely collaborative and laid back personality.  July has an amazing ability to look at a problem and take a moment to step back and think it through.  I find her community involvement to be very inspirational as well.  It's quite amazing that she started environmental variables and played a pivotal role in putting on two gear ups this module.  I would like to push July to taking on a side project as I think that she has some amazing ideas and it would be really cool to see what she comes up with."

### Being a Community Member

> "Working with David on our mini rails project was a real pleasure. He was an extremely collaborative partner to pair with, and his easygoing, jovial personality added to the enjoyment of pairing with him. I also really appreciate David's community involvement in environment_variables, a group focused on trying to reduce Turing's carbon impact. For future modules, I would challenge David to increase his involvement in the community and pick up a side project, as he is more than capable of achieving all these things."
**July Tran**

>"I worked with David on an ActiveRecord/Sinatra project simulating a delivery of website analytics. David is quick yet thorough in churning through creating database and website resources. While he was versed in the higher level technologies we were expected to use, and was resourceful and purposeful in research, some more native practice with simple HTML will give him context in implementing views. I would enjoy working with David again for his stress-free and competent development style." **Heidi Hoopes**


> "David and I have paired on homework many times but working on Little Shop together was our first time in a structured pairing situation. David's communication and passion for solving the problem is contagious. There is nothing like 2 grown men high fiving after getting a test to pass. Speaking of tests, he is a beast. Testing is a weaker point for me but David quickly filled that void for our team by writing model tests and constantly challenging us to TDD. I found that even when our team was working separately he would want to be brought up to speed with what was accomplished and learn whatever he could.  His tenacity for always learning is contagious and I hope to pair with him again. " **Adam Hundley**  

> "Working with Adam and David on Little Owl was an awesome experience because it was the first time I’ve worked on a projects where our workflow was like a functioning team rather than a pairing session. I was super impressed with David's skill from the beginning, especially with his ability to recall design patterns that I was still referencing past project or Rails docs to create. Although not a core objective of this program, it would be great to see David improve upon his front-end design over Mod 3 because he seemed to be really interested. I'd be stoked to work with him again. **Nick Weiland**

### Playing a Part

One of my favorite things about Turing is how welcoming, patient, and understanding the people are.  I never feel intimidated or judged when I ask folks questions and I believe that I give people the same courtesy back.
Hanging out with folks from other cohorts has been very valuable for me and its definitely added to my sense of community as well.

Some things I have done throughout the module:

Made coffee 10+ times throughout the module when it was empty.
Attended environmental variables 3 times throughout the module and intend to continue going for the rest of my time at Turing.  
Was a facilitator for the environmental variables gear up.
I taught a class on git flow for module one folks which was one of the most rewarding parts of the module for me.
I attended an improv session an definitely intend to go as often as I can in the future.

In the future I plan to attend improv every week and do the dishes at least two times a week.  I'm also interested in helping with social events if time allows.
