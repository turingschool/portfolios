## Nate Venn - M2 Portfolio

## Area of Emphasis
* I set out to gain a solid foundation in rails so that I could comfortably build
* a small web application. I wanted to have a better understanding of the structure
* of the internet and more specifically the client server model.


#### Rush Hour DTR
Goals:
* Julian-> Structure and management, Keep the project on schedule.
* Scott-> comfort with all new tools and understand the concepts.
* Nate-> be more comfortable driving, work on typing speed, comfort using all the tools, git work flow, and concepts
*
Roles:
* Julian-> lead
* Scott-> driver
* Nate-> driver

Comm:
* -slack
* -Screenhero
* -mostly in person
*
Strengths:
* Julian -> Conceptual understanding
* Scott-> typing, workflow, logical reasoning
* Nate-> soft skills, communication, work ethics

Weakness:
* Julian-> too quick to implement. Breaking down large problems
* Scott-> Full understanding of all pieces of the puzzle
* nate -> technical skills

features perferred:
* julian -> wants to work on databases
* scott-> all parts
* nate -> all parts

git workflow:
* clone down
* create branch
* work thru feature if test pass
* push
* make pull request
* fetch down changes
* merge to master

feedback:
* Julian -> Great management skills, strong understanding of the ruby, sinatra.
  Excellent workflow. Patient teacher.
* Scott -> Good understand of the technical skills. Strong typer. Should slow
  down and not rush through features. sometimes too many mistakes because he
  moves to fast. Very good at recognizing where others need improvement and
  takes the time and has the patients to help them identify and improve.
* Nate -> strong work ethic. self aware of his weaknesses and making a stratagy
  for impriving. Struggles to express himself especially when trying to convey
  his lack of understanding on a technical aspect.

#### Little Shop
feedback:
* Nick -> Great sense of humor. Easy to work with. Good understanding of ruby
  and rails. Identified where he wanted to improve and accomplished his goal. As
  the team leader he can work on over all communication with teammates and
  clearly defining goals and outcomes. It would also help if he did daily
  checkins to make sure everyone is up to date on the project.
* Chad -> Easy to work with. Hard worker. Chad can work on slowing down and reflecting on a
  problem when the pressure or stress of a project increases. Chad gets hasty
  and falls into tunnel vision at times. But he is excellent at problemsolving
  and he inspires his teammates with his excitement for learning.
* Nate -> Laid back and easy going. Good understanding of rails and works great
  in groups and independently. He needs to work on involving his teammate more
  with his on tasks. Might benefit with others perspectives.

### Peer Feedback
#### July Tran feedback to me:
* good job with introductions
* try to involve group in setting expectations
* good job thanking people for sharing
* good posing questions
* I think you did a great job facilitating, Nate! You guided the discussion while being super chill,
* in true nate-dawg fashion. There was some confusion about the format, but I get that there is a lot going on

#### Julian Feliciano
* To say that Nate has a strong work ethic would be a gross understatement. His
  drive to consistently push himself out of his comfort zone inspires us all to
  continually push ourselves. Along with being an exceptional teammate, he is
  always willing to listen and take notes on what he needs to improve on. I
  would ask Nate to continue working on his workflow, which over the past couple
  of modules has steadily improved. In conclusion, Nate is a everything a Turing
  student should and can be.

#### Chad Ellison
* I have paired with Nate on several occasions including our most recent project.
  Some of the things that make Nate a strong programmer are his drive and his ability
  to pick things up fast. He did his last several projects while learning Vim.
  He pursued some of the most difficult components of our app, and tackled them.
  Every time I pair with Nate, he is always encouraging and positive.
  Even when we are stuck on a bug, the energy he brings to a pairing session is
  never stressful, and  always cultivates an environment for learning.i
  Nate is also great to work with because he genuinely considers the input of
  his collaborators even when he already has his own solution to a problem.
  Continuing to get better at TDD (not that he is not good at TDD) will make
  Nate an even stronger programmer. I have no doubt that Nateâ€™s drive, technical ability,
  and ability to learn, will make him a great developer.

### feedback for others

#### To Julian
* I had the pleasure of working with Julian on Rush Hour.
 Other than being a talented programmer and developer he is also an natural project manager.
 He took the role of managing our project with comfort and ease. He demonstrated organization,
 vision, flexibility, and had a great attitude. What I was most impressed with was how he
 actively supported both Scott and I in achieving our personal goals for the project .

#### To Chad
* I have paired with Chad on numerous homework assignments and exercises and I was fortunate
 to have him as a teammate in Little Shop. Chad inspires me in many ways. First off he is the
 kindest and most polite person I know. In this regard he is just a pleasure to work with and be around.
 Chad also actively seeks out help when needed and encourages good collaboration  with his teammates.
 His enthusiasm and eagerness to learn and understand concepts is one of the main reasons I most enjoy
 pairing with him. I am a better programmer because of him.  I think Chad would really benefit in slowing
 down when times get tough and focus on the bigger picture. He is an excellent problem solver but one thing
 that I noticed is that when we hit a bug he would hastily dive into the code. Its definitely not a negative
 but I think it would help him solve the issue sooner if he approached it with eagle eyes compared to tunnel vision.
 To his credit he always seemed to fix the bug!

#### To Scott
* Good understand of the technical skills. Strong typer. Should slow
  down and not rush through features. Sometimes makes too many mistakes.
  Very good at recognizing where others need weaknesses and
  takes the time and has the patients to help them identify and improve.

### Group Projects

### Rush Hour
#### Team: Julian Feliciano & Scott Firestone & Nate Venn
**Assessed By:** Andrew Carmer
### Notes:

* Solid testing at unit, controller, and features levels. Small suggestions for model testing and feature testing.
* Solid functionality overall. Everything was there, no extentions.
* Would suggest to pay close attention to variable names. Be more explicit.
* small bits of logic sneaking into the views. No large calculations but something to be conscious of moving forward. Do not do this.

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests.

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

While you won't be graded on workflow for Rush Hour, here's an example of how you will be evaluated on workflow later in the module:

#### Workflow (NOT GRADED)

* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

### Evaluation notes
* make better commit messages. Find something wrong or potentially problematic and
  make on inline comment
* Take out the find method in the order show page and write a method inside your
  order model that finds the instance of that object and returns an array of
  those objects that you can iterate over inside the view.
* make helper methods for any formating of data.
* create a development branch that tests all merged branches before going to
  master. dont push to master until you have tested your development branch on
  your server and heroku.

#### Little Shop
**Assessed By:** Andrew Carmer

Notes:

* Logic in views, only a couple times but needs to be refactored
* Views also had a fair amount of conditionals
* Refactoring the DB design would have been very helpful

## Evaluation Process

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the
following criteria:

### 1. Feature Completeness

* 3: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented

### 2. Views

* 3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through

### 3. Controllers

* 3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts

### 4. Models

* 3: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring

### 5. Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

### 6. Usability

* 3: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready

### 7. Workflow

* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

### Playing a Part

I Have supported the larger Turing Community?

* Joined lunch roulette groups
* Participated in Turing outings
* Participated in the 1511 mentoring group
* Facilitated Gear Up discussion
* Went to an API intro class lead by Rachel Warbelow
