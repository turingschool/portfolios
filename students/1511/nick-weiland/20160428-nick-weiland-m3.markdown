# Nick Weiland - M1 Portfolio

### Defense

1. End-of-Module Assessment: N/A
 * Missed assessment due to family emergency.  Passed mid-module diagnostic.

2. Individual Work & Projects: 4
* Was able to push expectations on all projects while also shipping multiple side projects.
* Missed the submission and second week for the personal project due to family emergency. I delivered an MVP for Rails Purgatory, but did not get the chance to polish and expand functionality.  My favorite part of the current codebase is the switch to using decorators with the Draper gem, which took a view with over 200 lines of code and refactored to about ten.  The current codebase is [here](https://github.com/weilandia/rails_purgatory)

3. Group Work & Projects: 4
* I was able to lead my team on The Pivot to ship a solid app regardless of the animosity most of the team had towards the Pivot Pivot. Ultimately spent a large amount of time helping teammates develop their understanding of Rails and the web.

4. Community Participation: 4
* I spent a lot of time this module attempting to build a culture of continuous programming practice and improvement in the Brin Posse.
* I plan to continue leading Friday sessions on timed interview prep.

5. Peer & Instructor Feedback: 3
* I give feedback with intention and continuously aim to improve myself through both the direct and subtle feedback I receive.

### All the Goals
* Be able to consume and serve up a Rails API efficiently
* Stayed practiced in more difficult Ruby logic problems throughout module

### Projects

Below is a list of all project and assessment scores from Module 3 plus some side projects I completed.

#### Rails Purgatory

##### Notes:

* MVP delivered, but development has been stalled due to family emergency.  Plan for project to continue to grow throughout Mod 4 and beyond with hopes to deploy for public consumption.

##### Scores:

* N/A

#### Rails Engine

Assessed By Nate

##### Notes:

* Other ways to organize controllers
* Could use partials with jbuilder
* I like that you're reusing jbuilder views
* Good experimentation with Active Record, but I think there's some small gains to be made

##### Scores:

* Completion: 4
* TDD: 4
* Code Quality: 3
* API Design: 4
* Queries: 4

#### The Pivot

Assessed By Nate

##### Notes:

* Remember to buy Nate a big hat
* Polish the UX you have before you stretch for new UX or features. Red means stop, green means go
* Learn Selenium later. Like on another project
* Try to keep models in the models folder. PORO's would go in the lib folder.

##### Scores:

* Completion: 3
* Organization: 4
* Git Workflow: 3
* TDD: 3
* Code Quality: 3
* UX: 3
* Risk Taking and Creativity: 4

## Community

### Giving Feedback

>**Adam** "Adam has impressed me with his growth as a programmer.  His leadership in the implementation of the AirBnB clone for The Pivot led to an impressive app that showed huge growth in both front-end dev and a willingness to push the expectations of a project. Also, his grit in completing the Rails Engine queries without using Ruby was awesome to see. I think his firm grasp of programming fundamentals, coupled with his people skills, will quickly make him a strong team member on a dev team."

### Being a Community Member

>"Nick is my go to guy. Any question or problem is never to big for Nick to solve. He is a leader in our module and pushes all of us to do better. The talent Nick shows in programming is unmatched. I look forward to staying friends with him after Turing and seeing how our professional lives can intertwine."-**Adam**

### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Continued to run Hack Design on Thursdays at lunch. Led student session on Design Thinking that may take place every other week.
* I worked with Karina frequently as she was the only Mod 1 Student in Brin Posse and needed some extra help.
* I led multiple timed mock interview coding challenges during Friday electives
* I started the Brin Posse and led the team to get some code merged into exercism.io master
