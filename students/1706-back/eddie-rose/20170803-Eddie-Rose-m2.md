# Eddie Rose - M2 Portfolio

-----------------------

## A: Personal Growth

## Areas of Emphasis

I had a hard time in mod 1 and I wanted to do better this mod.  I planned to adjust my study habits based on that experience.

## Areas of Growth

Active Record queries.  I spent extra time studying these and it helped.

TDD. It seemed like a nuisance when we first learned it, but now it makes sense and I appreciate it.

-----------------------

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I found the individual work especially meaningful this mod.  I was able to work at my own speed and spend more time on areas I didn't feel comfortable with.  Group projects always add an additional level of complexity, but both groups I worked in were great and I gained an  appreciation for git work flow.

#### Bike-Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DesTodo/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

In this project you'll use Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.

I wanted to focus on learning routes and working with active record queries.  We worked on the first few iterations together and once we had enough built that we could work on different parts of the project we worked mostly independently.  I spent most of my individual time working on class and instance methods for the stations and some aspect of CRUD on the rest of the models.

Our group worked well together and I learned a lot.  This was the most difficult project of the mod for me.  At the end, I was really frustrated with active record queries so I dedicated time over the next few weeks to study those specifically.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/erose357/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

Let’s create an app to record your ideas. Host your app live on Heroku. Users can create, edit/update, show, and destroy only their own ideas.

My three goals for the project: complete the project, become more comfortable with TDD, finish functionality early enough to spend at least one day on styling

I enjoyed working on this project.  I felt comfortable enough with the rails and active record aspects that I was able to spend a full day on styling.  TDD made a lot more sense to me by the end, and, for the first time, I really appreciated the advantages of it.  Styling was more frustrating than I anticipated, but I learned a lot and I got some experience with Materialize.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jtruong2/little_shop)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

In this project you’ll use Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering.

I wanted to get more experience with authorization and authentication and continue to solidify my understanding of rails as much as possible.

I enjoyed working with my group, we got along well and they were great resources for help when I was stuck.  We decided to build the cart functionality together since none of us were comfortable with it. We also worked together to fix an active record problem we ran into when we didn't create a join table properly.  This worked well because sometimes in a group when you split up you aren't able to address some of your weak areas.  After that we split up just worked on stories in order.

## C: Final Assessments

### Timed Independent:

### 1. Workflow

* **4: Developer consistently breaks complex problems into small steps with logical sequence that is evident from git history**

### 2. Feature Completeness

* **4: Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests**

### 3. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style

* **4: Developer consistently establishes and utilizes ActiveRecord methods for effective and efficient results**

### 4. Rails Style / MVC

* **4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and establish logic in the appropriate classes**

### 5. Testing

* **3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may have trouble parsing errors or prioritizing next steps**

### Written:

#### Comprehension

*   3: Developer demonstrates sufficient comprehension of most critical concepts covered

#### Technical Communication

*   3: Developer’s responses are mostly clear and complete


I don't think this is my best work, but I'm happy with how I performed and I feel like I've improved considerably from mod 1.  I am comfortable with the concepts on the written test and this was my best performance on a timed assessment at Turing, so far.

-----------------------

## D: Module Outcomes

I feel like I should have asked more questions and I didn't take full advantage of learning from the instructors. I will work on this in the future.
