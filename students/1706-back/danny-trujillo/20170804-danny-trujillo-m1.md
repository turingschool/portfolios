# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

  This mod I was focused on spending as much time as I could learning the Ruby
  language. I think it's very important when first learning this stuff to have
  a good foundation of programming knowledge. Ruby seems to be a much easier
  language to be able to focus more on programming concepts instead of the
  syntax of the language. I would say I was moderately successful. I think I
  could spend a lot more time gaining a deeper understanding of what is
  happening behind the scenes. I think I learned as much as possible in 7 weeks.
  I feel like I've gained the resources and ability to further my own education
  individually.   

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  I struggled the most with Battleship. The way that project is setup, without
  iterations, made the design of the program difficult to guess from the
  beginning. I learned to be patient and not regret deleting code and starting
  over. I realized a couple of times that my fundamental design was flawed and
  had to start again. Through this process I gained a better understanding of
  program design and how to break a complex problem down. Another big struggle
  for me was workload management. Since we have so much going on at all times,
  it was a struggle to prioritize and manage everything.


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

  My favorite project was also the most challenging. Battleship had a cool end
  goal. You could actually play the game and see that it was working. My least
  favorite was Jungle Beats. I think after the struggle, the output of the
  "jungle beat" was less than satisfying.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

  The independent projects taught me a good deal about time management and self
  discipline. I took a lot of hours to complete them and staying on top of the
  workload without getting distracted was key. I also learned where to look for
  help when there isn't a partner to rely on.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

  Paired projects were a different challenge. I learned the importance of both
  being on the same page in regards to goals and expectations. It's easy to fall
  out of productivity if one of you is feeling like things aren't getting
  accomplished the way they should. Interpersonal relationship skills are
  invaluable in the workplace and the more we do here the better we will be
  prepared.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  My favorite gear up was the Mod4 guided one. I did Coding Schools or coding
  fools. We got into a very interesting discussion about the value of junior
  developers coming out of bootcamps such as Turing. It will be a whole new
  challenge once we graduate and start looking for jobs and discussions like
  that better prepare us for what we are going to face.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  I believe I contributed a positive attitude and a willingness to help others
  when and where I could. I think the more people are working together, the
  better it is for all of us.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  Next module I would like to become more involved in meetups and other Turing
  student sponsored events. I'd like to meet and develop professional
  relationships with as many more people as I could.
