# Joan Harrington - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  I set out to establish a foundation in programming, and establish myself in the Turing community.  I believe I've succeeded.  While I've not gotten as far as I would like, in ruby, I am  generally happy with the overall picture.  

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  I struggled with keeping everything we had learned in my head when I was stressed.  I'd do exercises, homework, projects, but my confidence wavered, and I would sometimes shut down when under the wire.  I'm getting better about it, but I believe it just takes a little more practice, and a little more faith in myself.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  I really liked all of the projects!  I mean...if I had to pick one, it would probably be bubble sort? That particular one was a tad mundane, compared to the others, but that's to be expected from something we're supposed to do in a couple days.  Battleship was difficult, and I hated started the poor thing, but once I got going, I really enjoyed the process.


What did you learn from your independent projects?
  I learned my strengths and weaknesses in programming.  It's hard to hide, from the things you aren't good at, when there isn't someone to make up for it by your side.  It makes you face your weakness, and improve upon it by either asking for help, and implementing a new strategy yourself, or researching the issue.  It also, on the flip-side of the coin, reinforces that you are stronger than you believe yourself to be.  A finished, or well done, project is its own reward, and looking back, thinking 'I did this', is a strange, but not unwelcome, feeling.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  I learned that I benefit greatly from having a 'sounding board', of sorts.  I perform much better when I can bounce ideas off of someone, or when I listen to their ideas, and we can form a battle plan together from some Frankenstein amalgamation.  I learned that I have so much more to learn, and that a difference in skill level should not cause a difference in contribution.  I already knew that equal contribution would be a cornerstone, but this reinforced the notion, that it's not only possible, but expected, and relished.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  I enjoyed the gear up concerning what not-to-say vs what-to-say, in regards to constructive feedback.  While it seems like a skill we already possess, it's often astounding exactly what people say, before they think, myself included.  I try to be careful, but the outcome isn't always what I intended.  I used to have a filter/think carefully, when I would speak in Japanese, but now, speaking in English, the language comes so naturally that it takes a concerted effort to phrase things correctly.  It's worth it though, as no one deserves to feel shunned, shamed, or otherwise hurt during Turing.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  This is the one area where I am not concerned.  While I didn't create any cemented groups, I supported my cohort members during their emotional-issues, self-doubt, and interpersonal conflicts.  I consistently provided a safe space, where my friends/anyone could come and discuss their issues.  I communicated with other mods, set up, and coordinated, help sessions between upper mods and our struggling members, and set up pairings between those whom I believed to be a good match in personality, or code style.  I fully intend on setting up a group at Turing for those who are having relationship issues.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  I would like to contribute my optimism.  That sounds hokey, but there are those who are concerned about their place, life, or who to connect with, while at Turing.  I think I am the person to go to, when these issues crop up.
