## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

    My objective was to stand under the waterfall and to collect ALL THE WATER.  

However, I quickly discovered that the waterfall is bigger than I am. This proved to be frustrating because I have no recourse to exteral collection vessels, and per my objective (read as: greed and hubris) I want ALL THE WATER, not just a paltry residual wetness. Because my surface area is relatively modest and most of the waterfall couldn't be contacted let alone absorbed', I've had to adjust my original expectations:

    Given my original two-part objective, I was only able to achieve the first part: I stood under the waterfall. 

    The secound part tured out to be more of a zen koan than an achievable goal, which simply indicates a misunderstanding of the task.  

    The discovery of this misunderstnading constitutes a success. 

    As in the parable of the Roadrunner and the Coyote, I will never capture the waterfall, and I have succeed at learning this lesson: 

    I don't master Ruby, Ruby masters me. 


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  I struggle with letting myself make mistakes and not being overwhelmed by my ignorance. 

  I had a lot of keyboard fright and felt intimidated by wading through the gunk of my error/failure-ridden code. But things have gotten easier with practice, and I've found a rhythm for moving through that discomfort.  

  I've learned that I want to:
   * stop using my mouse
   * embrace debugging from an emotional vantage point of curiousity rather than frustration 


The underlying struggle that I'm atuning to is: Maintaning a receptive mindset even when my carefully scripted solution doesn't play out as expected. I think this is sometimes known as patience. 
I'm intrested in finding new ways of approaching my feelings of disappointment so that they are less determinative of how I absorb the information my mistakes are sending me. 


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

  I liked working with recursion on the BST, Trie and sorting suite.  Because recursion is poetic. 
 
  Battleship was annoying because I didn't want to deal with printing things to the screen - I'm glad I didn't choose Frontend. 

What did you learn from your independent projects?
    
The independent projects were a good oppertunity for me to keep my hands on the keyboard. I mainly learned to recognize my tendency to get trapped by the pursuit of elegance; as the mod has progressed, I've become more content to just commit to an ugly solution... I mean a red to green... rather than dwelling on the ideal solution. '

What did you learn from your paired projects?

    I'm really into pairing. Sometime I'm especially interested in is exploring how to avoid group-think as a pair. I've noticed that even as a pair, we need a third perspective. 

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
The strengths finder session and introvert / extrovert sessions were both useful because of their specificity. 
I didn't care for the LinkedIn session because it(LinkedIn) doesn't' align with how I like to spend my time. 

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
    I was generally engaged at a conversational level. 
    

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
    I really apprechiated Josh's spike on learning techniques. Maybe not next module, but at some point I would be intrested in contributing in a similar way.
