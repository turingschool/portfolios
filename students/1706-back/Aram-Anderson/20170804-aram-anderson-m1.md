# Aram Anderson - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I feel like the I set out to learn quite a few things. In bullet points, I think it was something like this:

1. Learn about pure ruby fundamentals.
   * Syntax and style
   * Structure
   * Data manipulation
   * Conventions
2. Learn about programming in the bigger sense
   * Algorithms
   * Program architecture
   * Logical deconstruction of problems(for lack of a better term)
3. Learn about the programming industry

I think those were the big areas I had in mind coming in. I didn't really know what to expect in a lot of ways, because my familiarity with the subject matter was pretty shallow to start with.

My struggles this mod were mostly around rethinking the way I approach a problem. TDD has definitely been a difficult area for me, but I've come around. TDD offers some huge advantages.
Outside of school, it's been a struggle trying to create a reasonable balance between the demands of the program and the demands of my outside life. I'm still working on that, and really hoping that in the reset between mods I'll be able to create some specific ways to do better.

## Projects

My favorite project this mod was Complete Me. I found the data structure really interesting, and it was cool to learn more about using hashes on that one. I really enjoyed learning about recursion, and I feel like complete me gave me a much deeper understanding of how it works.

I think my least favorite was Black Thursday. I really liked the project itself, but it was very frustrating dealing with csv files that didn't actually correspond with each other. It just meant that there was one "right" path to take through the orm, even though logically a different way would have worked if the files had lined up.

In my independent projects, I learned that I need to be more organized. I feel like my approach tends to naturally veer toward scattershot. I kind of like that, but I feel like it's most certainly detrimental to my progress. I learned that having a clear path and micro-goals is extremely helpful for me, and I'm making strides to incorporate that strategy in my work.

In the paired projects I learned that I really like pairing. I was fortunate in that both of my paired projects set me up with partners I work really well with. I came into the program fairly worried about the paired portion of the work (group projects in college weren't my favorite) but in the end I feel like I got a lot more out of both projects because they were paired.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

I really liked the gender gap gear up. I think it highlighted some very important issues which many in the tech community don't put much thought into. It was also moving to see how these issues manifest in the real world, and impact real people's lives.

I think my least favorite was the strengths and storytelling gear up. I find the idea of "personal branding" pretty gross. I'm a human being, not a product. It's very likely just a semantic hang up on my part that's behind that feeling, and I can own that. I also know the core of the gear up is something I need to do, and I probably just need to get over myself.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I did sessions going through a small project with some other people from the mod during lunch a few times. That started out with another person just asking me about one of the independent assessments we took. A few people ended up being interested in what that looked like, so we just did kind of a live code thing and went through it.
I hope that was helpful for others, but it was actually very helpful for me. It really cements things for me when I have to explain them, and I'd like to try to do that more often.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I've offered to help people get personal sites up using jekyll. I'd like to do that. Much like the previous section, I feel like it would help me to help someone else go through that process.

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

In looking back at my mod 1 portfolio, I wanted to help people with developing a personal site. That didn't really happen, and I think that just didn't stay as a priority for me, or for many of my classmates. I feel like just staying on top of the workload ate up more time than I thought it would.

It's really general, but I think I set out this mod to understand how ruby relates to web apps, and how using ruby in rails is helpful. This larger idea is still something I'd like to explore in much more depth, but I think that will take time. I know that rails is mainly using ruby to accomplish what it's doing, but it's such a complex set of interactions that I feel like it will just take time to get a handle on what's happening under the hood in rails.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled with the memorization. In looking at the above answer, I think the real world result is that there is a lot of magic I don't understand in rails. That means I don't understand the logic, and using rails at this point is mainly just memorizing how to interact with it. I don't yet feel like I understand rails well enough to work through patterns of logic, but I think with time I'll get there.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

I liked little shop the most. I think it was interesting getting into the sessions stuff and implementing the cart. I think I just liked little shop the most because I feel like it was the project I learned the most from.

I didn't like blogger much. It just felt like I was parroting a tutorial without understanding what I was doing at all. I know that's part of the process, and especially in rails that knowledge comes through repetition. But even so, the process felt tedious.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned that styling is hard. I feel like that's something I'd really like to get better at.

I also learned that rails is chock full of rabbit holes to go down, and it takes effort to avoid them. I found myself wasting hours trying to figure out how to implement something, even if it wasn't necessary, just because I knew it could be done. I guess the main takeaway there is just learning to stay on track.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

There is a great deal of value in having a well thought out workflow and using the tools that help implement that. We were mostly good about sticking to that workflow, and it was clear when we went off track. The only merge conflicts that we ran into could be traced directly to straying from our workflow.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite was the Mod 4 led gear up on transhumanism. I think I just really like that one because it spawned a lot of interesting conversation. I think one of the more interesting sides of tech (and least talked about) are ethics. I think a topic like transhumanism makes those conversations unavoidable, and I think that's a good thing.

My least favorite was the session on agile. I just feel like I didn't get much out of it, and I'm not sure what I was supposed to get from it. I feel like agile is a good idea, but it strikes me as strange to think of it as something with any more importance than a workflow. It's pretty weak as a philosophy, is totally focused on programming as a commodity, and lacks an ethical agenda of any kind. That's obviously just my opinion, but I just see it as a guideline for a workflow.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

Not as much as I should have. I did a good amount of pairing with mod 1 students, and I paired with people in my own mod.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I've been looking into putting together a hackathon. I still feel like that's something I'd like to do, though it will take a lot more work to make it happen. I'd really like to see something that targeted needs in the nonprofit community, and made some connections for both the nonprofit sector and the coding sector. I feel like that's a huge need in the nonprofit world, and open source could be a good avenue to make that connection.
