# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

I wanted to focus on learning a new framework that I was unfamliar with. I ahve accomplished this through my capstone project.

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
Pass

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

  The biggest challenge for this assessment was the being able to identify which elements to create and properly displaying them on the page.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

What I enjoyed most about this challenge was that it allowed me to flex my jQuery muscles.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

  I relied on chrome's developer tools to select the right element, and then copy the exact element id and class.

* What did you learn?

 I learned how to use my browser's dev tools to assist me in indentifying which elemnts I needed to manipulate. I also learned about JavaScript directory and file structures from the whole assessment.


## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
Pass

* What was your biggest challenge?
  My biggest challenge was my response to building an elevator through OOP principles.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  What I enjoyed most about the challenge was that I got to understand a few gaps in my understanding of OOP.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  I plan on solving this challenge by studying OOP in the future. I plan to ask myself the same question and then make sure that I have a great answer ready.
* What did you learn?
  I learned about the gaps in my knowledge.

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  My biggest technical challenge was writing a API requests using JavasScript.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  I solved this by learning about the Fetch API, as well as learning how to write requests in plain JavaScript.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  What I enjoyed most about the challenge was learning how to write and API request in JavaScript, especiallly since they're pretty much integral to web apps.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  Fetch requests
  How to connect two seperate repos through API calls.
  Promise Chaining

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
  I would understand how and when to use async calls and functions. This would be really helpful in organizing my requests.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
  The experience was great since my partner was also in the same boat as me. We gave each other patience with whatever we were learning at the time.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  I would argue that my biggest challenge was the unfamiliarity I had with react native.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  I solved this challenge by researching various tutorials, videos, blog posts and old fashion trying things until something worked.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I really enjoyed developing for mobile particularly becuase of how clean and focus creating a UI felt. Additionally, it was the first time that I felt like a full stack developer.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  using geolocation
  authentication across an API
  using the AndroidManifest

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?
[Pokémon Showdown](https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown)

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

  The biggest technical challenge was being learning how their old function interface translated to the new makeChoices().   

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  We solved that problem by following the examples that the repo owners provided.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  That I was able to contribute to a software/app that I've used and love. Plus it was for the Pokémon community

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  Es lint was really interesting to learn about. It seems like a great tool to clean your JavaScript.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
Essentially Timeboxing certain efforts so that I can still work on other meaningful features. I stopped trying to do machine learning and create business analytics.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

Drafting the Gear Up may have a been a bit overwhelming with everything else going on, but my team mates were really great and truly made the planning process smoother. For the most part I enjoyed the experience because I really wanted to remind myself of growth-mindset techniques and re-learn alongside everyone else. I saw this as especially useful as we come up to graduation. The most rewarding part of this whole process was seeing how engaged everyone was with the material. People seemed to really resonate with my need to relearn growth mindset techniques and that was wonderful. 

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
I was the SAB rep for our cohort.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

Job tracking and research
Learning a new skill
Contributing to an Open Source Project

## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [Action Plan](https://github.com/rickyamparo/career-development-curriculum/blob/387f1fe2e372e30b62e91c3c247f57a06f5b0e97/module_four/post_grad_plan.md):
* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.
* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
