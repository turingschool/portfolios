* Improving Rafactoring Skills

## Self-Assessment

| Section | Category | Score |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 4 |
| B | **Individual Work & Projects** | 3.5 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 3.5 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 3.5 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 3.5 |

### Takeaways
* I learned how to solve complicated problems and find difficult issues on my own.
* I learned ways to maximize the benefits of paired programing time.
* Learned how to mentally process and divide complicated problems into workable chunks that lead to satisfactory outcomes.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects
**[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
  * In this project, we focused on consuming and working with data from public APIs
  * Learning how to consume API data and also deliver it to views. Replicating you own GitHub profile

**[Self Directed - World of Celebration](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
  * The goal of this project was to create a successful web application from a project idea. We created an app that would authenticate with a third-party service, consume an api, and solve an actual problem.
  * I really enjoyed this proect. I was proud of what I achieved and found major breakthroughs in ideas I was still tying together from mod 2. I plan on working more on this project once I'm done at Turing.

## B: Group Work & Projects
**[RalesEngine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
  * Use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.
  * Learning how to serve up API data and JSON was really exciting. Also, using advanced active record was a great mental workout. I also enjoyed the pairing assignmet more than I could have imagined. 

**[BrownField](NO LINK)**
  * In this project, we took a project from other students and implemented multitenancy, OAuth and served the data up in an API
  * Learned how to work in unfamiliar code. Learned how to backfill testing and modify testing on an application you've never worked on before. Learning how to take an application apart and successfully plug in new functionality and features.

> Rales Engine evaluation comments: There were no notes from the instructor in the grading ruberick submission. However, we were told that everything looked good and we had more than satisfied the expectations of the project.
#### 1. Completion
3+: Project completes most requirements but fails 3 (5 for individual project) or fewer spec harness tests.
#### 1. Test-Driven Development
3: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>80%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
#### 2. Code Quality
4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
#### 3. API Design
4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.
#### 4. Queries
4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
* I learned a lot about inclusiveness withing communities and how people are actually happier when there is the correct percentage of people unlike you withing your community. I really enjoyed the online exercise and visual demonstrations.

> [Cold Outreach](NO LINK)
* This was potentially the best GearUp I've been to in my whole time at Turing. Katie, Ellen, Jimmy and Dez did an amazing job leading this session and I saw the entire class grow from the experience.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
* Lead the Wozniak Posse. Created a place for all mods to work together to discover new languages and problem solving together. Posse now runs itself and is productive every week.
* Paired with other students at least 10 times this module

#### **Posse**
  * The posse had little to no structure and low attendance. Throughout this module it has gained structure and now is a place where students from all mods and programs come together to solve javascript and ruby problems together on a weekly basis.
  * Seeing people that originally had no desire to attend posses no looking forward to participating and contributing.
  * It's been a great experience to create a place where people feel comfortable to share ideas together in a safe space while solving problems with people of all skill levels.

#### **Playing a Part**

  * Helping people experienceing disputes find closure or at least the ability to interact in a civil manner
