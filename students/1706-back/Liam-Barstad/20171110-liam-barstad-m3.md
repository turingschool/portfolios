>* \I have many areas in need of improvement, but I have come away with a much more localized knowledge of what those areas are and how I can attack them. I will treat this module as a template for growth and a method of analysis for my own tendencies and habits.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/liambarstad/api_curious_reddit)**
>* \This is an app that consumes the reddit API, and provides a dashboard to succinctly control user functionality.
>* \I thoroughly enjoyed tackling the reddit API because it was difficult to implement and involved fetching a greater understanding of tokens and methods of authentication. However, I do not believe that its current state represents the finished product that I am seeking, and next time I would strive to create a shippable and useful product.

> **[Self Directed](https://github.com/liambarstad/JamHQ)**
>* \This is a site that is meant to be the only tool a musician would need to network, as networking in the music industry is mainly done by word of mouth and hearsay. It would give musicians the ability to upload their own sounds, connect with other musicians based on interests and common genres, and get in touch with venues nearby. Like LinkedIn, it could also be used by producers and venues to headhunt potential talent.
>* \I love this idea, and I will be working on it in the future avidly. My mental state during the course of its inception did not allow me to do the idea nearly enough justice. I would love to continue to work on it and use it as a portfolio item in the future and a template to experiment with dynamics that I will learn in the future. My goal, eventually, will be to turn this into a production quality site. Yes, even the security.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/liambarstad/rails_engine)**
>* \A new take on the Black Thursday project that we completed in Mod 2, Rales Engine turns business analytics into an API with endpoints that manipulate data entries such as invoices, transactions, merchants, and customers.
>* \It was surreal to see relationships built in seconds that had previously taken hours or even days to comprehend and implement. The real take away, however, was that I became much more fluent with dynamics such as ActiveRecord, API routing, and endpoint creation.

> **[The Pivot](https://github.com/mimilettd/the_pivot)**
>* \Little Shop of Useless Items: a vendor site debuting many stores with items and various categories. A minimal and sturdy interface made to provide an effective backbone and management tool for whatever wares a store might have to offer.
>* \This project made me exceedingly aware of the subtleties of group communication and the utmost importance of maintaining congruency and a friendly rapport. There is a world of knowledge and numerous theories that describe these dynamics, the social archetypes that exist, and the methods by which people utilize them. This project made me fully recognize that this is a multi-threaded skill tree, which I might even say will be appetizing to tackle. These skills will by no means be impossible to cultivate, but it will take analysis and proactive effort.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up](https://github.com/tylerjhevia/Programming-languages-gearup)
\Reading into Go and Elm and articulating the nuances of learning a new language brought into perspective what the purpose of such an endeavor should be. Each language has features that it does exceedingly well, and that should perhaps be the motivation to create such features. What a language can do should should drive the learning process. Tackling a new language should also be done in small sections, through gaining fluency of its constituent parts one step at a time. In the past, I did not have enough direction in which languages I wanted to learn, and attempted to ingest an entire language at once. This results in both a hollow understanding and does a disservice to whatever project or service I might be applying that knowledge to. Exercise, scaling, and repetition will be the ideal way to learn.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* \I did not give any lightning talks this module, and had no real pairing opportunities. I am, however, slotted on Friday the 10th of November (tomorrow) to give a presentation on the 3D printer and its capabilities. Regardless, I heartily look forward to better exploring these opportunities next module. Breathing space, as I see it, will be invigorating and allow me to extend my curiosity. What I learn will hopefully put me into a position to speak and share knowledge with others, and I look forward to that opportunity.

#### **Posse**
  >* \Lovelace posse did work on Javascript exercises, paired, and debuted useful and interesting resources that we had found out in the world.
  >* \I really liked how posses turned out this module, they were organized, involved, and satisfying to attend. I hope that experience can continue next module. Thanks are due to Nick Teets for reigning the posse in and establishing structure.
  >* \My posse gave me a good space to network, make friends, and create connections that will undoubtedly be useful in the future.
