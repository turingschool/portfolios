# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

I wanted to have a solid understanding of and comfort with JavaScript. I also wanted to dedicate adequate time to improve my interviewing skills, and search and apply to jobs.

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

Pass

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Getting the color to display correctly was challenging. I was not sure how to do that at the beginning and trying to keep myself calm was difficult.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

It was a new type of challenge, but the approach for solving it was similar to what we had previously learned in class.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I used stackoverflow to see how other people had approached similar issues and tried some of the suggestions approaches.

* What did you learn?

Stay calm, breakdown problems into small parts, and use google and stackoverflow.


## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

Pass

* What was your biggest challenge?

My biggest challenge was to try and explain the DRY principle to a 5 year old.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I seldom try to breakdown programming concepts to that level and it was a good reminder for me that it's helpful to have clear and simplified versions of technical concepts because they will help me grasp the concepts better and communicate with non-technical people in a concise and articulate manner.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

Having a few moments to think about a real world scenario that would apply to a five-year old was helpful.

* What did you learn?

There are many analogies that we can make/use to grasp programming concepts.

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

My biggest technical challenge was to get the node.js backend to connect seamlessly with the JS frontend. I especially had issues with getting the POST and PUT methods to work. The challenge was compounded because I had hardcoded an incorrect HTTP status code for an error, hence my assumptions for why I was getting an error was wrong.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I tinkered with trying to get the POST and PUT methods to work for a while. I googled a lot and asked for help.  

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

It was interesting to try and replicate a backend API that was written in Ruby, using JS/Node and have it connect with a frontend program that had already been written. It was something that I had not done before and I liked the exposure to this type of challenge.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

I got a better understanding of asynchronous JS, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and Hoisting.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

The biggest lesson was that an incorrect error message can lead to a lot of wasted time and effort and that at times, it is good to question whether the error message is accurate. I learned that I needed to look more into HTTP status codes in a little more depth.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

It was helpful to have a project pair who was good at breaking down problems and logical thinking. Though both of us were learning a new language while working on the project, it was helpful to have someone to bounce ideas off of and get suggestions for how to approach a specific problem.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Creating a dynamic chart.js feature was my biggest challenge. I wanted to have a chart display after a user had selected a series of buttons, rather than after they clicked just one button.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

My approach was to try and toggle the class on the buttons so that a method would only be fired if a set number of buttons had been clicked. I was not able to get this feature working but would like to figure it out in the coming weeks.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

It added an additional complexity to a feature that I felt comfortable with and it made me reach out to frontend students to get suggestions on how to tackle the problem.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

I learned how to integrate JS/Coffee Script into a Rails application, I used the lib directory for the first time, and web sockets within the context of using ActionCable.

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?

I started working on an issue on the Rails Girls Summer of Code.

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Jumping into a new and relatively large codebase was challenging.  

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

The developers used the MVC architecture and Rails conventions and I sought to understand how the codebase was working using Rails conventions.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

It was helpful to be exposed to an existing codebase that a lot of people had worked on, which is something that we will be doing on the job.  

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

I gained a new found appreciation for the MVC architecture, SRP and DRY principles because I saw how a code base that followed these conventions was much more easier to understand, even if it was large and complex.  

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

I appreciated the encouragement to use new technologies and integrate features that I had not worked on before for my capstone project. I tend to be very cautious in the risks that I take, and it was helpful for me to be reminded that I should try new features and work with new technologies. Moving forward, I need to develop more comfort and confidence in taking greater risks and working with technologies that I am not familiar with.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

It was really helpful to have two sessions dedicated to planning the Gear Up and it was nice to work with members of my cohort who had a good understanding of the Gear Up session that we had picked and were passionate about the issue. The most challenging part was getting students to who attended the session to have a more dynamic and inclusive conversation. Overall it was a good opportunity to take a step back from coding and focus on a policy related issue that affects us all as consumers/programmers.   

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

I was mostly focused on understanding JS and applying to jobs so I was not that involved with giving back to the community, beyond working on facilitating a Gear Up session.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md):
* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.

I am a Turing student who graduated from the backend program. Prior to coming to Turing, I worked at the National Endowment for Democracy, which is an organization that gives grants to other nonprofits. While working at the Endowment, I was fascinated by the ways in which technology was enabling civil society organizations to reach a broader audience and effectively call for government accountability. As I was getting close to my five years at the Endowment, I was thinking about the next steps in my career. This is when I started taking beginner coding classes and I loved how learning to program allowed me to interact with technology in a different way, as a coder rather than just a consumer. And the more I learned, the more excited I became about coding and creating applications that could help to improve lives. So thatâ€™s how I made my decision to transition into the tech sector.

* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
