## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
#### I hoped to practice and have a good understanding of all the lesson content in the module. I think I have achieved that. I set out to finish all projects with full functionality and I have achieved that (other than the Enigma). I hoped to develop my typing skills and knowledge of keyboard shortcuts, and though I started off practicing these skills, towards the end of the mod I became less committed and allocated less time to this practice. Once I had a level of experience in the mod working on diagnostics and practice, I wanted to further develop my TDD, as well as my refactoring and SRP use. While I feel my TDD is coming along, refactoring and SRP are concepts I continue to struggle with. Though I am practicing and committed to each, they are sometimes hard to develop alongside the copious new programming knowledge I have.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
## Paired projects were at times difficult for me (not due to my partners, both were great!). This was due to the fact that organizing the work between two people is more nuanced in the world of programming than it is in the academic world. Understanding reliances, overlaps, and areas where merge conflicts or other code breaking problems are encountered is a skill all its own, one that must develop alongside coding knowledge in order to be an effective teammate. Some problems have scope or "required work time" you don't really know until you reach, and so it can be complex to plan and alter plans. I struggled with reaching out for help, but with my prior programming experience- I feel good that I figured out lots of things for myself. At this point in time, I would feed confident asking other students for help should I encounter it in mod 2.

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
####
My favorite project was probably Enigma; it was the first project where I was able to see my programming in action applied to a real(ish) life problem that needed a solution. Though my code is still pretty ugly and messy, I set out to finish the difficulty extension, and knowing this ahead of time made the actual implementation pretty easy. This taught me a valuable lesson about making code that is very malleable to any task- even ones  you haven't imagined yet.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
#### I learned that I have great potential as a programmer. Getting a plan together and making it easy to move around are keys for not having to do too much towards the end and winding up with "smellly" code. I learned to start early and work hard- functioning code is really only about 40% of the battle. Making sure the code is SRP and DRY, keeping it legible and easy to understand for a program who isn't you is at least as important- and probably more so.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
#### I learned that communication is the basis for pairing. This may sound simple, but there several types of communication that must be mastered. Pairing communication, is essential to making sure all avenues for solving a problem are considered, and so criticism and encouragement can be delivered in an open and honest way. Communication outside of time together is also essential to let your partner know about changes in direction, ideas or scheduling. Also key is communication during a DTR, to be open and honest, and let your partner know your habits for scheduling, workflow, and your strengths and weaknesses. 

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

####I found the ageism gear up highly valuable (I think it was actually in my Try Turing that we did this one), I think the discussions were great and the problem was something I hadn't considered to be as dire as it is. The articles we read were beautiful illustrations of the problem. If you're looking for an example from the mod I would like to say that I enjoyed the growth mindset Gear Up. I really enjoyed the concepts of growth/fixed mindsets, and how one is much easier to develop than the other. I think this Gear Up was so important- it might be a good idea to revisit it at least briefly toward the end of the mod. I did not enjoy the telling you're own story one. Not that it should change or I don't recognize its importance- I just am anxious and uncomfortable when made to talk about myself.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
#### I did my best to aid my fellow students in any endeavors they needed assistance with. I formed friendships with students in my cohort, and feel very comfortable asking or giving assistance from any one inside it. I can't say that I spent much time meeting students outside of my cohort, or meeting any staff members that weren't related to any of my cohorts's activities. This is something I regret , and would like to improve upon next mod: it will be easier (for me at least) being the helper - not the helpee. Meeting with Meg and Allison at least once each during next mod is a

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
#### I plan on helping the 1708 backend cohort as much as possible, I feel really confident about the material in mod 1, and would love to expand that knowledge by assisting and teaching students in the next mod. Even though I absolutely hate the idea, if given another lightning talk, I would like to rehearse it more as to give a better performance (my last one was not good due to lack of preparation) and if not assigned one, I'll ask to do at least one during the cohort retro to better practice. I would like to maybe join in one of the channels on slack and meet more people from outside my cohort based on common interests.
