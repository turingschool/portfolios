# Andrew Mossefin - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

>* In this module, i wanted to learn how to build beyond simple logic programs. It was exciting to learn how to actually build a full app from the ground floor and databases, all the way to the end user view. I also wanted to learn how to effectively cooperate with a full group of several people on a project as opposed to just a single partner.

## Self-Assessment

| Section | Category | Score (optional) |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 3 |
| B | **Individual Work & Projects** | 3 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 3 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 2 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 3 |

>* Personal items aside, I'll be the first to admit that while Ruby was a learning process, it didn't completely challenge me. Rails, however, absolutely challenged me. Growth mindset was a difficult thing to graple with and improve on in this mod.

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

| Category | Score (optional) |
| ----- | --- |
| **Pairing Assessment** | 2-3? |
| **Written Diagnostic** | 5/5 |

>* I had a couple of major takeaways from the final assessment. The first was that just because you were able to figure out how to perform something one day, does not mean you will retain that ability if you shift focus onto something else shortly after. Second, was that I really have a weakness with testing that I need to improve. In mod-1 I had trouble implementing TDD even though I could accurately write a working program without it, and it took until the last couple of weeks in the mod to learn how to use testing (minitest) to complement my code. In this mod, TDD with RSpec was ESSENTIAL for furthering your code with new features. While i understood the Rails processes, I didn't take the time to truly understand how to decifer RSpec failiures, and that hurt me. When Beth aptly pointed this out, it made perfect sense as far as where I would get thrown off. I have to continue to try and train myself not to put the cart before the horse, like I've done in other aspects of my life. And, likely most importantly, I guess what I really need help with is leanring how to ask for help.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post:
> [Rails to Heroku Guide](https://andrewmossefin.info/post)

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
>* Blogger what a bit of a shock to the system after initially getting acquainted to building a rails web app with sinatra. At first, i didn't think it would be that much of a difference. But well all the 'magic' items and methods in rails started doing everything for you, it was a bit intimidating and frustrating trying to remember what did what without seeing all of the logic laid out in front of you. I honestly didn't think that I was going to get used to it or like it. Now I can't imagine doing the larger projects we are now entirely by hand in sinatra.
>* With MixMaster, I really enjoyed deploying Heroku and seeing an app actually rendering online and not just on my local. RSpec threw me for a bit of a loop though, because I had just come to feel extremely comfortable with performing TTD using minitest. So that learning curve began all over again.

#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
>* I really enjoyed Job Tracker because it allowed to see see a (mostly) fully featured Rails app from back(end) to front(end). Also love that in Rails Mini we were allowed to choose our own design for an app. Even though i think mine was probaby too ambitious, it was a good experience to break free from a structured excercise and figure out how to make an app work on your own.


## C: Group Work & Projects

> **Bike Share**
>* N/A

> **Little Shop of Orders**
>* Created the [finest picklery](https://wecanpicklethat.herokuapp.com/) in all the land!
>* This project was truly a great experience. I'm almost thankful that I had to miss 'bikeshare', just so that I could immediately see how to work well as a group. I never could have imagined in earlier pairs how useful waffle.io can be. But when you have multiple people on different tasks and sending multiple pull requests to be reviewed and merged, it was an absolute lifesaver. I also ganed the experience of a 1-to-3 driver-navigator session while developing. While I still prefer one-on-one code pairing for features (too many cooks in the kitchen), it was valuable to learn the dynamic of how to each give your own imput without talking over anyone or stepping on toes. Finally, I gained LOADS of exposure and knowledge about HTML and CSS, especially how they operate within rails.

\"Awesome"


##### Feedback to me for Little Shop

  * From Joseph:
  `All I can say is that We Can Pickle That is the prettiest project we’ve ever produced and you are a styling master. I enjoyed pairing with you at the start of our project, and appreciated you reaching out to pair towards the end as well, even when I couldn’t or was sadly neck-deep in another feature. You’re willing to put in long hours, you take setbacks and code explosions in stride, and I feel like you’re good at clearly communicating your opinions and thoughts, while still being flexible to anyone else’s contributions. I wish I’d asked to pair along with you for some of the styling, I’d love to learn how you did it. Hopefully we can do that some more on our next group project!`

  * From Lauren:
  `Hey Andrew! Really enjoyed working with you on the little shop project. If I had any constructive feedback for you, it's fine tune your git workflow. As mentioned in today's eval, if I could change something about the project implementation, it would be making sure the following was a clearly articulated best practice for our git workflow: 1. pull down from master, 2. merge master with your current branch, and 3. run RSpec before pushing/making a pull request to ensure your new code also passes any recent code that was merged to master since you last pulled down. You're funny and did a flipping awesome job on our project's styling. I think aside from all the neat features we implemented in our project, the styling really tied it together and set the stage for an awesome user experience. I really appreciate all the work you did to get it looking as professional as it did, with lots of funny little tid bits and flair. I'm ridiculously proud of our project!`

  * From Jack:
  `For Andrew: It was really cool to finally get to work with you! Your work on the styling was really critical to the success of this project. The attention to detail, and willingness to push through the gritty details of the styling. I really liked that you had no problems putting in after hours time, and caused literally no issues, social or otherwise. Areas for improvement: When you get deep into a feature or branch, make your life easier by pulling down master and merging it in occasionally.`


## D: Professional Skills


#### **Professional Development Workshops**
> [Warm Outreach, Agile Process, Feedback](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-b/andrew_mossefin.md)

#### **Gear Ups**

> [Empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)
\I am fairly conscious of my priviledge as a white male, but i will never knkow exact;y what it may be like for someone else. All I can do is try to place myself in someone else's position and be mindful of that and how the may perceive things differently from me.

> [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
\My level of grit has increased significantly in my time at turing. I'm much more comfortable with being uncomfortable, and pushing myself farther than i think i can go. On the flip size however, i've also learned to step back and take a break in order to stay productive.
> [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
\Automation is coming whether we want it to or not. It's simply to practical not to use considering where we are at with technology. Apparently something close to half of all US jobs will be lost to automation in the coming few decades, so we need to figure out how to retrain and reorient the work force.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Little Shop

  * For Lauren:
  `Hey Lauren. First and foremost, you absolutely CRUSHED it as the project manager. As we talked about in the eval, the fact that you chopped every task and item into a detailed individual card on waffle made things so much easier for everyone and gave us all clear direction on the project. You also still remain the undisputed git flow master. Very glad that I had you in my group and we finally were able to work together. Only input would be that sometimes when you get into the zone, I know I’d appreciate if you communicated more clearly on things you want to change or were changing. For example, when performing your git wizardry (teach me your ways!). That’s the only think i can’t think of. Other than that, you are a champ. Very proud of what we accomplished on this, and I think you were one of the biggest driving factors in that.`

  * For Joseph:
  `Joseph: It was honestly great working with you. Your constant positive attitude and hunger to keep on moving through stories and issues is enviable. The combination of those attributes as well as knowing your way around the code, made it really easy and enjoyable to pair up with you on user stories or just solving random issues. The work you did on the admin and analytics functions was awesome and I think that really drove the project home in the eval. Only feedback I would have is that sometimes it seemed like you may have had a different idea from someone else in the group, but didn’t necessarily assert that. We’re all friends, so always feel free to speak your mind. Hope we get to work together again in the future!`
  * For Jack:
  `“10/10, would code again”
Besides offering stability to the group, you also added humor which ALWAYS makes a project more enjoyable and usually helps it run smoother. The sales analytics work you did was fantastic, especially that it had the mailer integrated into it. I think Beth was kind of blown away that you could actually mail out a full report. No real critiques come to mind, at least from what I saw this time around. You’re easy to work with and know your code. You were a huge part of this project turning out as amazing as it did. Dr. Picklemeister would be proud.`
