# Seth Moser - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> I wanted to be able to make a website that can take in data from imgur.com and create folders based on favorited pictures. Now that I have all this info on API's it's a self challenge that I am very anxious to start

>* I really enjoyed this mod and am glad i know how to take info from other websites. I never thought websites would have so much information/data available for free for people to use.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
>* Create a site that uses the reddit api and can show your subscribed subreddits, posts, comments, and rules.
>* It was really awesome learning how websites save data and allow for the transfer of data accross a website.
>* Working with reddit felt really rewarding considering only two others chose it. Even though it was harder it was fun!


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)** 
>* Create an internal api and allow data to be shown on my website as JSON.
>* As much as I dilike the way hashes look, the usefulness of this project and what we learned is invaluable, and I can't wait to apply it to other self projects.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/NicholasJacques/corkboard)** 
>* I worked on getting the site deployed using DigitalOcean
>* It really gave me a new respect for people that use ubuntu and vim. After working with nano throughout my user story and finally getting the hang of it near the end. It's just incredibly frustrating not having all the different tools available normal editors have.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://github.com/stovermc/grab_bag)** 
>* I loved how challenging it was. Making me pursue things i'd never thought I'd understand and getting it to work is really rewarding
>* Seeing how websites save image data, or data in general is really awesome, esspecially learning the backgrounds of zipping files it's really odd and not something you generally think of when donwloading files.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
Being in the majority of society it's really weird to actually think about something that I previously had not given a second thought.
Hearing the horrors of the types of things people say even when they're not meaning to be offensive is incredibly terrifying and I don't know how people live with some of the comments I read.
It really makes me think about what I have probably said that could have been sensitive to someone without thinking and will definitely make me be more careful in the future.

> [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
I like being around people that are like me, it gives me something to talk about and connect with. Although it can get bland and boring and seeing as how I could be content with is is possible. Taling to new people with different life experiences and tastes is a great thing, and being able to learn new things from them is a lot better and how diversity can naturally segregate itself is a sad thing to think about.

> [Choose your own adventure](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)
I went to the Universal Basic Income #2 and found it incredibly interesting! It's not something i've ever thought of. But the trouble with it is there's not enough research at all. And the research that has been done has not been done as well as it can be to make accurate assumptions on whether it works or not. I don't currently have any strong opinions on it because I have no data to support either side. Some people are all for it but without seeing any experiments I don't know how someone can choose a side. But I'm all for attempting. We need to try something new.


## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* I've been working on trying to figure out an issue in the GitLab community edition. Although I haven't been able to complete it I had a lot of fun seeing the way that opensource projects work and the different ways commit messages are made.

#### **Posse**
  >* My posse worked on creating a arcade machine
  >* The physical building of the different parts was probably my favorite thing.
  >* It helped strengthen how important communication and timing is. Every different part needed to be completed to put the whole thing together.

#### **Playing a Part**

> I've offered to many mod 1-2 students my help and even just answered questions through slack
> One thing that I'm particularly proud of is lending a pair of noise cancelling headphones to another student for his entire time at turing allowing him to focus while at home with his drum playing room mate.
