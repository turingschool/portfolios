#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
Blogger was a huge tutorial with a lot of things that were beyond my grasp at the time. In a way it felt like drinking from a firehose; far too much to take in at once. Even though I wasn't able to absorb it all in that short amount of time, I'm **really** glad we did it. Just going through the motions gave me a familiarity for the workflow and syntax of a rails app, and when I returned to those topics later, I felt a lightbulb moment of recognition for each one.

Mix Master was much smaller in scope, and was were I really felt I understood making one-to-many migrations.


#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
Job Tracker was a good follow-up to Mix Master, building on everything we'd done so far and adding a few new topics.

The Mini Project was the first project where we had full control over what we wanted to make and how to implement it, and was a great learning experience. I'm going to keep returning to my project to add new features as I learn more in later modules.


## C: Group Work & Projects

**Bike Share**

Bike Share is a web app for viewing San Francisco bike station analytics.

This project was reminiscent of Black Thursday in that we had to pull a huge data set from CSVs. The scale was much larger and the analytics required ActiveRecord and SQL queries. This was also our first back-end project to involve significant styling.


**Little Shop of Orders**

Little Shop is an online store app. It brings together all of the Mod2 principles of the MVC model, ActiveRecord, Factory Girl, as well as authentication and authorization.

Bike Share evaluation comments:
* Plan out your database relations in detail, but don't be afraid to change them later.
* Good work incorporating SQL into your ActiveRecord. Stay away from ruby enumerables that make queries for each item.
* Remember to push logic down the stack, from view, to controller, to model
* Keep a running commentary and conversation on github, both to communicate with teammates and to leave documentation for the future.

#### Bike Share Experience

* Bike share was a big project for a three-person team, but we played well to each others strength and developed a good plan and workflow from the start. We hit a big snag when we started doing serious database queries before we learned ActiveRecord, but got it done in the end.

Takeaways:
* Stay away from ruby enumerables that make queries for each item. Replace them with ActiveRecord methods whenever possible
* ActiveRecord can be flexible, finding items by objects or IDs, and changes will alter your code less than you might think.
* Remember to push logic down the stack, from view, to controller, to model
* The larger the team, the more essential github workflow and constant communication become.

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share

From Maria Stenquist:
Joseph! We didn't get a chance to work together during module 1, but I was really glad that we finally got to work on Bike Share together. During the deluge of new topics being thrown at us, you took a very methodical and patient approach to working through the project. Your demeanor during the project was very calm, empathetic, and you were always driving the project forward. Also, you were very in-tune with how others were feeling in the group and as such you were empathetic towards us. You are a rockstar at calmly & collectedly battling errors, and your technical strengths during the project include TDD, quickly learning RSpec, and ActiveRecord methods. I had fun CRUDing out the last component of the project with you--I think the CRUD finally stuck after that point! In addition, whenever I had a question about a piece of functionality, or I was struggling to understand a concept, you would always stop to take the time to patiently explain to me what was going on, or to resolve a disconnect that I had. Further, as a community member your non-judgement and acceptance of others really makes you a valuable Turing student! I look forward to seeing all the awesome projects you contribute to as a software developer, y tengamos que practicar español un día pronto!

From Jack Pincus:
Patience is definitely one of your virtues. I was always impressed by your ability to keep an even temper, and keep progressing through issues in a measured and methodical way.
Process is one of your strong points. You have found a development style that works very well and you follow your own rules.
Areas for improvement:
Familiarity with environment. During bike share you mentioned that you were still getting used to using the mac ecosystem. Working on Little Shop, it seems like you have already learned a lot of awesome working practices.

##### Feedback from me for Bike Share


  Maria:
    Working with you on this project was a pleasure. It's clear that you design a project with the end in mind, and our BikeShare app was much stronger for that. We really benefited from your front-end expertise and your good-natured approach to every challenge.

    I can't think of any areas for improvement except to say don't sell yourself short. You are clearly a talented programmer with strong skills in front **and** back-end development. When you drove in BikeShare we knocked out a full set of CRUD requirements with clean, concise code. If you're ever nervous, remember being unfamiliar with a framework isn't the same as being bad at it. Dive in and you'll see that you're every bit as capable as the best in our module.  

    Thanks for being a good teammate as well as a good programmer. I really admire how you always know when we should ask for help. I struggle with that, and I learned a lot from how it saved time, made our project smoother and maximized our learning. You were also so supportive and ready to pair and talk through anything. Those skills will be an asset to every team you work on. ¡Gracias por la ayuda!


  For Jack:
    You did an excellent job as our project manager, combining separate skillsets, schedules, and balancing project priorities. I think it's a testament to your process that we got so much done with just a three person team. Your sense of humor literally makes our code better, since it made team coding a blast. As far as improvement, maybe we could have approached ActiveRecord better? Different team members ran into the same problems, and we ended up repeating bad Ruby enums in a few places. It might have been worthwhile to pause our coding and have an AR study session, or share "AR lessons learned" at a check-in. Thanks as well for putting in the longest Wednesday night ever to muscle single-handedly through those insane analytics methods. You've got some serious coding skills.

#### **Posse**
The Wozniak Posse has been fantastic this module. We've gone over stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees, heaps and Big O notation. My favorite part has been learning about the underlying factors that make certain data structures more or less efficient for particular problems.

#### **Playing a Part**

At the end of last mod I wanted to contribute back to the Turing community by tutoring and pairing more. Instead of waiting to be asked like in last module, I actively reached out to Mod 1 students and my own classmates, offering to pair on projects, and set up some weekly pairing sessions. It's made a big difference, and I've paired more often and with more people.

Next mod I want to keep pairing and host a spike or lighting talk.
