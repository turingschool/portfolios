# Joseph Glass - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

  This module I've increased my knowledge of Ruby by drilling, refactoring projects, and using TDD to write clear, readable code.

## Self-Assessment Scores

## A: End of Module Assessment

| Category | Result (pass, fail, pending) |
| ----- | --- |
| **Pairing Assessment** | PASS |

| **Diagnostic** | PASS |


#### Assessor Comments

Independent Timed Assessment
* excellent testing - small steps are evident
* some more edge case testing couldn't hurt in the future
* great work on the last iteration!
* thorough git workflow is also evident

#### Notes

*   Credit Check had some overly-long methods, so organization and style became a focus of improvement for my second and third projects.

### Pair Feedback

### Project 1: Night Writer (Diana Whalen)

Joseph, I’d like to start by saying that this was a learning experience, and for this I am grateful. I thought the strengths you brought to the table were being methodical, organized, and thorough. At the outset, I thought it would be very helpful that you took so many notes, so that we could use these as a resource when breaking down the project spec, and to be used in Pivotal Tracker, and I also very much appreciated your methodical approach in gathering information that may be relevant. In my opinion, this helped us get through the initial slump of getting oriented with the project. I thought going over what we had tackled, and what remained was helpful, as being thorough ensured items were being checked off the list, and I really appreciated that this is something we were both inclined to do.  
A few things to consider for future paired or group projects… I think you have room to improve in regards to collaboration, communication, and innovation. At the outset of the project, you stated Pseudocode and Testing were some of your weaknesses, which I happened to have stated as areas of strength on my end. Based on this and us discussing it, it seemed ideal and complimentary in that we would be able to learn from one another and our combined strengths covered all aspects of the project.  In terms of writing code, we started on the right foot with TDD, but this went off-course when you decided to start writing out code for the program on your own that Saturday, which we neither discussed nor agreed to. That decision resulted in this code being neither Test-Driven nor Paired, these being two major pieces of this project. Being excluded at this critical juncture meant that I could not build testing even after the fact, as you were making changes, and relegated me to chasing after other aspects of the project that were not currently in a state of flux. I continued to communicate with and engage you, in an effort to establish teamwork, but don’t feel we were able to reach this state. I found it disingenuous that while you referred to the project in first person perspective throughout, you suddenly and for the first time used “we” during our final assessment.
I feel that this project was a missed opportunity for each of us to benefit the most from one another’s unique skills, which is unfortunate. I hope that in the future you will consider using your strengths to enrich your teammates, and share the valuable assets you have to offer, which could have a lasting and positive impact, not just within a project, but on all connected to it. I also think you would benefit from taking more risks in trying new things, as you are more capable than you may realize.


### Project 2: Black Thursday (Ken Lee)

Hey Joseph, your skill and understanding of everything we've learned so far is mind blowing. You ability to work as a pair is exactly what I needed to learn what a perfect pairing is. Thank you for that. I felt we made a great team where our strengths and weaknesses balanced each other out.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset
It's hard to ignore current failure. It's hard to ignore current success. But in order to progress, you need to focus on what actions bring growth, not which have a short-term payoff or short-term punishment. As you learn to focus on the process, not the immediate outcome, you're more willing to take wise risks, to push yourself to failure, to leave the comfort zone and enter the growth zone. Recognize that every single skill is developed, and that as you focus on your weaknesses, they can become strengths.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things
Attention is a limited resource. Instead of trying to develop a passable skill level in many areas, practice small skills to mastery. Break large skills into small ones, then practice them. Once they are automatic, they'll take almost no attention, and you can focus on mastering the next skill. To effectively master skills, you need repeated practice over a large number of examples, with excellent feedback, given by expert mentors (preferably) or at least self-evaluation.

#### Session 3: Stress Management
Build stress management into your routine. Find things that relax and rejuvenate you and build them into your schedule. The times when you are most under stress are when you can least afford to skip them. Personally, I find exercise, prayer and meditation, and reading to be the most relaxing. Cooking and spending time with family and friends are the best activities for recreation and feeling like I've given my brain a break from coding. I can systematically reduce stresses if I plan for them. For example, if my commute is stressful, I can leave ten minutes early and listen to podcasts on my way.

#### Session 4: Personal Stories and Connections
Each of us come from different backgrounds and bring different values and experiences. These different lenses bring unique strengths and insights to our groups, but differences can also lead to division or miscommunication if not addressed. For example, if one group member is an introvert, they might not feel included or enjoy the work style of extroverts. Being aware of these differences, and seeking out the opinion of each group member ensure everyone can thrive with their common values.


#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap
There were more similarities between myself and the girls featured on the movie than I expected. I identified with the struggle of having interest and passion but no economic or educational opportunities for studying programming. There were large differences in my experiences, as I've thankfully not experienced gender bias to the degree they have. My role as a member of this community is to stand up against all sexism and exclusion, as well as to stand up against unkindness and proactively reach out to any who might feel lonely, unwelcome, or different. I was especially interested in how the education pipeline is a major contributor to the current gender disparity in tech.


### Community Participation
I've enjoyed the overwhelming support and sense of community here at Turing, and have tried to cultivate those cultural values for my module and future students. Whenever I find a useful link or training resource, I pass it into our slack channel so others can use it as well. I was able to use my lightning talk to research and present on Deliberate Practice to help my classmates make their practice time more effective. On an individual level, I have paired with many classmates to work on their weak points and drill fundamentals, and they have mentored me in turn on my weak points. Next module I want to review the coursework ahead of time in order to be a more effective mentor.
