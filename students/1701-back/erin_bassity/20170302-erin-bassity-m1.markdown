# Erin Bassity - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came to Turing to learn how to write code, but also to think more logically and develop technical ability. My overall goals for mod 1 were to gain a working proficiency in Ruby, test-driven development, application complexity, debugging, version control and command of my desktop environment. I also wanted to better develop my collaborative skills.

#### Assessor Comments

*   Pairing assessment: Got through IT2 talked about using docs more and using pry more efficiently.
*   Diagnostic: A couple small misses but overall nice job.
*   Independent time assessment: Great, clean code throughout; try to cleanup leftover prys before submitting; tests are exceptionally clean and concise; looks like you were making a good effort towards iteration 3; could use some edge case testing throughout, but overall testing looks good.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects:

* Project 1 (Beth Knight):
  ```
  Dear Erin: Here is why you are amazing… You came in on the weekend to work with me. Our communication was completely open. I never felt like we butted heads. Instead, you listen and gave feedback like a champ. When we got stuck, you reached out to people. The file.io was incredibly hard and you took it on. I think you acknowledge where you are not clear and seek help. Here is what you need to work on… Writing more code. I feel like I stole your learning by taking over most of night_writer.rb.
  ```
* Project 2 (Sam Landfried)
  ```
  It was a joy working with you! I appreciated your commitment to having a successful collaboration experience. Our daily retros helped us calibrate our shared time and project strategy, which was awesome and productive. I believe we spent virtually every minute of work time on this project together, which was a first for me. I value constructive feedback at moments like these, but I'm struggling to think of anything I think you could have done differently to improve our experience. As far as your personal development with code goes, I think you're making swift progress through new terrain, and it's clear that you're not limited by algorithmic thinking or any higher-order concepts. The walls you hit always seemed to be about syntax issues and Ruby functionality, and those will recede as you continue engaging the language. So I guess my only advice for the future is keep on trucking! I look forward to working with you on future projects.

### Gear Up

#### Session 1
Gear Up - Growth Mindset [Link](https://gist.github.com/somedayrainbows/b5f3c4c95e28d92437553052ec112efc)

Note: I wasn't the notetaker for my group so I lack the others' summaries, but here are my own personal reflection notes.

My past educational experiences (traditional learning environments and traditional educators' and parents' expectations etc.) definitely encouraged a fixed mindset. For me, grad school was my first real exposure to "growth mindset" even though I didn't know it had a name until today. Grad school, however, for me, was generally theory-based, so this kind of environment is definitely new. I really expected to have more of a frustrating experience this week, but it's only week one. This week has been wonderful, however, and the Turing team has done such a great job helping us keep expectations in check, and I haven't felt the frustration I expected as a result. Instead, I've viewed each barrier in a positive way and remind myself that I'm not there yet (and won't be for a while). The culture of our mod1 cohort supports growth mindset, and I feel comfortable "being uncomfortable" and breaking down the big overwhelming things into manageable parts.

#### Session 2
Getting better at doing difficult things [Link](https://gist.github.com/somedayrainbows/b9de84fab16d410208cc3fde6b2f452c)

Thoroughly enjoyed the video of Kathy Sierra, especially her Column A/B/C framework for things we "can't do (A)", "Can do with effort (B)", and "Mastery (C)". Learned that B is the biggest drain of cognitive resources, and simply learning this helped me better understand why I feel sometimes that I am not retaining anything in the way that I wish I were. Humans' cognitive resources are scarce, precious, and easily used up. We hit the trouble zone when we have a pile-up on B and sometimes that can lead to incomplete mastery on C. Sierra suggested the solution lies in splitting B into smaller and smaller subskills and tasks and spending around 3 sessions of no more than 45-90 mins max on those items. She said if we cannot move them into C at that point, then we need to break them down more (i.e. they are still too big). Super helpful context for our time at Turing.

Reflection answers: I make a big effort to manage my learning process. I make lists of priorities and constantly order and reorder them depending on where I think I need to focus or practice. Challenges at the moment include feeling like I don't have enough time to complete all of the lesson review, processing, drills, and work assigned (and unassigned). I also try to break down everything so that it feels more manageable and constantly tell myself "you can do this. You just won't get to column C for a while."

#### Session 3
Managing Stress [Link](https://gist.github.com/somedayrainbows/5f768e389acc6fb5e00d3f12de26c0ec)

Reflection:

When has my growth mindset(GM) been challenged in the last week? When has it helped me? What do i need to be even better at growth mindset?

This week, I felt my growth mindset falter a bit during our pair project when I tried to do a chunk of the last bit of the project by myself. I didn't do a ton of the TDD coding for the night_writer.rb file (the big part of the first part of the project) and focused instead on the piece I felt less comfortable with, the file I/O portion. When I tried to TDD the night_reader.rb file on my own, I felt stuck and didn't know where to go with it. It was the first time since being at Turing that I questioned myself and my place in this program. Didn't feel good. I felt like I didn't know how to do anything in that moment. But it didn't last, I switched to doing something else and then went to bed.

GM helped me this week too, I just keep telling myself that I am capable of continuing to develop aptitude, knowledge, and skill in this program. I'm pretty mindful of it all of the time.

Managing stress: I'm doing a decent job managing stress, I realize after reflecting on it. I am:

- keeping up with walking my dogs (about half the time, luckily my partner is doing the rest)
- riding my bike
- walks at lunch
- keeping a routine (time with partner, eating mostly healthy, managing sleep)
- talking openly about stress with partner and classmates and fellow imposters in the imposter lunch/group
- cooking healthy food
- limiting booze
- taking breaks

things I need to do better:

- ask for help sooner --I'm sometimes struggling too long when I get stuck
- plan study time better when I'm at home/away from Turing
- work through my to-do list of drills and study/review more efficiently
- try to keep up with my morning/evening workouts better

#### Session 4
Personal stories and connections

What brought me here?

I was tired of working in marketing (an accidental career to begin with) and wanted a change after more than 10 years of it. I didn't know what to do next, but had some interest in coding from learning HTML and CSS in the early 2000s and learning a little PHP in the course of building Wordpress sites over the years professionally. I went to a few coding weekends including Girl Develop It and Try Turing and was hooked. I really didn't think I would even be a candidate or be accepted, but then I did.

My lenses: Progressive, feminist, awareness of privilege, loyal/dedicated friend/sister/partner, dependable & empathic human, risk taker, justice-oriented

Values: Empathy, curiosity, bravery, loyalty, perseverance, flexibility, positivity

How do I demonstrate my values? I consider others' feelings/situations, I show up for others, I put in the time and emotion labor, I listen, I make jokes, I ask questions, I check in

Can others identify my attempts to demonstrate my values? I hope so! And I think so (most of the time); I try very hard to embody them.

#### Session 5
Code: Debugging the Gender Gap (film and discussion)

(can't remember the specific question, but something like this:) How have things at Turing related to the film?

Things here are/have been similar and different... similar in that the internal struggle I have in terms of convincing myself that I am smart enough to be here is persistent, especially when the experiences of others in ability or technical knowledge seem so much deeper than my own. It's easy to look at others and and make assumptions about my own potential for achievement and comprehension ability. I really related to the theme in the film touching on the learning gap for girls -- I was never really encouraged to do well in math or science and went to a poor rural school until 10th grade when my parents moved me to a larger school to have better exposure to more academic areas. There, in 10th grade algebra, one teacher spent extra time with me and tried to make me understand that I just didn't have enough experience with math yet, but was as capable as the other students. But 10th grade was a little too late.

Anyway, I loved the film, and one of the reasons I was drawn to coding is precisely because of the lack of women in tech. I am extremely happy that the culture at Turing is very different than the common professional environments presented in the film, but nonetheless concerned about dealing with those issues when I leave Turing and enter the workplace as a developer.

### Community Participation

I have participated in Joan Clarke Society and Imposters Lunch while at Turing. Natalie Barron and I are taking over the leadership of Imposters next mod since Noah is graduating.
