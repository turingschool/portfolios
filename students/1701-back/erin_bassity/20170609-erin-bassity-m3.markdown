-----------------------


## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

**[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
* [BabyGit Repo](https://github.com/somedayrainbows/apicurious)
* In this project, we focused on consuming and working with data from public APIs. I chose Github and created a mini clone of the site by consuming its API. I also implemented the OAuth protocol to authenticate users and learned how to make an API call once in a test, save it, and then stub for subsequent tests using VCR.
* This project was the toughest of mod 3 for me, but also the most rewarding once I started understanding how to consume an API by creating a service poro and other poros to call and manage the data consumed from the API.


## B: Group Work & Projects

**[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)** 
* In this project, we used Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API that exposed the SalesEngine data schema.
* This project was instrumental in my understanding of developing endpoints to expose an API.

**[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**

**Cloney Island Sprint 1** 
* In this project, our team built a new platform from scratch to handle multiple types of users (guests, registered users, and admins). We developed a clone of AirBnB, a “greenfield” project. We created a secure web application that supports multitenancy, create seed files, consume an external API to display weather conditions on all property pages, expose an internal API, among other functionality.
* This project was a wonderful experience. I really enjoyed developing the service and supporting models to consume an external weather API and display weather conditions on our site. I participated in styling, strengthened my git process knowledge, developed wireframes, wrote unit tests and several features, and enjoyed working on my largest rails project to date with a great team.

**Cloney Island Sprint 2** 
* In this project, I joined a new team and moved to another project developed during Cloney Island Sprint 1, a clone of Kickstarter. This sprint gave us exposure to working with “brownfield” development and was a wonderful and valuable experience.
* The aspect of this sprint that took up most of my time was learning how to use jQuery and AJAX to add a feature that allows users to upvote a project, which saves a vote for that user on that project only (and allows the user ONLY one vote on that particular project) in our database. The user can also downvote the project in order to remove her vote from the project. These actions happen via AJAX calls without a page reload. This was a challenge for me given me limited exposure to Javascript, jQuery and AJAX to date, and it proved quite valuable and fun for me in terms of learning.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
* Microaggressions are like death by a thousand cuts to marginalized people and are unfortunately disregarded by many as “unintentional” or committed by “nice people” who don’t know any better because of social conditioning. They are still awful even if unintentional, and I was surprised that some in our discussion were (unintentional) apologists for the offenders. I don’t think there’s any one right way to handle microaggressions in every situation, but those with real or perceived privilege should call attention to them using tactics such as humor to diffuse and teach at the same time. At the very least, we can do seemingly innocuous but impactful things like using she and he pronouns interchangeably when writing (although I’ll admit I always use “she”), so that others read what we write and stop normalizing an all-male world.

> [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
* This was a great and thought-provoking session. I found the exercise to be really powerful. I continued thinking about ways we can avoid becoming segregated silos of squares and triangles. We can demand diversity and/or at least draw attention to all-male/all-white conferences. We can encourage and support people of color or traditionally marginalized groups (esp if you’re in at the majority or perceived to be) to volunteer for speaking gigs, etc. We can support organizations that teach kids of color to code by volunteering to be a TA or other role to help encourage learning—-in that way you’re also providing access to opportunity. Seek out diversity and point out areas where there aren’t enough women, people of color, etc. Ask why that is. All the research points to the higher success of diverse teams anyway, so we need to continue to push for healthy discussion about difference and equity.

> [Choose your own adventure](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/)
* I went to the session on Universal Basic Income (UBI). Fascinating topic that I am generally in favor of after spending some time after the session researching it. Seems that discussion about automation is promoting more discussion about UBI these days. I was a little taken aback by what discussion during our session about the concept of “not working”—-for those on the far left/lower end of a very loose proposed UBI income scale we examined—-revealed about the attitudes of some people toward the working poor and non-working poor in general, such as the myth that people are poor because they do not work or work hard enough or are lazy. With a likely superfluous workforce in our future due to increasing automation of a long list of jobs (including attorneys!!), I believe that, if we do UBI right, using the economic benefits generated by the savings auomation will provide us to cover the basic needs of all citizens will leave the door open for more innovation, access to opportunity, opportunity to take risks, and more money flowing back into our economy as well as address and possibly alleviate issues like poverty and homelessness that are a drain on public and private resources and cause great harm to the humans and communities experiencing each reality.


## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
* This mod, I wrote and published a post on the Turing Blog about imposter syndrome. I co-lead the Turing imposters lunch support group.
[link to blog post](https://www.turing.io/blog/2017/05/02/feeling-fraud-get-thee-turing-imposters-lunch)
* I also paired with mod1 and mod2 students several times.

#### **Posse**
* I participated in the Wozniak Posse (although I found it difficult to go to all of the posse meetings as they often conflicted with spikes I wanted to attend, such as a women-only whiteboarding technical interview prep spike that was amazing.
* Learning more about algorithms and getting technical interview practice is my favorite part of participating in Wozniak.

#### **Playing a Part**

* In addition to co-leading the Imposters Lunch support group, I also started a daily “7-minute-workout” physical fitness group activity to encourage students to get moving for at least 7 minutes. We also started doing some longer workouts and running using a Couch to 5K app as our “trainer” for those who wanted more than 7 minutes.
