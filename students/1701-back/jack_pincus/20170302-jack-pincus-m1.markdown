# Jack Pincus - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coding in ruby to create IOT devices. I want to be able to make a product that solves an old problem in a new way.

#### Notes


*   Note 1: TDD in Night Writer was unable to execute due to an input file that was misnamed when we cleaned up our test data before turning in. We used TDD throughout the project, and going back 1 commit or changing the input file path makes it functional again.


## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Nicholas Jacques):

### From Nick
Strengths
+ Really strong ability to turn algorthimic concepts into functional code.  I could suggest an idea and you would quickly implement it in the program.
+ Great time management, time spent coding was focused with few distractions.  
+ We figured out a basic github workflow. No catastrophes.
+ File IO master.
+ Overall a really positive pairing experience.

Opportunities for Improvement
+ Slow down and commit to TDD. We both struggled with this and probably enabled each other in neglecting it.  Once we tried to implement we made good progress.  We both clearly have a lot more too learn about TDD.
+ You might be able to combat overly-complicated-method syndrome by talking through these methods with your pair.  You have an impressive ability to make it "do the thing" but there were a few methods in our project that I never really got a full grasp of how they worked.  As you mentioned, I definitely should have been more proactive about speaking up when that occurred.

### To Nick
1. 3 strengths
  + Great code organization and eye for detail
  + Communicating and being flexible in terms of time management was really good. I never felt like time was being wasted on this project, and I felt like we were pretty efficient with each-other's time
  + Ability to work paired was great, especially at the end. It felt cumbersome to use ping-pong TDD methods, but it ended up working out faster than the first half of the project which was way more laissez faire
  + git
  + keeping up with what the other was thinking and clarifying when there was confusion

2. 3 areas of improvement
  + It would have been better if we had been able to get to coding earlier instead of waiting later in the week. I feel like this was a mutual thing
  + Learning to really use TDD would have been a great thing. Coming into this project, it felt like we both had a bad grasp of TDD, and at the end it felt like we had a basic grasp that really helped the second half of the project
  + Speak up more when your partner starts making things way too complicated

*   Project 2 Mark VA:

### From Mark
+ Really enjoyed working on this project with you.  While we started slowly given our weekend activities, once back at school we got after it in a very methodical way.  I'm astounded by your knack for ORMs and the mental mapping to follow every object so easily.  I get it with time but takes some processing, you seem to get it instantly!  No real work flow issues and I believe that it would require working on a harder project to tease out any differences in work style/collaboration. As long as the work is well within our current aptitudes there isn't a whole lot of flailing.  I appreciated the breaking up of ownership of code when the spec allowed for it and driver/navigation switching.

### To Mark

#### Areas for improvement:
+ Stop and read the error message closely. It is really tempting to jump ahead and fix what you think might be the problem, but often this is not the problem.
+ Time management: We are both guilty on this front. It would have been a lot less stressful if we had managed our time a little better. It worked out in the end, but I think my takeaway for this is that its better to frontload the work.
#### Already Mastered:
+ Working in a team. We were able to really effectively divide and conquer on this project. It was really nice working with you, since you always stayed positive, got the work done, and knew what it was that needed doing.
+ Shortcuts. I can't believe how well you can navigate around any computer. I really need to practice after seeing how you work on your, and my computer.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1
Growth Mindset: In this session we talked about growth mindset vs fixed minset. Growth mindset is a way of thinking, and encouraging others to think in a way that encourages thoughts that lead to lifetime learning and expanding capabilities. Fixed mindset is a way of thinking that sees learning as heaving an endpoint, and the learning itself as the end ratgher than the newfoiund knowledge used to accomplish something.

#### Session 2
Getting better at difficult things. This session pointed out that the brain is often very efficient at parsing difficult tasks without active instruction. As far as I can tell the important part about

#### Session 3
Stress. this session we talked about the triggers of stress, as well as the responses and actions that people can take to deal with stress. The important takeaway for me was that managing stress is critical, but even mor ecritical is managing stress in ways that are healthy for me and my world.

#### Session 4
Shared values: This session we talked about the common ground that we can all find despite different backgrounds and beliefs. It was nice to see that we are all from different places and backgrounds and still have a common thread amongst ourselves.

#### Session 5
Debugging the gender gap. Watched a documentary about the gender imbalance in workplaces in technology. Afterwards discussed the ways that all tech workers can make impacts in this area. Ideas we came up with include working to make the pipeline of applicants in tech is broadened and raising awareness actively.

### Community Participation
Participated in the Turing Lab Posse, and was invited to present my side project during a spike.

-------------------------------------------------------------

## Final Review

*   Strong group projects, independent projects
*   Overall solid contributions to the cohort; continue to refine leadership role

### Outcome
