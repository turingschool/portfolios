# Beth Knight - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For this mod, I wanted to focus on using TDD to drive my projects. I also wanted to learn good git habits and killer CRUD.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post:
 [Fashionable Forms](http://www.bethknight.com/beths-blog)

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
Blogger and Mix Master were really great CRUD intros. I still refer back to them when I’m working on my new projects. I wish I had had more time to build out all the extra features.

#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project

Job tracker was a really great reference as well. I wish I had more time/structure for my mini project. I was pretty much copying Mixmaster but using bunnies.


## C: Group Work & Projects

 **Bike Share** In this project you'll use Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco. This application will collect data in two ways: 1) through web forms allowing users to enter trip/station/weather information, and 2) by consuming CSV files with historical information for stations, trips, and weather. In addition to creating and storing this information for viewing at a later date, this application will provide a number of user dashboards with higher level analysis of trends in bike share usage.


 **Little Shop of Orders**
Little Shop was the biggest group I had worked with. It was good practice for seeing what the work flow might be like in the real world.
In this project you'll use Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering. I really liked my group. We didn't break it up, but spent the whole time brainstorming. I think it helped our project go really smoothly and everyone was on the same page.

##### Feedback to me for Little Shop

  From Colleen: Beth, I really enjoyed working with you on our Little Shop project. You have a great understanding of rails and working through errors. I appreciate your willingness to try anything when things weren’t working as we expected and to ask for help from your mentors.   I think this was really beneficial to our project! Your energy and positivity was a huge asset to our success and to keep us all smiling! I also think your CSS skills are awesome and really helped to take our project to the next level. Overall, I think you were a great partner and I’m really proud of our project and how our group worked together.

  From Craig: Beth, it was great to finally have a chance to work with you after not having the opportunity for most of the first mod. I was really impressed with your work ethic, and you were always willing and able to try out new ideas. Having that kind of team member who can generate solutions in a group is really valuable when we’re stuck and trying to come up with new ways to attack a problem. You were also always willing to drive, and your positive demeanor helped to make the long hours in the basement enjoyable. Thanks for the great group project experience, and good luck in the next mod!

  From Sergey :It’s been a pleasure to work with Beth. She has done a great design work for this project. She is good in applying different tools like Factory Girl and Faker. She considers and applies different strategies in solving problems. Great communication and collaboration.


## D: Professional Skills

 Just tryin' to get paid.

#### **Professional Development Workshops**
> [Warm Outreach, Agile Process, Feedback](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-b/beth_knight.md)

#### **Gear Ups**

[Empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)
Empathy allows me to understand other people while I maintain healthy boundaries. The most recent example of this was in the recent election. I was liberal living in a red state and it was difficult to have discussions that didn’t turn into screaming matches. But by having empathy and listening to other people’s viewpoints, we were able to see each other’s point of view. This didn’t mean we convinced one another to change our positions, but it turned a fight into a productive discussion.>

[Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
We brainstormed things that fill me with purpose.  Picture myself as a programmer working in a company. Find small wins that help push me through week. Imagine a big project I want to build, and how learning all this will help.

[Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
It was interesting that so many people in a programming school were anti technology. I was at the front of the line because I see all the ways it can benefit society. I see it as a great equalizer and a solution to our environmental problems.>


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Bike Share

  For Sam. Sam is an incredibly responsible and this made him a great project manager. He kept us focused and working when we started to get too silly. He’s also a very strong programmer. And as a person, he’s a great listener. Our team was definitely better off for having him on it.

  For Mark. Mark is incredibly fun to work with. I really enjoyed talking through problems with him. We’re both pretty extroverted so we got along really well. We probably need someone to keep us focused because we got off track quite a bit. He’s a great collaborator and he knows his CRUD.

  For Chris. Chris always showed up ready to work. He was always ready to drive when we were pair programming. I think he got quiet when things started moving fast, and so my only feedback would be to speak up more.

##### Feedback from me for Little Shop

  For Craig. Craig is really fun to work with. We had to do long hours for this project and he was always cheerful and ready to work. He drove and navigated. He was our project manager and made sure to keep us on track and do stand ups every day.

  For Sergey. Sergey really tackled the design side of our project. It looks amazing because of the work he did. He also volunteered to drive a lot. Open communication, great teammate.

  For Colleen. Colleen is an amazing programmer and she kept our group on track. She stayed late and worked all weekend. She even brought jelly beans when we had to work all day on Easter. Awesome teammate.

#### **Posse**
  Armstrong. We did data analysis of people who died on the Titanic. Morbid/cool.
  It was fun to play around with code with no outcomes required.
  Posses teach you how to work with other people.

#### **Playing a Part**

  I’ve signed up to be one of the incoming Turing students point person.
