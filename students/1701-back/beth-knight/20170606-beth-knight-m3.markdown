# Beth Knight - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to focus on creating and consuming APIs. I also wanted to work on advanced SQL queries

This mod was a challenge for me, but a good one. I'm excited to build projects in the future using my own APIs.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**

A clone of Github.

This was my first time consuming an API, and I really enjoying accessing an outside resource.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**

This project is an API sales data analysis tool. The return format for all endpoints is JSON.

I found the advanced SQL challenging, especially converting it back into ActiveRecord queries. Really great learning experience though.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://fair-bnb.herokuapp.com/)**
>*  Clone of Airbnb

  It was my first time working with an all female team, and I loved it. It helped me realize how important it is to communicate with your group thoroughly during the planning phase. This really helps avoid problems further down the road.

 Clone of Thumbtack

 I struggled with consuming my own endpoints. I think it was exacerbated by the fact that it was a brown field project and I kept running into unforseen errors like a broken pro user log in. It was still a really great experience, especially since it was a brown field project. I think if I had more time and talked more with the previous team it could have gone much smoother.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

 This made me rethink a lot of different comments people have said to me. The thing I hear the most is, "You don't look like a programmer." It's little comments like this that make me doubt myself. I know it's usually not the intention of whoever is saying it, but it kind of reinforces the false belief that I don't belong.

> [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

We had a really interesting talk about this in class. We got into quotas and whether or not that was an effective way to handle the low diversity ratio in the tech industry. I was for it. I think companies can start to force change and it's an effective way to do it. It's a company taking a stand and saying, this is the kind of workforce we want.

> [Choose your own adventure](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/)

I was in Oklahoma for this talk. But I was giving my own talk at a tech conference called 200ok. I live coded making a custom view in iOS in front of over 140 tech professionals. It was nerve wracking and the reason I'm behind this mod, but I'm really proud of myself for taking the risk.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**

I paired with a frontend student, Marissa, to help her build a backend for a trail finder Tinder type app. We're still working on it. It's super exciting to work with someone who knows Javascript really well and it's a fun idea.

#### **Posse**

I like the Armstrong posse because the we get to play with Python, and it's fun seeing a new language and how you can bounce around between different ones.

#### **Playing a Part**

I work with the frontend and actively seek to hang out with them. I even got the nickname "token backend", which I'm not a fan of.
