## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

[Link](http://example.com) to DTR Memo from 1 paired project.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (First Last): Dear Beth,

I loved working with you on this project. I felt like we shared a similar approach to how to tackle the problem and it paid off with a successful and satisfying assessment. I appreciate your commitment to me as your partner and to this project.

Your strengths include:
	Super positive
	Flexible attitude
	Easy going
	Resourceful (you are very good at finding answers, and getting unstuck and finding help when needed!)
	Creative approach to testing and coding
	Patient

One thing to improve on (and we talked about this), is your approach to "throwing spaghetti" on the wall, but I think you advocated for yourself really well in asking to focus on TDD.

Awesome all around!
