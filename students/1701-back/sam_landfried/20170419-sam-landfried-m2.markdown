# Sam Landfried - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In Mod 1, I was in 'explore' mode. I maximized my exposure to everything Turing had to offer. In Mod 2, I used my time to more intentionally focus on the areas that I decided were high value. Specifically, this means I spent a lot of time developing my TDD skills, working with my posse to study data structures and fleshing out my online, professional presence.

This mod I learned that you really can't do it all. I had to make some hard decisions about what areas to focus on at the exclusion of others to keep myself from overloading. Case in point, I had to give up early morning meditation because that extra hour of sleep is more valuable.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post:
[Clean up your views for glory and profit.](https://gist.github.com/samlandfried/ced21b9eb02d9275d3435716d98d28f0#file-refactor_your_views-md)

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
Creating nested paths for comments on Blogger was a valuable experience. It made it clear why nesting paths is discouraged (Because the challenge of tracking associated IDs for the paths quickly becomes overwhelming). The Tagging aspect of Blogger was also valuable since it was good practice with CRUD in a many-to-many relationship. Mix Master felt like more of the same, and I'm not sure what the unique take away from that project was supposed to be.

#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
Job Tracker was a fun challenge. It was essentially the same as Blogger and Mix Master, but I attempted to do it without following the tutorial, and it helped solidify some of these patterns. The valuable take away from the mini project was that you really can't overestimate how long a project is going to take. I planned to create a complex, massive project, and there just wasn't enough time to do that over a weekend.


## C: Group Work & Projects

**Bike Share**

* Bike Share is a project that focuses on building out CRUD functionality for bike sharing stations in San Francisco. The project starts with a real dataset from SF's bike share program, and it is our job to create an interface to interat with that data.

* What a beast this project was. Collaborating with three people is a challenge. Working with a giant dataset is a challenge. Using ActiveRecord effectively is a challenge. Keeping logic out of views is a challenge. I think I put more time into this project than any other. It was valuable in that it helped me identify some of the things I didn't understand about web development.

**Little Shop of Orders**
* We built an e-commerce site that had varying levels of access for admins, users and visitors. It also had a shopping cart with the ability to checkout.
* We all take Amazon's functionality for granted, so it was helpful to have to reason out some of that functionality. Like, how can you populate a cart as a visitor then log in and retain access to that cart? It's helpful to have an understanding of that process.

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share

* From Beth:
Sam is an incredibly responsible and this made him a great project manager. He kept us focused and working when we started to get too silly. He’s also a very strong programmer. And as a person, he’s a great listener. Our team was definitely better off for having him on it.

* From Mark Van Akkeren:
in retrospective you did a fantastic job at the PM organization.  While i bristled with what seemed like over kill at times it was good to always be on the same page and always have good communication lines open.  I have taken a lot away from that and totally will be applying elements in future groups.

##### Feedback to me for Little Shop

* From Jonathan:
I very much enjoyed and appreciated pairing with you - your methodical approach to TDD and your flexibility on the eventual solution was especially constructive, and you personally helped me see even more value in the TDD and pairing processes. We as a team benefitted from your logical mind, and your bringing creative solutions to the challenges of the project. The only area you might focus on in the future is setting boundaries on your time, both for your own benefit and that of the group. Your energy and concentration is a real asset, but can also be difficult for others to keep up with. Overall, I am really glad we finally had the chance to work together, and would hope to again in the future.

* From Maria Stenquist:
Sam, it was a great learning experience for me to finally have you as a team member. You set out to learn as much as you could in this project, and I think you did a good job balancing your own learning objectives with those of the rest of the team. You were dedicated to the project, as well as the team, and while you kept the scope of the project in mind, you were never afraid to dive into the nitty gritty details of the code. I think this skill will immensely serve you as a developer. During our project, you did an awesome job with juggling other commitments, such as your work with Wozniak Posse and arranging a lecture on Beth's job-hunt process (which was a great lecture, I got a lot out of it) as well as side-projects (something about working in Java?), so you are always thinking two-steps ahead. Having said this, while you conceptually and technically were very strong in driving forward the objectives of the project, I noticed a couple times where other members of the group had valuable input that was not given credence to at that point, but later surfaced as being relevant. Otherwise, I am hard-pressed to think of any other constructive feedback as you were an excellent teammate, and I really appreciated our pairing sessions (especially on RSpec!) as they helped to synthesize several concepts for me. Thanks for making yourself available to pair, and it is clear you have a knack for teaching, which is a super valuable skill to have. I foresee you going on to doing great things as a developer, and hopefully we get to work together again soon.


## D: Professional Skills

#### **Professional Development Workshops**
[Warm Outreach, Agile Process, Feedback](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-b/sam_landfried.md)

#### **Gear Ups**

[Empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)
It is difficult to enter 'empathy' mode to give valuable feedback, but it is a skill we're all working on. Where it gets _really_ challenging is incorporating empathy into _all_ of our interactions. Practicing mindful communication is not a human's natural communication style, but it helps us collaborate better and create a better environment for everyone we share it with.

[Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
Grit is a limited resource. We can randomly apply our grit without much thought, and we will waste it. The trick is to identify a task worthy of your grit. It is our grit that will carry us through challenging times to glory.

[Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
Jobs get automated out. The US workforce is made up of ~4% farmers, compared to ten times that number half a century ago. This has the unfortunate side effect of squeezing people out of 'middle-skill' jobs, to the extremes of 'high-skill' work, or 'low-skill' work that exists to serve the highly skilled. One take away from that is: Always be skilled. The other is, we need to make systemic decisions to protect those that are not highly skilled.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Bike Share

* For Mark van Akkeren:
Hi Mark,

I’m glad we got to work together on this project. It was a valuable experience to build a project together like we did, and I’m proud of the result. Thank you for your part in that. It also was a cool experience staying up until well past midnight on Wednesday night with you. It felt good to be finishing it together when all the sane people had gone to sleep. In our evaluation with Beth, you actually identified the area I’d like to give some constructive feedback on. She asked you to describe your least favorite part of the project, and you said you were going to respond like a politician and not answer that question directly. This was a pattern I noticed a few times during our collaboration, and I think it might be counterproductive in some situations. So, my suggestion is to practice active listening and respond to the question that actually was asked. That being said, it was a valuable experience for me to work with someone with a different work style from my own, so thank you for that.

All the best,
Sam

* For Beth Knight:
Hey Beth,

It was nice to work with you and get to know you a bit better during our collaboration. You bring levity to a group, which is a relief in a stressful project like Bike Share. I’m also glad you unleashed your inner designer a bit on our project. I shudder to think of what it would have looked like had I been left to handle that. I want to mention testing as a potential area for improvement in your next collaboration. You definitely write tests well and are good about practicing a real TDD workflow. The area I see for improvement (At least in a collaborative environment) is how you react to tests failing. This may sound funny, but when we were running tests together, it was actually causing me a little bit of anxiety because I knew if the test failed you were going to get frustrated with it. I only mention this because I think it would be an easy adjustment and could make future testing relationships smoother. On an aside, I’m impressed by your initiative to find a job, and you inspired me to get started on my own job hunt. So thanks for that!

Best,
Sam

* For Chris Dale:
Hey Chris,

It was nice to get to know you better while working on Bike Share. Also, I appreciated your work effort. It was easy to concentrate on the task at hand with you. I want to applaud the grit you displayed while tackling one of the later methods in the trips dashboard (I forget which one in particular). It was a challenge, but you kept grinding away at it. I think in those situations you’ll benefit yourself if you break the code down, piece by piece, and check every assumption you’re making about the code. What value does this method call return? Is this enumerator really doing what I think it is? This attention to detail might be tedious, but it will help you identify problems (and then solve them) quicker. You’re super easy to get along with, and I’m looking forward to continuing to work with you throughout the mod. Feel free to hit me up if you ever want another pair of eyes on your code.

Best,
Sam

##### Feedback from me for Little Shop
* For Jonathan Kidd:
You're an excellent partner, and it has been a delight collaborating with you. You're always engaged, focused, levelheaded and nice. I especially appreciated your interest in engaging in a real pair programming dynamic. I think it was a good learning opportunity for both of us to express our technical ideas out loud. You also helped me come to a personal realization when you urged the group to claim ownership of our time. We were in a spot where we couldn't make scheduling decisions because everyone kept saying, "Anything is fine for me," and it would have been much easier had one of us just said, "I need these hours off." I encourage you to continue pointing out issues with group workflow. I don't have much to offer in terms of constructive feedback since it seems like you're doing a good job technically and collaboratively. You can be soft spoken at times, and while that wasn't a problem in our group, I can imagine a scenario where you get steam rolled and that would be unfortunate for that group, since your opinion is obviously more important than that hypothetical jerk that is steam rolling you. Anyways, this project has really been a great experience for me, in large part because of your influence on the group, so thank you!

* For Maria Stenquist:
I'm glad we got to finally work in a group together! You're easy to get along with, committed to the work and kind. In short, an asset to any group you're on. I admire how you seem to have a dozen irons in the fire and somehow never get stressed out. Specifically, during our time working together, you were visiting friends in the hospital, studying RSpec, spearheading the styling decisions, leading a posse and engaging the job hunt more directly than anyone else in our cohort. Amazing! While staying busy is obviously a fantastic character trait, I think it might occassionally interfere with effective coding. I believe concentrating on a single process of your application is helpful for debugging, and I noticed at times you were making decisions based on your personal assumptions and beliefs, not based on what the code was telling you. So, you're probably tired of hearing it, but my advice is: Slow down. Identify your assumptions. Confirm those assumptions. And that's it! Looking forward to working together in the future. And I still owe you a data structures lesson! Open invitation.

* For Danny Radden:
Hey Brah. I'm glad we finally got to work together! You're a lot of fun, and I'm glad we've had the chance to become friends at Turing. But anyhoo. You were a boon to the group: You contributed a strong technical skillset, a dedication to outcomes and a friendly disposition. It was nice of you to help Riley with our navbar, too. I noticed you have a tendency to research a challenge independently and discover a solution on your own before talking through an issue with the group. Self reliance is certainly a valuable skill, but there were times when I felt like we weren't really collaborating. I think you could be a more effective collaborator if you talk through your ideas and make sure your teammates are on the same page. Doing things that way is slower, no doubt, but I like to believe it leads to better outcomes. You should also probably learn VIM. You've helped me learn a lot about my own collaboration style, and challenged me to be a better partner, which I honestly appreciate, and am hopefully making (slow) progress on. I hope we get more chances to work together in the future.

#### **Posse**
I was one of the leaders/founders of Wozniak Posse, affectionately known as Woz Poz. Our goal is to close the gap between ourselves and CS grads. The other posse leads and I organized a weekly class on different data structures. We did whiteboarding, code alongs and lectures. We received solid feedback from participants, so I feel like we did a good job. I learned a lot about collaboration and my own limits. And data structures.

#### **Playing a Part**
I was a posse lead. My posse organized a guest speaker for students. I made the lunch roulette bot. I paired frequently with lower mod students. I do my best to offer meaningful feedback during retros.
