## D: Professional Skills

#### **Professional Development Workshops**
> [Resume, Turing Portfolio, Flower, Trello, Mod-4-Plan](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-b/<Sergey_Lukyanenko.md>)

#### **Gear Ups**

> [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
* Because of microaggression weâ€™ve been pushing people away from the tech industry for decades, and this immense loss of talent is both absurd and embarrassing.

> [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
* After playing with Parable of the polygons, I gave answers to some questions:
Let's say tech executives (consciously or subconsciously) seek teams in which at least 1/3 of team members are like them (gender, age, race). How will this impact the types of jobs available?
I think it will create an environment mostly consisted with th same gender, age, race the executives are.
This game demonstrates how unconsciously we can create segregated environment.

> [Choose your own adventure](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/)
* How perception of a person, country or an event can be modified through a story. And how important to tell stories to change the perception. In the question: "What are some single stories around the tech industry?" most of us were agree that we didn't know much about what's going on in the industry in general and with women in particular before we watched and discussed it at Turin school. So to have this discussions are very beneficial.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Posse**
  >* I participated in Jennifer Pahlka posse over the module
  >* We used workshop and meeting time to talk about strategic components of projects, then groups can split up based on interests to execute the tech side of projects.
