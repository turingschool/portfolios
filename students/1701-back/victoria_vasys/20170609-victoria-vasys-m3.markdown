# Victoria Vasys - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> I didn't fully know what to expect this module, but wanted to strengthen my Rails skills and start to explore more advanced techniques & some front-end complexities.

## Self-Assessment

| Section | Category | Score (optional) |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 3.5 |
| B | **Individual Work & Projects** | 3 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 4 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 3.5 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 4 |

>* This mod was incredibly challenging as the workload, range of topics, difficulty, and professional development requirements all ramped up greatly compared to Mod 2. I really enjoyed the learning and was very pleased that I got to focus on what I wanted to for my individual contribution to group projects, but at the same time, there wasn't enough opportunity to practice all of the really interesting & useful things we explored. It would be really beneficial if we could try to pull a few classes/practice pieces (eg. email, background workers, jquery) back to Mod 2 where things are fairly relaxed & multiple classes repeat.
>* I assessed myself at a 3 in for Individual Work & Projects because I didn't make it as far on APIcurious as I would have liked & should have spent more time & effort practicing SQL on my own. I assessed myself sub-4 for PD because although I spent quite a bit of time on most facets, I didn't spend enough time actually researching companies, reaching out to people for coffees, or generally networking. I'm going to try to put together an alumni-student get-together either over break or at the beginning of next mod.

-----------------------


## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
>* A Ruby on Rails project to practice working with data from public APIs; it attempts to emulate a simplified version of GitHubâ€™s existing UI using its API. Uses the OAuth protocol to authenticate users through the third-party provider, and uses various testing techniques to allow testing against the third-party data.
>* This was a really great project to start getting my feet wet with consuming APIs; I didn't get as far as I would have liked but spent the majority of my time exploring new testing opportunities, which I'm thankful I did. It would have been helpful to have gotten a roadshow of best practices before the practice exam in which we were expected to speed through the process.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)** 
>* Our first Turing School Mod 3 project: We demonstrate mastery of our Rails skills, built single-responsibility controllers to provide a well-designed and versioned API, developed controller tests to drive design, and implemented ActiveRecord methods & SQL queries to perform complicated business intelligence.
>* We compromised functionality for thorough TDD and paid for it during our eval. I was pretty proud of our accomplishments considering the timeframe and how ill I felt at the very beginning of the mod, but I will be revisiting it to develop better testing & to practice SQL & ActiveRecord.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1: Fairbnb](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/prompts/airbnb)** 
>* The purpose of this project was to build a multi-tenancy, mostly secure & best-practice Rails app using Agile processes to emulate the functionality and design of some major websites. For Fairbnb, we built complex search queries, reservation capabilities & internal APIs, consumed external APIs, developed live-messaging through websockets, and finely-tuned the front-end to have a professional and aesthetic UI.
>* This was a gruelling, yet thrilling adventure with a stellar team of all females. I dug into websockets and Action Cable, which were totally new to me & it was really satisfying to get that to function. I also had a really good time putting on the finishing touches to our styling.

> Rales Engine evaluation comments:
* Testing is sub-par and wouldn't be acceptable on the job
* General code quality is solid
* SQL queries are functional and complete

> Cloney Island Sprint 1 evaluation comments:
* Messages in chat persist!!!!
* There could be more testing on the models (validations and methods) so keep that in mind!
* There is a little bit of logic in the view that could be pulled into the controller (conversations index). Really nice job, overall!

## C: Gear Ups

> [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
The microagressions conversation was highly interesting and important. I was very thankful Sal & Ilana were our leaders because they encouraged open & respectful conversation and inspired us to face some harsh realities. As we spoke about our personal experiences, I came to realize that my response to microagressions is completely variant based on my current mood and tolerance. Sometimes I am quick to make others aware of their misstep and stand up for myself, and other times I am either down-trodden, low-energy or wary of saying something considering the consequences (fear of violent retaliation or tender work environments). It was really fascinating and somewhat comforting hearing from others in my class and very useful exploring articles and realistic instances of microagressions.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* [Portfolio Template](https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios/blob/master/BEM3_template.md) - I developed this open-source template for my fellow students to easily construct their portfolios from. 
>* [Turing Podcast](http://turingschool.libsyn.com/) - I have produced & hosted or co-hosted a total of 7 episodes so far; 4 this mod & 3 last mod. I have explored the experiences of students from both the front-end & back-end programs of each mod and discussed the job hunt process, ins-and-outs of technical interviews, what it means to be a mentee and mentor, and how to progress and excel as a junior developer with various Turing grads. I plan to record an episode or two over break and aim to hone-in on more specific topics & groups of people (veterans, moms, lgbtq, block-chain, React, Elixir/Phoenix; would love ideas on this!)

#### **Armstrong Posse**
  >* I helped coordinate people into research teams using a trello board & contributed to discussion about the goals & future of the posse; I helped dig in to some code from former students who used Solidity and the test block chain in a final project. I will be co-leading the posse next mod.
  >* It was really neat participating in a variety of events with Armstrong; we watched TED talks, had group discussions on the potentials and pitfalls of the block chain, students led lightning talks & tutorial walk-throughs to learn more about the intricacies of using Solidity and Ethereum, a former student outlined how his team's Rails-React-Solidity project worked and let us explore it in-depth, and the posse is connecting with real programmers & meetups that focus on block-chain technologies (we'll be assisting with a future block-chain hack-a-thon led by the Ethereum meetup)
  >* It's been an invaluable experience working with people across mods and connecting with people outside of Turing through Armstrong. The channel is very active, and we set out to coordinate a happy hour & be involved in a meetup organization. I'm very excited to see where next mod leads!

#### **Playing a Part**

> I've attended multiple imposter lunches & try to help support struggling students whenever possible. I have contributed to multiple potlucks to encourage & bolster cohort cohesion and health. I've participated in the after-class work-outs & running and encourage others to get up off their tush! :)
