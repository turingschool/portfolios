### Pair Feedback

#### Feedback from partner projects.

##### Night Writer (Joseph Glass):
> Hello Diana. The first thing I noticed working with you was your incredible energy and drive. You're willing to put as much research and time into learning a skill as it takes. You brought a lot of organization to our project and always ensured we knew how tasks were divided and assigned when we  closed for the day. I particularly admire how you tackle every challenge no matter its scope. You helped me go from zero Github knowledge to Github competent. Occasionally, you get sidetracked into researching more complicated methods instead of looking at the basic ones first. If you ask yourself "how do I need to change this specific data?" and "what will do that?", you might find that you can do more with basic methods like .delete, .push, and .each than you expected. You're a big picture person, which is often advantageous, but sometimes the problem is too big to hold in mind at once. Using irb to focus on one small problem until it's fixed can chip away at those "big problems".

#### Black Thursday (Jonathan Kidd):
> Diana - I have learned so much working with you on this project. I really appreciate your tenacity and willingness and ability to put in long hours to understand the material and get the work done, and also being proactive in mapping out the relationships and pivoting the data to make sense of it all. The pseudocoding you did from going through the spec helped us break down the pieces when we were still trying to get our heads around the interaction model. Your explanation of your learning and work style helped me understand how best to approach the project as a team. I feel that our issues at the outset allowed us to tackle the project from different angles, and getting experience working with people who are different than us (and also very alike in some ways!). More clear communication on what you would like to divide up and conquer versus work through together would improve workflow. Thank you for the time and energy you devoted to this project."
