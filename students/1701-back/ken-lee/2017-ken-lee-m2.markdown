Areas of Emphasis

I plan on just keeping up with learning all the new information that's going to come my way on top of all the Ruby I had last module. I want to also do better on focusing on purposeful learning because of the limited time I have as a husband and father of three. I know I have less time than most students at Turing and I want to be mindful of that and use that to help me focus on making sure I spend my time wisely. At the same time I will not sacrifice my family in the pursuit career happiness. I know there is a balance and my goal is to find that balance. With this balance I believe I will be able to learn all that is necessary to become a well rounded developer.

Bike Share

Description: Bike Share was one of the biggest project I've ever been a part of and I learned the use of Sinatra and ActiveRecord along with all the Ruby I learned the previous module. This project involved using open-source data of all the data collected from the San Francisco bike share program. It was pretty amazing how we could use this data. To be able to figure out how to grab data we needed and to modify that data.

Takeaways: I also learned how speaking up makes a difference and feeling comfortable with not know everything.

Empathy <3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently>
Empathy has alway been something I was aware of. I feel like that is a trait I am lucky to be conicous of naturally. I think the teaching of it is important because not everyone is aware. To understand where people come from is important because it helps you become a better communicator. Though I feel like I am good at this I have found I am always learning to be better at it. To catch my bias's. I'm aware that sometimes I can be a bit strong on how I want to express my views.

Grit - How did your grit come into play? Thinking about long-term future goals that I am passionate about. Looking ahead to the idea of working on projects that I find interesting, and am passionate about. Turing is part of the journey to achieving those goals. Have you been able to strengthen your grit (or your grittiness) in your time at Turing?

I still have issues with the definition of grit. I find it hard to digest the "Passion" part. I've heard that use so many times and I feel like it's too broad and too either like. I think this is based on my personal view of I don't know what my passion is/are. I worry about the idea of grit pushing people into believing they can do anything because not everyone can. Turing ask people to leave if they feel the student is not showing progress and that makes me wonder if that person is not capable of learning coding. But that is only because I consider Turing staff to be professionals and their opinions are based on fact. I'm not sure if my grit is any stronger than before I came to Turing.

Automation
This is an interesting concept, and I think it will be something that will continue to follow humanity in the future. Just as computers have become commonplace, and have become a necessity for a large subset of people that go to work everyday and turn on their computers/laptops, there may be robots/other automatic processes that become part of every day life.

I think that this is only an issue if the people who run the world only think of everything as black and white. That the only out come is to cut out more people with out a plan for the ones that are cut. Not just saying that people will learn new better skills to make better wages. Fact is there are people who won't and those people will suffer. I believe that there are more people who will suffer than benefit from automation with out plans to better support the ones that are cut. I think society would fall apart if Automation is just to benefit the few versus the many.

Giving Feedback

Feedback from me for Bike Share

For <Sergey>: Sergey, I'm glad we had an opportunity to work on a project together. You always kept on the positive side and always wanted to learn. You took the opportunity to say I don't know and can you explain what's going on. Those moments helped me learn more because I was thinking the same thing but did not ask. You willingness to take on hard problems and keep on it until it was completed is admirable.  

For <Riley>: Riley, I think you are a really talented team member. I know we would not of gotten to where were on the project if it wasn't for you. You knowledge and calmness helped keep me level headed. I especially found your willingness to listen to feedback and take action inspiring. We team talked about how we could do better with you teaching us and you did. You slowed down for us and walked us through some really complex stuff. I also learned to that I should speak up more and earlier on because you taught me the benefits of using one of my strengths - communication. I look forward to getting the opportunity to work with you again. Thank you!!!

Playing a Part

I have contributed to the Turing community through being an active member of the Turing Diversity group. I made it a part of my time here at Turing because I believe I can make a difference in our community by helping making it more diverse and helping our diverse population feel at home. I have helped a few students get grants with my experience getting grants by guiding them on how the process works. I still wish I could make a bigger difference by helping more students with the grant process.
