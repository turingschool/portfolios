## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post:
 [BlogPostGist](https://gist.github.com/dannyradden/328a0a7a97066bf660bac6f8e10c9002)

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
These projects were both tutorial driven projects. They were pretty slow going, because of all the testing involved, but in the end they were valuable. They were really helpful in learning about CRUD. Blogger in particular was a good intro into rails.

#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
Job Tracker and the Rails Mini Project were both independent unguided projects done in rails. My Mini Project was called 'League Manager' and was an app that managed sports leagues, teams, and their players. Both of these projects were useful in learning about different ways to set up relationships between tables and objects.


## C: Group Work & Projects

 **Bike Share**:

In Bike Share we used Sinatra to make a web app that analyzes bike share usage. Bike share was a great exercise to learn active record methods and relationships. It was interesting to see how much faster the database queries occurred when only using active record methods over a mixture of ActiveRecord and ruby methods. This project was also helpful in learning the MVC model and how to use Github effectively as a collaboration tool.

 **Little Shop of Orders**:

 For our little shop project we made an online commerce platform for selling hybrid animals using rails and active record. Our shop is called the 'Mythical Mingled Emporium.' This was a very helpful in learning rails. I also learned quite a bit about rails and the asset pipeline. Our group worked well together and we ended up with a functional website.

**Bike Share evaluation comments:**

-You've gained a pretty deep understanding of the power of AR; share that knowledge! (spike, post-class session)

-It's pretty expertly divided; the controller is dry (pushed most logic to models), should look into extracting POROS (classes/modules that don't correspond to tables/db; could extract a math module, and a parser to package params to pass into models

-Can clean up validations to be all part of one validates function in models.

-In future projects, be more aware of individual commits; commit often & split up driving responsibilities. (evaluation scores)

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share

  **From Brett:** Danny, it was a pleasure working with you on this project. Back in Mod1, we didn’t get to many opportunities to work together so i’m glad we were able to work together on a project to kick off Mod2. I really enjoyed pairing with you while building out the CRUD functionality of our trips entity. I thought we found a great rhythm switching duties between feature/model testing and building out the controller/views. Throughout the project, I thought you did a great job of getting our team over the ‘hump’ when we were faced with a challenge we weren’t familiar with. For example, when the team was stuck on how to connect trips with stations you dug a level deeper and figured out we needed to create start_station and end_stations relationships. Another example of this is figuring out the calculations for the conditions dashboard.
  Overall, I enjoyed working with you throughout this project and I look forward to working with you on future projects!

  **From Victoria:** Danny! Fabulous work on the Bike Share project!! I loved your continuous curiosity for ways to improve, clean up, and accessorize our work. You have an infectious excitement for the technologies we’ve been learning and your dedication to digging deeper into ActiveRecord methods, creating fixtures, Tux experimentation, and drop-down capabilities helped the project immensely and helped all of us push our learning further. You also have a really high capacity to learn and although you have the abilities to get ahead of others sometimes, you are always willing and eager to explain things and catch everyone up (including other teams!) and that helps our entire cohort succeed. You were a fantastic Repo manager (that sounds gruesome for some reason hehe), and always encouraged us to work hard while maintaining a positive attitude. It was a blast making up silly songs & laughing with you all so much! I’m super proud of the work we put out and really grateful for all of the time and energy we all put in. I hope we get to work together again soon!

  **From Lauren:** Danny, it was such a pleasure working with you on this project! I really can’t think of any “constructive” feedback for you, or really anyone in our group. I think that speaks to each person being kind, ambitious, hard-working, and open to other ideas and methods of implementation. I’m super proud of the product that we delivered, and felt that we all learned a TON.
  I really appreciated your hard work into seeding the large csvs so elegantly, trying to make the dashboards faster with more advanced active record at the 11th hour, and working on trying to deploy to heroku! Despite your already advanced ruby knowledge, I’m grateful that you spent the time explaining anything you worked on, and additionally was always open to feedback, new ideas or implementation approaches.
  Overall, you are a funny, goofy, and chill person that made busting through such a difficult and length project really enjoyable!

##### Feedback to me for Little Shop

  **From Sam:** Hey Brah. I'm glad we finally got to work together! You're a lot of fun, and I'm glad we've had the chance to become friends at Turing. But anyhoo. You were a boon to the group: You contributed a strong technical skillset, a dedication to outcomes and a friendly disposition. It was nice of you to help Riley with our navbar, too. I noticed you have a tendency to research a challenge independently and discover a solution on your own before talking through an issue with the group. Self reliance is certainly a valuable skill, but there were times when I felt like we weren't really collaborating. I think you could be a more effective collaborator if you talk through your ideas and make sure your teammates are on the same page. Doing things that way is slower, no doubt, but I like to believe it leads to better outcomes. You should also probably learn VIM. I kid, I kid. But seriously, you've helped me learn a lot about my own collaboration style, and challenged me to be a better partner, which I honestly appreciate, and am hopefully making (slow) progress on. I hope we get more chances to work together in the future.

  **From Maria:** Danny! When the class was apprehensive in anticipation for the groups to be announced: I was super excited to see your name on the team, and am glad we finally got to work together! Not only were you technically strong with the concepts of the project, you made sure to keep the mood light & fun while we worked on Little Shop as a team. You are easy-going, have a great sense of humor, and you were cognizant of other team members. Not serious feedback: I question your choice in beverages with the Soylent consumption.....More serious feedback: while you are a rockstar at digging in and looking at code and you were not afraid to go down tangents and rabbit-holes, I think your inter-personal skills will certainly play an equal part to you being an amazing dev on a team. As for specifics, I appreciated your enthusiasm to go out on a limb with Materialize, especially with that slide-out-drawer that needed that one line of jquery--you were super thrilled once that got working! I admired your ability to tackle any issue in the project head-on, and when we did run into little speed-bumps, you immediately helped to diffuse any stress that surfaced! I really enjoyed working with you on crazy hybrid-animals, and hopefully we will cross paths again soon :)

  **From Jonathan:** I had a great time working with you. Your quickness in picking up new concepts, as well as your existing depth and breadth of knowledge, enabled us to blaze through every challenge in front of us. Also, your dogged determination to solve problems was great - though at the same time, it was sometimes hard to know what your process was for tackling said problem. In sharing that process with the group, it can lead to a better outcome and more learning all around, even with the trade-off of potentially arriving at a solution more slowly. All around, I really appreciated your sense of humor and good nature, and assert you were a true asset to the team. 10/10 would work with again.


## D: Professional Skills

#### **Gear Ups**

 [Empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)
It was interesting learning about privilege. I guess I have never really thought about the fact that I always assumed that I would go to college and that is a luxury that many people do not have. I think I am pretty empathetic and have usually been pretty good at looking at things from others point of view.

 [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
Im not sure how I feel about grit. By the way they define it, grit seems to boil down to a mixture of growth mindset and being passionate about something. This already sort of conflicts with what people usually think of when they think of the word grit. As far as teaching it in schools goes, I think you can definitely influence a growth mindset, but it is difficult to make people passionate about something that they aren't already.

 [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
I really enjoyed the Automation gear up. I am a big proponent of automation and feel that it we should treat it as an inevitable outcome, and what we should focus on is how to handle the social structure so that society is not impacted too heavily by automation. Im not sure what Turing can do to help, other than educate its students about the problem.

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Bike Share

**To Brett:** Hey Brett! This being the first time I had worked with you, I didn't really know what to expect. It turns out that your a really cool guy and a fantastic group mate. I had a great time working with you. Pairing with you was extremely smooth sailing. We really knocked those CRUD implementations out of the park. You really know your stuff and quickly absorb anything that you don't know. I love your positive attitude and flexibility too. Even when you were complaining about something you did so with a smile on your face. You also did a great job at keeping our group focused on the task at hand. Overall you are kind, hard-working, smart and a fun person to work with. I really don't have any constructive criticism. I hope we get to work together again in the future!

**To Victoria:** Hi Victoria! Working with you on Bike Share was a fantastic experience. You were a great Prime Minister and are a super fun person to work with. You ironed the hell out of that waffle board and did a great job keeping things organized. I love how willing a learner you are and how hard-working you are. You absorb things quickly, but aren't afraid to ask for clarification when there isn't something you understand. Thanks so much for all the work you put in, not only in this project but for our cohort as a whole.  I don't really have any constructive feedback, cause everything went so smoothly. Your wonderful interpersonal skills and great upbeat attitude made for a fantastic group experience. I cant believe how fortunate we were with the group we had, it was a ton of fun and I wouldn't change a thing. I really hope I get to work with you again in the future!

**To Lauren:** Hi Lauren! Working with you on Bike Share was a fantastic experience.  I admire your hard work and incredible cognitive resources endurance. For example, you would spend all day with us working on the project and then go home and add splendid styling to make our project look no longer like vomit. You are super smart and have a genuine thirst for problem solving. You blazed right through those dashboard methods in amazing fashion. I love how even if you know that something works, you need will often need to dive into it yourself to see exactly what is going on. Also, Your great sense of humor helped to keep things relaxed leading to a very stress free project. I think this is the part where I am supposed to give constructive feedback, but I cant think of any. I really hope I get to work with you again in the future!

#### **Posse**
I was one of the leaders for the Wozniak Posse this mod. We focused on learning data structures on algorithms.

I really enjoyed learning about different data structures and teaching them to others. I think it is pretty useful knowledge. Also, standing in front of the class was great practice for public speaking and teaching. It was a challenge to find time to work on things for the posse, but because of that I think we because really good at organizing our time.


#### **Playing a Part**

Other than leading a posse I have been pairing with Mod 1ers and others from my class to try to help them out. I also gave out cookies once.
