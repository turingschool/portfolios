# Brett Schwartz - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> This module I set out to gain a deep understanding of the Sinatra and Rails framework. I hadn't had any experience with any types of development frameworks so I was excited to jump in and learn how to build a web application from the ground up.

> I throughly enjoyed my time as a module 2 student. Diving into a brand new territory(web frameworks) was exciting and challenging. I enjoyed the process of how we learned new concepts this mod. For example, for our first week we were using sql queries to interact with our database. Then we were introduced to active record and it was like "This is awesome!!!" I felt that way about a lot of concepts we covered this mod. At times the tutorials dragged on for a bit but they were very useful to reference when trying to remember how to implement features.

>* Had a great experience with the pairing assessment with Andrew. Most concepts were pretty straightforward material we learned during the course of this mod. Thought it was very fair.



## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post:
> [Preparing for a bootcamp](https://gist.github.com/bschwartz10/83c9f9c5ce0d36813ffe76b1fe67070c)

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
> Blogger was a great opportunity to get my hands dirty with rials for the first time. I was able to get comfortable running migrations and setting up basic crud architecture. Blogger also introduced me to rails helpers which became increasingly valuable as the mod went on. The form helper was introduced in blogger. Creating forms in rails is different from Sinatra so it was valuable to see how they did it with form_for. Also strong params and flash messages were introduced in Blogger.

>Mix Master instructed us how to deploy an app to Heroku which was awesome. It also introduced us to using feature/model tests using capybara which was very valuable.

#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
> Job tracker was a great opportunity to use the knowledge we learned from class and apply it to a project. Job tracker tested how well I understood all the concepts from the tutorials. It was a good opportunity to stretch my muscles and work through some errors on my own.

>Gif Generator was an extremely valuable project for me this mod. All class concepts really set in while working through gif generator. I also learned 2 new concepts (Consuming API and Many to Many relationship) that has helped me dramatically throughout Little Shop. Gif generator was my favorite project of the mod!


## C: Group Work & Projects

> **Bike Share**
> In this project you'll use Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.
>* I had a great experience working on Bike Share. I was able to solidify my crud knowledge and work on my active record querying. It was also fun to build out a web app and having something visual to interact with.

> **Little Shop of Orders**
>* Build an e-commerce website using rails
>* Awesome experience, great exposure to sessions

> Bike Share evaluation comments:
You've gained a pretty deep understanding of the power of AR; share that knowledge! (spike, post-class session)
It's pretty expertly divided; the controller is dry (pushed most logic to models), should look into extracting POROS (classes/modules that don't correspond to tables/db; could extract a math module, and a parser to package params to pass into models
Can clean up validations to be all part of one validates function in models.
In future projects, be more aware of individual commits; commit often & split up driving responsibilities. (evaluation scores)

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share

  > From Lauren: Brett, it was such a pleasure working with you on this project! I really can’t think of any “constructive” feedback for you, or really anyone in our group. I think that speaks to each person being kind, ambitious, hard-working, and open to other ideas and methods of implementation. I’m super proud of the product that we delivered, and felt that we all learned a TON. I greatly appreciated your consistent and focused efforts on projects. I felt that you always stepped up to work on something you were uncomfortable doing (learning ActiveRecord, seeding, etc.) and always delivered something solid and tangible. I admire that you and others in our group wanted to make progress, but learn at the same time. You also knew everyone’s limits and encouraged us to take a break to get some food or coffee, which helped us step away and noodle on tough problems. Additionally, when you were stuck and asked for someone’s help, I thought you did a good job of providing background and context for the issue! Overall, you are a funny, light-hearted person that made busting through such a difficult and length project really enjoyable! - Lauren

  > From Victoria: Brett! I was super inspired by your hard work & dedication to our Bike Share Project! Your continuous curiosity in every aspect of this giant project helped our whole team to develop a solid understanding of all of the inner-workings & helped keep us all on the same pace. Your willingness & eagerness to be proactive with refactoring the seed file cleaned it up tremendously and really helped us set the stage for future seeding. You also continued to have a positive attitude no matter how silly we would get & you always kept a sense of humor even through the tough late nights. I was super proud and inspired by our entire team’s donation of time and effort & I’m really grateful for the dedication and hard work you contributed to the team! It was really enjoyable to pair with you; I hope we get to work together again!

  > From Danny: Hey Brett! This being the first time I had worked with you, I didn’t really know what to expect. It turns out that your a really cool guy and a fantastic group mate. I had a great time working with you. Pairing with you was extremely smooth sailing. We really knocked those CRUD implementations out of the park. You really know your stuff and quickly absorb anything that you don’t know. I love your positive attitude and flexibility too. Even when you were complaining about something you did so with a smile on your face. You also did a great job at keeping our group focused on the task at hand. Overall you are kind, hard-working, smart and a fun person to work with. I really don’t have any constructive criticism. I hope we get to work together again in the future!

  >* From Ken: Brett, it was a great opportunity to get to work with you. You know your stuff! It was great seeing you jump in and tackle problems and your dedication was inspiring. I hope I can get a chance to learn from you. You have a wealth of knowledge that will get you far in this industry.
  >* From Victoria Vasys: Brett, it’s been another delightful & successful project together! I am seriously impressed by your continual devotion of time and energy to group projects. Not only did we work together until 7 or 8p most nights, but then whenever you said you would go home and work on something else, you always completed it that night! I also thought your skills as a project manager were top notch -> you kept excellent notes, managed the Waffle Board really well, appropriately delegated tasks when need be, paired with us when we wanted, and were always keeping us on task so that we could be on pace with user stories. I learned tons from you this project and I think our skills balance really well. You were always pushing forward with necessary tasks and weren’t bothered when I side-tracked a little on styles n’ such. You’re a really strong developer and you’re going to make an excellent team member at real job someday super soon! Agh, I can’t believe we start our job hunts next mod!


## D: Professional Skills

#### **Professional Development Workshops**
> [Warm Outreach, Agile Process, Feedback](https://github.com/bschwartz10/career-development-curriculum/tree/master/module_two)

#### **Gear Ups**

> [Empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)
> I need to keep in mind that other people have life stresses that are going on in the background that i'm not familiar with. I need to do my best to understand the stresses and relate to it in the best manner possible. I might not be able to relate identically to the stress but i'm sure I can think of some parallel to relate to it.

> [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
> I was tempted to give up a few times at Turing. One specific instance that comes to mind is when I tried to implement factory girl into my blogger tutorial and it blew up my whole project. Git came into play b/c I really wanted to get to iteration 7 to learn authentication. I've definitely strengthened my grit during my time at Turing.

> [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
>The disparity of wealth will increase. The amount of jobs that will be eliminated is alarming. People like robots when they are specialized but get scared when they are able to accomplish multiple tasks. The auto car will be the the 1st major robot revolution to effect many people/jobs. People that don't want to adapt to technology are going to be weaseled out of the economy. People in general like robots until it affects their wallet/job.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Bike Share

  >* For Danny Radden: Danny, it was a pleasure working with you on this project. Back in Mod1, we didn’t get to many opportunities to work together so i’m glad we were able to work together on a project to kick off Mod2. I really enjoyed pairing with you while building out the CRUD functionality of our trips entity. I thought we found a great rhythm switching duties between feature/model testing and building out the controller/views. Throughout the project, I thought you did a great job of getting our team over the ‘hump’ when we were faced with a challenge we weren’t familiar with. For example, when the team was stuck on how to connect trips with stations you dug a level deeper and figured out we needed to create start_station and end_stations relationships. Another example of this is figuring out the calculations for the conditions dashboard. Overall, I enjoyed working with you throughout this project and I look forward to working with you on future projects!

  >* For Lauren Oliveri: it was a pleasure working with you on this project. Back in Mod1, we didn’t get to many opportunities to work together so i’m glad we were able to work together on a project to kick off Mod2. I thought you did a great job of owning certain aspects of the project. For example, you did a great job of completing the station dashboard while the other members of the group were working on different iterations. You also used you knowledge from your ‘flex box’ lightning talk to give our web app so awesome styling! Even though you were ‘driving’ when we were styling our webpage, you were still open to ideas from other group members which I thought was awesome. Although you weren’t our official ‘project manager’, I still thought you did a great job of consistently going back to our waffle board to keep us organized. Overall, I enjoyed working with you throughout this project and also getting to know you better outside of school. Looking forward to working with you on future projects!

  >* For Victoria Vasys: Victoria, it was a pleasure working with you on this project. Back in Mod1, we didn’t get to many opportunities to work together so i’m glad we were able to work together on a project to kick off Mod2. I thought you did a fantastic job as our project manager throughout the project. As a team we were constantly checking our waffle board to stay on track and organized. The little things you did throughout the project like taking notes during our checkins with Beth were such a big help throughout the week! When we paired for the trip dashboard, I thought we did a good job of taking a step back to make sure we understood the relationships while we were stuck. Once we had a good mental model of our relationships the calculations became a lot clearer and we moved through them pretty quickly. Overall, I enjoyed working with you throughout this project and I look forward to working with you on future projects!

##### Feedback from me for Little Shop

  >* For Ken Lee: It was a pleasure working with you on this project. Throughout the project I saw a lot of improvement from you. The last couple of days your were able to write your own tests and build out the features with small guidance. You also did a great job of asking about features you didn’t understand.  I felt at times you were overwhelmed by the scope of the application. I would focus on implementing deliberate practice into your practice routine. Pick a small part of the application you are confused about and practice building it out 3-4 times. Then after you feel comfortable with that portion of the application, move on to the next.  Overall, I enjoyed working with you throughout this project and also getting to know you better outside of school. Looking forward to working with you on future projects!

  >* For Victoria: Another successful project done! Victoria, it was a pleasure to work with you once again! I really enjoy working with you because I like to learn from you strong problem solving skills. Consistency throughout the project when I get stuck trying to crunch out calculations you come to the rescue. You then go the extra mile to explain to me your logic and it has been invaluable for my learning during this mod. I also think you are very open to hearing others opinions for certain features and are open to trying ideas other than your own. You’ve also done a great job spearheading our styling efforts for this project. I’ve enjoyed touching up features/tests while you flesh out the layout of our webpages. Overall, it’s been a pleasure working with you throughout this mod!
