# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?
>* Learn Javascript!
>* Do my final project using React and a Rails backend
>* Final project will be 1 page application using css grids

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
>The biggest technical challenge for me was pushing both applications to production. The first time I pushed the applications to production I didn't precompile so none of my javascript worked. I had to delete both apps off of Heroku, rollback commits and restart the whole process.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
>I didn't really like anything about the challenge but now I have a solid process for pushing apps up to Heroku which I am happy about. I documented my steps so for next time I shouldn't run into the same issues.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
>I solved the challenge by first recognizing which part of my app wasn't working. When I checked the sources tab in the chrome debugger I realized my JS files were never pushed up to production. I then had to find the last commit on github that was stable and revert back to it. I made sure to precompile the second time and it worked when I pushed up to production.

* What did you learn?
>Always precompile! I also learned about reverted commits in GitHub which I never had to do before so that was a valuable experience.

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
>Getting comfortable using node.js in the backend was a challenge to get the project off the ground. It was definetely more manual than setting up a backend Rails API. Creating the relationship between meals and foods was also very difficult without the assistance of Rails Helpers.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
>First I reviewed our lessons from class to understand the concepts/functions of Node, Express and Knex. Then I planned out what I wanted to do and would go to the docs to figure out what the syntax was. The functionality ended up being similar it was just more of a manual process than a Rails app.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
>I liked discovering new ways to complete the same task in another language. It helps me draw connections to what i'm doing and furthers my knowledge. For example, yesterday I was working on rails and when I ran rake:db create I noticed I created a dev and test database on my computer. I never noticed I was creating two databases until I had to manually do it on this project.
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
>Building a backend RESTful API with Node, Express and Knex. Using vanilla JS and JQuery to manipulate the DOM. Use Ajax calls to communicate with the database without reloading the page.
* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
>Trying to understand the overall technical concepts before diving into the code.
* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
>It was a difficult experience. I thought my pair and I worked best when we were working on our own but it was difficult to do that with this project. I had a little background knowledge in manipulating the DOM with JS so I tried to share that knowledge with my partner as often as I could.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
>The biggest technical challenge for my Capstone Project was getting started with React. I did a bunch of tutorials to get some experience and conceptual understanding of React. When I dove into my project though it was hard to get off the ground. I was running into a lot of syntax errors and that was frustrating.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
>After having a really tough day trying to get the foundation of my app going I decided to sleep it off and start fresh in the morning. I made steady progress the next day and felt a lot better about my knowledge of React. I definitely still ran into errors but I was learning my previous ones and got better each day.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
>I enjoyed learning React for the most part. I knew it was going to be challenging learning a completely new framework and relished the experience. I made sure to take note of how much I've learned since the previous day and that kept me positive throughout
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
>Stateless Components inherit state from Stateful Components. Child Components update their parents state. Responsive Design through CSS grids

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
>Casey gave me very valuable feedback after my mock interview. She told me to speak more generally about testing principles in software instead of just narrowing it down into TDD. I need to expand my knowledge on OOD principles. I need to write a test for my code challenge first before I start writing the source code. Overall I think I need to gain a better conceptual knowledge of OOP. This is why I plan on reading POOTR as soon as I graduate

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?
>I really enjoyed the experience of facilitating a gear up. I was able to lead a session on the Attention Economy which is a topic of great interest to me. I was also part of a great team of other Mod4 students that made the experience very fruitful. I thought the actual gear up was an overall success and received feedback from multiple participants that they enjoyed the session.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
>Was a leader in my posse. I think this is a required part of the Turing experience b/c it ties all the students together. It gives resources for the earlier mod students to reach out to if they have questions about class material.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
>Rails development knowledge, React development knowledge, ability to work in teams from 2-6 in size.
