## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

This mod I am hoping to refine my programming skills.  I want to write better, cleaner code more quickly.  I think my approach has been “get it to work” for the past three mods. I would like to move on to “get it to work by writing clean, efficient code that others can understand”.  I am also looking forward to a taste of a JavaScript and learning a little bit of a second language.

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (PASS) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  Definitely JavaScript.  Writing and using JavaScript is a slow process for me… making sure I am targeting the correct element in the correct way often takes multiple attempts before I get what I am looking for.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  Although time consuming and often confusing, when I did eventually get the JavaScript to do what I was trying to do it felt good. It also feels good knowing I have another (very widely used) tool (JavaScript) in in my tool-belt when I set out to work on future projects.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  Definitely slow and steady persistence. Google, look for examples, try some things, use debugger, try some more things, google, look for more examples, try again, use debugger...repeat...repeat...repeat

* What did you learn?
  Don’t be afraid of all of your developer tools; use them! Use debugger to understanding what is going on and what you’re missing.  Often I “thought” I was grabbing something, but when I inspected it or console.logged it there was nothing there. I never would have made progress without dev tools and debugger!

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
In general JavaScript, but more specifically dynamically changing the four meal tables’ data- updating calorie count information whenever a food was added or deleted from a meal.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Actually, pretty much the same approach as the final exam “challenges”... just keep plugging away, trying things, googling, asking questions, looking for examples, trying things…

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
The big difference between this and the final was the ability to pair with a classmate.  I found this to be really helpful in learning, bouncing around ideas, and dividing up work.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
Got a lot more familiar with JavaScript. I anticipate I will come back to this project the next time I need to implement a front or backend with JavaScript. Also, learned and implemented, what appears to be pretty common/reoccurring, filtering/sorting methods in JavaScript.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
I wish I were quicker in general at solving problems… I felt like it was just slow going, lots of trying things before getting anything working… maybe I need a more systematic approach than just “trying things and googling” (see above).

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
I liked working with someone else while learning something new.  I think it allowed me to get further than I would have on my own.  I know I wouldn’t have been able to accomplish all that we did on my own.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Two big challenges, 1. creating the progress bar that would increment dynamically and would increment based on the percentage of the total goal (which is determined by the user when s/he sets the goal).  So, the goal could increment by one fourth or one fifth or one third, or whatever depending what the total count is. 2. Sending out three kinds of texts, one that confirms a user is signed up to get reminder texts, and two reminders- one at the beginning of the week and one at the end of the week.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Looking for examples/tutorials, trying to implement/recreate, pairing with others (classmate and Turing fellow)

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
Exposure to new things that were very “real world”. Both of these user stories were ones I had created and that I wanted to be part of my app. I was excited and motivated to get these features to work.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
Using Twilio’s API to send text messages, creating a rake task to call the methods to send the texts,  and setting up Heroku Scheduler to run the rake task (that will send reminder text) twice a week.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

My technical interview question/answers need to be more precise and shorter.  I completed two mock technical interviews this mod.  One went pretty well, but the other was not so good.  During the second of the two, although I was able to respond, a number of my answers lacked depth and technical expertise. I did not feel strong on any of my answers.  The second portion of the interview was a coding challenging; again I did not feel strong.  At first, I attempted to plan/pseudo-code.  However, I did not make much progress.  Eventually, the interviewer jumped into “coach mode” and we were able to solve the problem together.
I received quite a bit of good feedback on both of the mock interviews.  I plan to practice and refine my responses for technical questions.  I know with practice I can respond intelligently, articulately, and with detail for these kinds of questions- but it will take practice! I also fully intend to do regular coding practice to better prepare for the coding challenge portion of future interviews.


## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

This was a fun project!  I liked the opportunity to collaborate with students in the frontend program (even though it wasn’t on a coding project).  It was difficult to give up time to work on something  other than projects/assignments, but totally worth it and rewarding when it came all together.  I thought our group had fun, touched on important concepts, and got the class to engage in meaningful discussion.  I enjoyed this opportunity, and thought the planning periods were well timed/spaced.  I would encourage this project for future mod 4 students.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

Although I was pretty consumed by the projects and assignments this inning, I did try to take time to give back to the community in some small ways.  I have made an effort to connect with the Backend Mod 1 and 2 students in my posse to support them technically and just emotionally.  Our group has been pretty informal, but really supportive- whether it is with code/technically questions, or “I’m falling apart” moments.  In addition, I have been a regular participant in Joan Clarke Society. This Mod (since the Tuesday morning meetings have been put on hold) I attended the happy hour meetup held during this mod.  It was really great to connect with other women devs and Turing alums.  I hope to continue to be a part of this group post-Turing.  I also helped to connect my open source project, the local dev group/meetup working on it, and the Turing community.  The final meetup/coding night this July was held here at Turing. Finally, throughout the mod I have made an effort to leave rooms cleaner than I found them- tidying up the vault, cleaning up our classroom, washing dishes, making coffee, etc.  These are small things, but, I believe, very valuable to community morale and stability.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

1. I’ve always had a pretty solid work ethic, but while at Turing I took this to another level I didn’t even know existed.  I hope to hold on to this as I look for a job, practicing my coding skills, and move into a developer role.
2. Continue to embrace the uncomfortable feeling of “I don’t know what I’m doing…” While at Turing I have felt like this often. However, every time I find away, figure it out, and solve the problem.  In order to grow and learn something new you have to wade through the unknown. I definitely don’t want to lose this motivation and perseverance post-Turing.
3. I’ve really enjoyed working with other developers while at Turing, as a mentee, mentor, pairing and on group projects.  I learn a lot working with others and just by watching others solve problems. I think my process gets better by getting to be a part of/seeing their process.  I very much want to continue to work collaboratively on the job and on side projects post Turing.
