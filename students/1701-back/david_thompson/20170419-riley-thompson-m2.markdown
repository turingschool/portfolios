>* Gave myself a 2 on the final assessment because I felt I performed badly and let stress get to me.

>* Gave myself a 4 on Feedback & Community Participation, because I feel the Wozniak Posse I helped lead has brought a good amount of value to the community.


-----------------------

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

| Category | Score (optional) |
| ----- | --- |
| **Pairing Assessment** | X |
| **Written Diagnostic** | X |

>* As noted above, I felt I did poorly on the pairing assessment.



## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post:
> [Binary Search Tree](https://gist.github.com/ryt11/9adc9279fea35d5a0274f30b89c70484)

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
> * Although these intermediate projects felt a little dull after a while, I know that the repetition served in cementing some of the core fundamentals of using rails effectively.

#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
> * I enjoyed the creative license given to us when assigned the mini-project. When you own something as an idea, it is much easier to put the work into it.


## C: Group Work & Projects

> **Bike Share**

>* Bike Share was a ton of work and in Andrew's words: a trial by fire in regards to the active record queries required. I feel like that immersive approach is most affective for me as a student, because I love being challenged and asked to use my resources to come to a solution.

> **Little Shop of Orders**

>* Little shop has been a lot of fun, and a great exercise in authentication/authorization/design patterns for an e-commerce website. Again, I enjoyed the creative license that was given during this project as well for the same reason listed above. It was great to see everyone have a little fun with their own ideas.

> Bike Share evaluation comments:

 Limited use of ActiveRecord methods (for example: frequent use of .all followed by data manipulation using Ruby where other ActiveRecord methods would be more appropriate). Projects at this level may also include queries that do not produce correct results, but the query would likely need to be completely rewritten.

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share

  >* From Sergey Lukyanenko:

  It’s been very beneficial and a pleasure to work with Riley. He has good communication skills. Riley is able to understand problems clearly, break them down into hypotheses and propose solutions in a coherent manner. Riley is able to identify and use resources very effectively. He is always willing to help others. He is a great teammate in every sense.

  >* From Ken Lee:

  Riley, I think you are a really talented team member. I know we would not of gotten to where were on the project if it wasn't for you. You knowledge and calmness helped keep me level headed. I especially found your willingness to listen to feedback and take action inspiring. We team talked about how we could do better with you teaching us and you did. You slowed down for us and walked us through some really complex stuff. I also learned to that I should speak up more and earlier on because you taught me the benefits of using one of my strengths - communication. I look forward to getting the opportunity to work with you again. Thank you!!!

##### Feedback to me for Little Shop

  >* From Nicholas Jacques:

  Riley you were an awesome partner to work with on this project. We ran into some unique challenges on this project that I think you did an excellent job of handling. You clearly have a very strong grasp of the rails concepts that we have learned so far. While you are very proficient in using rails, I was most impressed by your willingness to commit to writing strong tests and learning FactoryGirl on the fly to help facilitate that. Despite the challenges that we faced in our project you always kept a positive attitude and never let it affect your work ethic. Overall, working with you was a really positive experience and I hope I have chance to work with you gain.

  >* From Mark Van Akkeren:

  For Riley:  To say i was intimidated to work with you guys would be an understatement. I knew I was in over my head from the get go.  I appreciate you allowing me to drive for a lot of the first week. It helped reinforce a lot of my understandings at that point.  I’m not sure _where_ we could have put it in this project (what with the successive, seemingly sequential, user stories) but a group work technique that I’ve found to help when teams are made up of varying levels of talent is to give some ownership of a small feature to the weaker member and let them run with it.  Funny to be on the other side of that advice now!  Finally, making the point to ask me about coming back to the learning points that I’d put out there for myself in the DTR, was generous as well as your patience in going over it.

## D: Professional Skills

#### **Professional Development Workshops**
> [Warm Outreach, Agile Process, Feedback](https://gist.github.com/ryt11/0b94d49fbe01f25c2e6bee01dea73318)

#### **Gear Ups**

> [Empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

  I found the session on empathy to be especially rewarding. I was a great reminder of the privilege I'm afforded and take for granted daily, but it was also great to share some of the struggles that I have gone through in my life with my peers. I was a little disappointed that such a potentially eye-opening exercise was only afforded a short amount of time, but I understand the scheduling issues.

> [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

My takeaway from this session was that it is important to understand that grit is more-so about long term persistence, rather than the ability to work yourself to death in 72 hour stints. The exercise on finding value in our work was also very useful, as I was reminded  why I started this journey in the first place which helped to solidify my commitment and work ethic.

> [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

I absolutely loved the discussion that this topic raised. It was great to hear other's points of view, and have my own heard in a non-judgmental atmosphere. It was an exciting exercise to think about the future, and make our own predictions on what is to come. I'm glad Turing is making an attempt to make their students more aware about such an impending issue.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Bike Share

  >* For Sergey Lukyanenko:

  Collaborating with Sergey was a wonderful experience. I enjoyed his willingness to collaborate and share his ideas so readily, which helped to keep a steady work flow through out the project.  I was impressed constantly by Sergey’s work ethic and focus. His determination was inspiring and helped me push through some tough spots in our project. I would be willing to work with  him in another setting in an instant.

  >* For Ken Lee:

  Working with Ken on Bike Share was a rewarding experience. I enjoyed Ken’s optimistic attitude  which helped to keep the atmosphere fun, no matter the issues we were having related to the project.  Although Ken has other important responsibilities outside of school which keep him on a tight schedule, he did his absolute best to communicate that and remain available. Ken has a great desire to learn/improve and is always asking questions to understand things more clearly. I enjoyed that spirit, and would very much enjoy working with him again in any context.

##### Feedback from me for Little Shop

  >* For Nicholas Jacques:

   Collaborating with Nick has been a great experience throughout the course of the Little Shop project. I really appreciated his willingess to help me become more familiar with FactoryGirl, which served to be an invaluable resource in our project that streamlined our testing work flow. Along with being knowledgeable, Nick also has a great work ethic that comes with a positive attitude. He was willing to come in both days on the weekend to ensure that we were at a good place in our user stories. Overall, I would recommend Nick as a teammate to anyone because I know he would be a valued contributor in any setting.


  >* For MVA:

  Mark brings a positive attitude and a sense of humor which lightens the mood even in the most stressful setting. I enjoyed the passion you brought regarding  our project subject (scumbags), hearing you rant was hilarious. I also appreciate the fact that Mark knows what he's strong/weak at and attempts to reach out for help to improve on the things he may not be as experienced in. I regret as a partner, that I did not take more time to work through things with him. Overall, Mark was a great partner to have.  


#### **Posse**
  >* Sam, Danny, and I led Wozniak Posse which taught a different CS data structure every week.

  >* My favorite thing about the posse was probably coding/whiteboarding the different data structures.

  >* The opportunity to teach my peers, and practice my public speaking has been invaluable. I have seen a lot of growth in that area since we started the posse.

#### **Playing a Part**

> Leading a posse/spikes, walking around the vault and helping Mod 1 students.
