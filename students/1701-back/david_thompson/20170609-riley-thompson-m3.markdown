# Riley Thompson - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Feel comfortable designing a rails app from the ground up, as well as being exposed
to the process of building/consuming APIs, and the design patterns involved.

## Self-Assessment

| Section | Category | Score (optional) |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 3|
| B | **Individual Work & Projects** | 3 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 2 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 3 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 2 |

This was a hard module due to some personal issues I was having.

-----------------------

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

| Category | Score (optional) |
| ----- | --- |
| **Ruby Style** | 3 |
| **Rails Syntax & API** | 3 |
| **Testing** | 2 |
| **Progression/Completion** | 3 |
| **Workflow** | 2 |

## B: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/ryt11/reddit_clone)**
>* Cloning Reddit functionality using their own API.
>* Was a fun exposure to consuming APIs, the Reddit API was a bit more clunky than the more popular options, but I felt it
gave me experience in parsing API documentation that isn't as well presented.


## C: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/glassjoseph/rails_engine)**
>* Creating API from Etsy data involving various BI queries.
>* Had a blast using AR to build the more complicated BI queries.

> **[Cloney Island](https://github.com/NicholasJacques/corkboard)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/NicholasJacques/corkboard)**
>* Cloning functionality of thumbtack.com
>* Had a great time working with the single table inheritance table we had, and making our
sessions controller work with both oauth/manual logins as well as handling pro/regular users.

## D: Professional Skills

#### **Professional Development Workshops**
> [Resume, Turing Portfolio, Flower, Trello, Mod-4-Plan](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-b/<your_name>.md)

#### **Gear Ups**

> [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
Microagressions can come in many forms, and it is important to be aware in order to create a comfortable environment for everyone.
I continue to think about how microaggressions don't always have to come with mal-intent, the example which references "hiring an asian developer because you think he will be knowledgeable" isn't necessarily a negative slight again the Asian race, but it makes assumptions about an individual based on their race which is unacceptable. I'm challenging myself in every day conversation to think about the presumptions I make about people that aren't necessarily true.


> [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
My biggest takeaway from this gear up came from the interactive data visualization. It was pretty clear that a small amount of bias can cause a huge concern when it comes to diversity. Conversely, a small attempt to surround yourself with a fairly diverse environment can create a huge impact. I realized that "just not being an asshole" isn't enough, and that I need to start making conscious attempts to make an impact regarding diversity.

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Rales Engine

  >* For Joseph Glass:
  Collaborating with Joseph has been a great experience throughout the course of the Rales Engine project. I really appreciated his patience in dealing with a late start. Along with being knowledgeable and collaborative, Joseph also has a great work ethic that comes with a positive attitude. He was willing to work as long as necessary the night before the project was due to ensure we had a satisfactory score. Overall, I would recommend Joseph as a teammate to anyone because I know he would be a valued contributor in any setting.

#### **Posse**
  >* Mainly focused on data structures/interview prep.
  >* Meeting other people in different mods at Turing.
  >* The posse was specifically focused on interview prep, which will be useful in the job search.

#### **Playing a Part**

The Turing community was way more of a support structure for me this mod, than I was for it.
