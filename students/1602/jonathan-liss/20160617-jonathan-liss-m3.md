Serving an API for the Sales Engine Data.

**Evaluator: Brenna**

**Notes:**

* 62 Tests %96.88 Coverage
* Refactored significantly to reduce repetition but originally built the project with standard controller methods. Can speak to and explain the design decisions and really pushed to experiment with better/faster/dryer ways to organize data.
* Created "SuperController" to handle repetition.

**Feedback For You:**

From Kris Foss:
* I didn't know what to expect going into a group with Jon Liss, I was intimidated, because programming seems to come so naturally to him and I'd never been in a group with him before.  I didn't know how someone who wrote code in so many languages and solved complex algorithms for fun would view me and my own programming style.  But Jon was great to work with.  He's patient and kind and tireless.  He pushes himself to tackle really advanced parts of the project and follows through to completion, despite hitting serious technical resistance and difficulty.  He was able to clean up a few of my messes with git, help me dig through some vicious bugs, help integrate all the moving parts, and he and Hedy really cleaned things up with the refactoring.  Although his skill set is very advanced, he does not talk down to or over other group members and he's an inclusive, encouraging, fun person to work with.  I know he will be extremely successful in the work force.

From Hedy:
* please refer back to mod 2 rush-hour feedback. cuz nothing's changed! but if i must say something, it starts with name-calling ""\*\*\*\*!#%"", of course - b/c otherwise, this would not be thePaulista. and since I am told to be kind, here it is:

* so you've improved at least in two areas: tdd, and cleaner code through refactoring since mod 2.  we all know that code just comes out of your butt, but the earlier worries about whether you could clean it up was looming in my head, i won't lie. so i was glad you brought up spending the last night just going line by line and refactoring the whole app, as well as trying to adhere to rails convention from beginning to end, and referencing when you weren't sure.  part of the reason we scored well was all in that.   i hate adding more air to your frigging huge head, but you really are an excellent team member (but one notch less than me).  you will come as early as needed, and stay just as late to get a good product in.  you really rallied late the past two days and nights to get the product and code looking as it did.  final finish time: 4am !!! and when you were unhappy with the project on our last client checkin, you did verbalize it appropriately, and sketched out a solid plan on how to get 'er done.  i didn't see this proactiveness as much during Rush Hour, mainly b/c it was a smaller project and we did well pacing and hitting our target each day.   so i was happy to see that you weren't despondent, but used any frustration to motivate yourself to work harder. great job!  though ordinarily i don't enjoy pairing with others, i find it is always fun co-coding with you - always (albeit, there was one time i wanted to close the laptop while you were typing).  also, thanks for trusting me to customize your laptop, switching entirely to vim (b/c it is the BEST!!!), replacing dumb bash with zsh,  and for trusting me when i say that hot peppers in a potbelly sandwich changes everything!  now for the judgement!  but...this is getting so long, i'll slack you the actionably unkind things to you, cuz it's longer than the above.  so, i still think you are the one standout in our module when it comes to coding and problem solving, but i promise to kick your butt in five years! just wait!!!"

From Jared Roth:
* Jon is experienced with programming and it shows. He is generally well-aware of what is going wrong in a given moment and usually knows how to fix it. With this experience, though, comes the danger of over-complicating some solutions because of "legacy" knowledge. I think the simplest way of improving would be to focus on how things *should* be done  (as in: best practices for whatever type of project it is) rather than how they *could* be done.

### Giving Feedback

To Hedy:
* Hedy, you're way stronger than you insist you are.  Your work ethic is like the work ethic of someone who has a really good work ethic.  Like crazy good.  Thanks for staying up with me for practically the entire night going over everything and making sure the project was up to our standards.  That was really great of you.  I think in terms of criticism, I would say that you do get fixated on things and obsess over them.  The morning our project was due, I could tell you were really stressing out, and you wanted the project to be perfect in your eyes.  If I could give you feedback for that it would be this: Trust in your teammates when you're up against the wire.  Don't try to take on making the project perfect by yourself.  We're all in this together.  If something goes wrong it's a reflection on all of us, not just you, so you don't have to take on more than your share of work.  That being said, your work ethic and your programming ability are definitely what powered us through the pivot.  Really could not have done it without you.  Plus you figured out AJAX which is dope!  Thanks for making my last rando-group project a great one.

To Jared:
* Jared, like I said at our other DTR sesh, I was nervous about taking on a 4th member, and I didn't know you yet so it seemed like it could be double trouble.  That was definitely not the case! You quickly jumped into a project you didn't have a say in, with a group that wasn't your scheduled group, and yet you rose to the occasion by coming up with the framework of how our needs system works under the hood.  You proved to be a really strong programmer, and you definitely were a huge asset to the team. However, my criticism would be that a) you took too much time away from the project, (i do understand that plans are plans and things happen though), and b) you tend to check out just a bit early when faced with what seems like a wall of problems.  You're a very strong programmer, bust through the wall. Don't let it get you frustrated or stop your progress.  No matter how big that wall seems, there's always a path over or around it, you just need to stick with it just a little longer to find that path.  If you take one thing away from the pivot or my feedback, I think it should be to ground yourself, know when to take a step back and reconsider a problem, and to be confident in your abilities, I know I am.  Also get some sort of side project and do something awesome!  It was a pleasure working with and getting to know you.

To Kris:
* Sup roomie!  I was stoked to see that we were paired, because you're probably the nicest and most generous person in the cohort.  I thought all my other group projects lacked that someone who was not constantly butting heads with people and was someone who you could just enjoy working with.  You played a crucial part in setting a really good (theme | environment | feeling) for the group which enabled us to have a (99% of the time) really good working relationship, and I can't even begin to tell you how important that is for the success of the group.  My feedback is the same as before: You're unnecessarily hard on yourself for your hardships, a huge thing that helped me grow as a person and as a programmer was that I started to really believe what everyone told me.  So give yourself more credit for what you do.  You took on the biggest chunk of work in the entire project, and you came through for everyone with it.  What you accomplished was nothing short of fantastic, and you did it all without relying on any of us for help, which was something no one else in the group did.  I had Jared and Hedy to ask for help with the stuff I was doing, but you did the entirety of the styling without anyone else working on something similar.  Plus all the admin stuff.  Thats downright crazy.  Keep doing what you're doing and you'll be just fine!

From Hedy:
* Awesome! Amazing! Unbelievable! Charismatic! Tenacious! Sangfroid! Ponderous! Stalwart! Blithe! These are the few words I need to know for my GRE verbal section for august.  But if you want to know about linked-liss, he's alright!  Not bad at all, actually!  In fact, he's pretty cool! In essence, he embodies the studdette I tried to be, but couldn't but will be. Cuz I got a promise to keep â€“ to kick his arse in 5 years.  And I keep my promises.  The guy is prodigiously good at coding, so much so that it's sickening and almost vomit inducing.  Another weird thing is that pairing with him in Rush Hour in mod 2 was probably the highlight of the mod for me.  That's a weird admission.  Whereas, I often find myself awkward and uncomfortable during pairings, I did find pairing with Jon to be quite enjoyable. Mostly b/c he's a fun guy all around, and also b/c I'm so awesome myself. Dare I say, I probably got better b/c I paired with him on two projects?  It irks me a wee bit that I have to admit that in front of him, but that's the truth.  Apart from that, he also became a good friend over the course of my time at Turing.  I'm a tortured soul, and doubted my skills all through my days at Turing.  And I think part of the reason I stayed as long as I did was due to his earnest encouragements. He's full of crap too, but I'd like to think that he also has this part in him that really desires to see others succeed for their good. 

From Ling: 
* Little Brother is a poet, and he doesn't even know it. Well, maybe he does because he occasionally quotes Shakespeare that one time and attempted to write it in binary code. This just goes to show how much of his vitality draws from solving problems through programming. He also enjoys teaching and seeks opportunities to improve himself as a teacher. As his older sister, I'm obligated to say it requires a lot of training to be a good teacher - like Yoda (or perhaps that's not the best example of a great teacher unless one's educator status is measured by an aptitude for exercising Socratic methodologies? Does that even apply in this situation? - so there is a ways to go. On the bright side, time is on his side! The programming force seems to be with him and I'm excited to see the amazing things he'll crank out next module. ClarkeBase was a cool project and it would have been a Fantastic Four convening. But alas, Chinese words spoke to me, if words can speak. All in all, Little Brother continued to crush stuff this module. Boy this paragraph object seems to break SRP and may be not a bit DRY. Refactor later? For now, #awesomepossum.

### Playing a Part

* I led a micro-posse for Mod 1
* I did a student led session on Python
