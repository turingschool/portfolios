### Work

I did some more things this module, this time with Java, JavaScript and React.

Here they are:

#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jdliss/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

We made a game in Java that was modeled after Geometry wars' concept.

* top down shooter
* enemies follow player around screen
* kill enemies to get points

##### Eval Comments

* Went above and beyond with working with mentors, code refactoring, best practices and understanding the language above just copying and pasting code that 'works' or bringing in 3rd party libraries in an unfamiliar language.

### Projects

#### ScaleUp - LookingFor Front-end

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lookingforme/lookingforfrontend)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/boxtrot_prime_project.markdown)

Looking For is a job fetching application that searches the world wide web for job postings that might be relevant to a Turing Student's interest, stores them and generates a searchable portal to answer the question: 'Hello Company, is it me you're looking for?'

#### Project Feedback

#### Blog(s)

> "No." I said. And that was that.

this is wonderful.

I really enjoyed this post. Funny, well written, and pertinant.

I would recommend adding a link to the repo, maybe a screenshot of the game, and calling out and linking to your mentor by name and his comments - since I think those are very impressive.

#### General

Thanks for your feedback throughout the project and the burn out honesty. I assume you already know this, but be careful in real projects/jobs when you get burned out to keep it a little bit more under wraps in group scenarios. I think you have a very thoughtful way of assessing situations and are a super hardworker - but, while hilarious, the 'what she said' response to stand up doesn't convey how much is going on in the background. We all know one another, are in the same boat and know this about you - so it's a'ok at Turing... but in a job, not everyone will have that background context.

Again, I think you already know this, but I am contractually obligated as an instructor to point it out. :D

Thank you for the hard work on this project and over this project and fighting that burn out!

#### Partner Feedback to Me

* Sal - JD! It was good to finally work with you, and I'm sorry it had to be on a project where you couldn't break out the Java/C++ skills that I know you're burning to use. I feel as though the most impressive thing to see from you was how you can step into a language/framework that's largely unfamiliar to you and still make solid contributions. I think that not having Game Time as JS background would have made Looking For a pretty tough project for me, and you were still able to make those connections. I guess the one thing I couldn't tell was if you wanted to really dig in with React, or if you were happy to have it as something that you knew a little bit about. If not, or if you were just exhausted, then that totally makes sense, but if you did, then I would say be sure to speak up and dig in. I think we took on a lot of parts of the project that were mostly cleanup, but if you were more interested in tackling a new feature/building a new component from scratch then we certainly could have done that. Just be sure to speak up and let people know what you want. Either way, I'm absolutely sure that things are going to go well. You have so much good stuff ahead of you that I'm jealous. Enjoy it.

### Giving Feedback

* To Bernesser - I was genuinely surprised when you asked me if I wanted to do Game Time in Java.  It was a huge risk, and you had no experience with anything lower level than Ruby.  It was also pretty cool to see that you were confident enough in my skills to ask me to go on this Java adventure with you, knowing I had no Java experience too.  The whole experience was great and I'm really happy with how the game turned out.  It was actually a big throwback to mod 1. Working together in a language neither of us knew, you with no experience, me with something kinda similar.  Then throughout the whole project you picked up the language and the concepts incredibly quick and made the same contributions that I did, even though I had more experience with that style of coding.  In my mind you actually carried the project initially, figuring out the canvas and the frame stuff faster than me, springboarding us into a successful project.  Your research and interaction with Jake was also on point.  As always it was a pleasure working with you, and I hope we can do it more in the future. 

* To Sunny - our glorious overlord sunny is magnanimous and generous and I want for nothing under his reign

* To Alex - Although I haven't had any projects with you, the times I have paired with you in class or otherwise have made me regret that.  You bring a real perspective to your work, and incorporate your experiences growing up into everything you do.  You may not feel this way, but I'm really happy you jumped down into our cohort for mod 3 and 4 haha.  #BeLikeKris and you'll go places bro!  I'll catch you and Sunny in the future and we'll play some basketball eventually.

* To Jeneve - Jeneve you're an absolute killer.  You crushed Scale Up... and more!  I wish I had your methodical approach to learning and consuming and doing that you employed in those two weeks.  Every day you came in with something like "yeah I spent a bunch of extra time doing this and that and researching something else".  You dove into SVG and animation completely on your own!  Scale Up would have been a trainwreck without you on the team.  If Sal wasn't project manager you would have killed it being the team lead.  They way you went about dismantling that huge SearchBarAndListings component was super impressive, and I certainly learned a thing or two from watching you work.  I absolutely want to see what kinds of awesome stuff you accomplish in the real world.  Best of luck moving forward, keep crushing it.

* To Sal - Sup Sal!  Finally got to work with you and real talk - you're a perfect professional.  Always on point with our tasks, writing things down, keep track of what's left to do and what we already did.  You slayed the project manager role, and I know our project definitely wouldn't have been as successful if you weren't there. Apologies to you that you had to experience burn-out Jon instead of try-hard Jon.  I guess this just means that we'll have to do some awesome stuff in the future together.  Thanks for making the Scale Up project such an enjoyable one despite my efforts to the contrary.  You definitely don't need this, but best of luck in your new position training the Turing devs of the future!  Keep them just below my level so I can keep a job will ya?!  Thanks for everything Sal, I really look forward to seeing what you do in the future.

* From Bernesser - I knew by snagging Liss in mod 3 for game-time that he would be willing to do some “different” things with the project. When I proposed we do it in java, I knew he would be in for the risk. This is a testament to his ability for risk taking and his curiosity at large for programming. It was great working with you and I am always impressed by your ability to learn and execute extremely quickly. Overall, between the help you provided me in mod 1 in echo and this project, I don’t think I would be nearly the same programmer without ya. You are gonna crush it in your career. One thing to work on is don’t get so mad/upset when you don’t ​*quite*​ understand something, because usually in about a 15 minutes you do. Anyway, thanks for everything man!!!!!

* From Sunny - Oh John, oh excuse me Jon, Mr. Thinks he's too good for the letter h! Well back in my day when Jons were Johns and Potato was pronounced Potato (did you do the potaaato thing in your head hah! Now I'm in your head, yes you are trying to think about something other than ol' Sunny here, well, it's too late! That super secret thing you were thinking of last night, well I know it now!). Well anyways what was I talking about, oh, uh Jon's alright. [The letter H is the most contentious letter in our alphabet](www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2013/nov/04/letter-h-contentious-alphabet-history-alphabetical-rosen)

* From Alex - We never paired nor got a chance to play basketball with Sunny so there's that but you're a really good friend man. I really enjoyed the conversations we had ever since I joined the 1602 cohort (the one nobody understands unless you're part of it). In a way, I'm glad that I had the chance to really get to know you since we both made similar life decisions in deciding to drop out from college and go into a school like Turing. I hope we can keep in touch in the future since I'm curious where you'll be at in life in the next three years. #BeLikeKris -- ALEX
