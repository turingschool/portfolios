# Admir Draganovic - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My main goal for this module was to increase my speed and understanding of programming processes as a whole. This has been the first module where I felt like I was able to make equal contributions to group projects and reason through personal projects. I may have been burning the candle at both ends for most of the module and ended up feeling very burned out. I do feel like I have met most and exceeded some of my goals for the module. My only regret is that I would have liked to make a stronger finish. Am I a an amazing programmer... no. Am I am programmer... yes.

Notes:

* Too much logic in controllers
* Using PORO's in models, which is good, but needs another PORO (reservations in cart)
* Good risk taking using selenium
* Got trapped by AJAX functionality that didn't add much to the UX
* But good work building an API before we taught you how to do that
* Tests are covering lots of cases, not just LOC
* UI looks good, but text on images is straining my eyes
* Friends became enemies became sick became friends

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Matt Pindell: Matt working with you was great. The positivity and enthusiasm you brought to the pivot was what put our group back on track after a challenging start. I am really impressed with your ability to dive into new problems. I feel that you are very well rounded not only in your technical skills but also as a person/teammate. I know your passion for learning will take you far in your career but do not let the excitement of learning something distract you from the task at hand. Hopefully one day I will get to work with you on another project because I really value and enjoy what you bring to a group

Marina Corona:  Marina I really admire the drive you have. Your ability to organize and complete tasks is an attribute I will try to emulate. When Matt and I went off on tangents about features we were exited about you were the team member that got us to focus on what was important to the project. I was really impressed by you pointing out areas that you wanted to become stronger in and taking them on. Before the project started you mentioned that you were not comfortable with styling and by the time the project wrapped up you had developed really solid front end skills. I have really enjoyed being able to learn with you. I feel like after completing this project you have a lot more faith in your abilities and I hope you continue riding that wave. You seem to be your harshest critic but I can honestly say I am impressed with the skills you have developed as a programmer.

Scott Firestone: Scott provides a brand of balanced enthusiasm that is uniquely his own. Pairing with him was always a very positive experience. Scott is great at breaking apart complex problems and being able to communicate his ideas. With Scotts ability to collaborate and problem solve I know he will have no problem becoming a part of any dev team.
### Being a Community Member

Admir, your willingness to tackle different cards and experiment with new things (the dreaded AJAX / internal APIs) was awesome kept me stoked to work on the Pivot. And while we went down that rabbit hole way too early, it was fun working on it with you.
I can only suggest that you try not to get discouraged / frustrated when things break and explode (ironic for me to say, considering my meltdown with RSpec haha - but it’s something we can both work on, it seems) because it’s going to happen - and usually the fastest progress is made when you dispassionately focus on finding a solution. Overall, you and Marina carried our team in the home stretch while I was dead, and I’m glad y’all crushed it! - Matt Pindell

Admir is super friendly and was awesome to work with. I think I would have liked to see Admir step out of his comfort zone more in the project and take on things he hadn't tried before, like styling or refactoring. It also felt that for some cards, it would take Admir longer than he initially thought and some things he didn't make into pull requests because he wasn't sure if they were worth it in the end.  I think I would have liked to see Admir try to resolve the issues that arose on his branch (or seek help) and then ultimately be able to merge the branch.  I know that Admir often would ask questions to other team members, but even seeking from mentors or other classmates is a great skill and something that would have helped him and the team.  I also think that as project manager I would have liked to see him give clearer deadlines to the project and take on more of a leadership role. - Marina Corona

I had the pleasure of pairing with Admir several times over the last module. He is  a great  person to be around and work with, offering a certain brand of tempered enthusiasm that I can relate to.  I know that he's feeling kind of burnt out now, but I hope he can destress and get back to enjoying coding soon because I'm sure he'll make for a great dev. - Scott Firestone
