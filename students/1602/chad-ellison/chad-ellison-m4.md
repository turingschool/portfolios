# Chad Ellison - M4 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to develop a deeper understanding of JavaScript.

### Thought Box
## Evaluation Criteria

### Satisfactory Progress
3: Developer completes iterations 1 through 5 with few bugs and no missing functionality. (In the real final assessment, this will involve completing one supporting feature.)
### Ruby Syntax & Style
3: Developer is able to write idiomatic and effective Ruby. Application makes good use of Object-Oriented modeling with few gaps in class identification and component extraction. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
### Rails Style & API
4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
### Javascript Syntax & Style
3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
### Testing
3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.
### User Interface
3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality
### Workflow

4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Notes & scores from your assessment rubric

### Work

#### GameTime

#### Description:
This is a remake of the classic 1979 game Asteroids. The game includes features such as enemy spaceships that shoot at you and buffs that gice you different weapons or extra lives. This app uses HTML canvas and JavaScript with a node server. Some of the challenges of this project included relearning trigonometry to draw the ship and rotate it.

### Notes & scores from your assessment rubric
145 / 150
### Extensions
* 25 points

### Functional Expectations
* 35 points - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expecations set by instructors

### User Interface
* 15 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

### Testing
* 20 points - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style
* 20 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
### Workflow
* 25 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation
* 5 points - Six to ten complaints

### Scale Up

#### Description:
One of the defining features of Rails Five is Action Cable. Action Cable allows one to integrate web sockets into a rails app for realtime updates. Most examples of Action Cable that I came across were chat applications. I wondered what it would be like to build a real-time Texas Holdem application. Texas Holdem requires several components that are available to all players (i.e. the flop, turn, river, blinds, pot, etc.) as well as components that are unique to each particular user(i.e. the pocket cards). See this blog post for more details: Rails 5 Action Cable.

Users can play with other users, Ai Players, or both-- users can even just watch Ai Players play. Feature testing was very difficult because I was not able to find very many resources for feature testing with sockets. This application uses the Deck of Cards Api for the images of playing cards. It does not use any libraries for the hand analysis / game logic; however, the game logic is well tested.

### Giving Feedback

feedback from me

to Patrick Hardy
Working on Asteroids with Patrick was a great experience. Patrickâ€™s clear communication skills and passion made pairing with him very enjoyable and productive. We were able to discuss features and solutions very openly and easily. His skills stood out through his ability to understand a problem and implement a solution quickly. For example, we had to relearn trigonometry to draw and accelerate our ship. Patrick found the correct trig equation to properly draw the ship in less than half an hour.

to Thom Pickett
It was great to pair with Thom over the last couple of months and get to know him. Thom has a deep understanding of his code and is able to implement solutions very fast. His ability to hold complex and abstract blocks of information in his mind is one of his strengths. Another one of his strengths is his persistence. I've observed Thom power through difficult problems and implement solutions to problems with little background information or context. Most of all, I have enjoyed getting to know Thom and have no doubt that he will add a lot of value to the company he ends up working for.

### Being a Community Member
From Patrick
I had a really great time working with Chad on Asteroids. I was amazed at how effortlessly Chad was able to motivate and invest days on end into the project. Despite his diligence late night coding binges, I never felt pressured to do the same. It really seemed like we both just really enjoyed working on the project, so there was never any stress or tension over working on it. I may recommend that Chad try to break goals into smaller executable pieces - e.g. when trying to integrate a multiplayer, I feel like we took on a huge task without understanding the scope of this feature. This was definitely one of my favorite projects of Turing, much because Chad was so enjoyable to work with.

From Thom
Chad kept a steady positive energy on a project that was stressful and difficult all the way through. On one of our previous projects he forced us, and this was a good thing, to take pomodoroes consistently through out the project. Even through the highs and lows and times when the atmosphere was tense, Chad was amazing at keeping communication open. He asked questions when he needed clarify things and took the time to explain his thought process. Chad had great ideas and would benefit from pushing through the struggles to solutions, before turning to others. He is an extremely dedicated programmer. The last night of our Trelora project, we were not happy with where it was. We had implemented base functionality several days before, and even built most of the extras that our clients had asked for, but we were both unhappy with it still, and so Chad suggested an all nighter. Chad kept the energy going and the project moving forward. Chad kept the standards up throughout the project, even when we felt pressed for time. He questioned everything he noticed that he thought could be refactored or completely redesigned. He is very thoughtful about everything he does.

### Playing a Part

I paired with module one students from the front end program beyond the scheduled times we were assigned in module 4. On one occasion I stayed paired with a student for about 4 hours going through JavaScript exorcisms, explaining several principles and ways of breaking down problems.
