### Peer Feedback
##Feedback from Brian Rippeto
Chad is someone I always look forward to pairing with for a number of reasons. First of all, he has an inherit passion for programming that is contagious. It doesn’t feel so much like work but an exciting new challenge every time we dig into a problem. He communicates clear and concise ideas that are able to be built upon. Also, he absorbs others input efficiently. He is always open to try new workflow tactics which is reflective of his willingness to grow as programmer and person.

##Feedback from Allan Blair
The Chad is a passionate student and loves to learn. He has clearly worked on his workflow and can proficiently navigate the terminal. Another strong characteristic of Chad is his communication skills. He can navigate conversations deftly and easily explain his ideas. Chad's love of learning can also make him difficult to work with. In pursuit of understanding Chad will at times slow down or even halt a workflow until he feels comfortable. In moderation this practice is beneficial for everyone to an extreme it can cripple a process. One way Chad could work better with a team is by aggregating his questions instead of several interruptions.

##Feedback from Nicholas Dorans
Chad is a beast. I was lucky enough to work with Chad on two consecutive projects. The first one was called The Gipherator. It was a cool little project where we hit the giphy API and returned random GIFs based on search parameters. Chad was super pumped when we finally returned some actual GIFs, and so was I! Our next project was Little Shop and that was another enjoyable experience. Chad was a beast on this project. He was eating up waffle cards like it was nobody’s business!! I’m sad to hear that Chad won’t be with us next module, but The Chad will return! 1511 is gonna miss you. Good luck with the baby, man!

##Feedback from Nate Venn
I have paired with Chad on numerous homework assignments and exercises and I was fortunate to have him as a teammate in Little Shop. Chad inspires me in many ways. First off he is the kindest and most polite person I know. In this regard he is just a pleasure to work with and be around.  Chad also actively seeks out help when needed and encourages good collaboration  with his teammates. His enthusiasm and eagerness to learn and understand concepts is one of the main reasons I most enjoy pairing with him. I am a better programmer because of him.  I think Chad would really benefit in slowing down when times get tough and focus on the bigger picture. He is an excellent problem solver but one thing that I noticed is that when we hit a bug he would hastily dive into the code. Its definitely not a negative but I think it would help him solve the issue sooner if he approached it with eagle eyes compared to tunnel vision. To his credit he always seemed to fix the bug!

##Feedback for Brian Rippeto
During the module Brian and I paired several times to practice CRUD functionality. A few of the things that make Brian a great collaborator are his solid workflow and process tackling a problem. Every time I work with Brian, I learn new keyboard shortcuts. He is also very good at navigating his way through unfamiliar material. His decisions about how much time to spend on a problem and what to focus on made our pairing sessions very productive. Brian’s lightheartedness and positive attitude also made debugging an enjoyable process as well as a learning experience.

##Feedback for Allan Blair
Allan is a very strong programmer. He is very aware of what his code is doing, and he is a very efficient debugger. It was rare that we would spend more than 30 minutes troubleshooting a problem during our traffic spy project. I have no doubt that Allan will become a great developer; he works very hard and has strong technical abilities. I think Allan could benefit by continuing to develop his soft skills as he works with others, specifically by communicating how he intends to tackle a problem and his thought process along the way.

##Feedback for Nate Venn
I have paired with Nate on several occasions including our most recent project. Some of the things that make Nate a strong programmer are his drive and his ability to pick things up fast. He did his last several projects while learning Vim. He pursued some of the most difficult components of our app, and tackled them. Every time I pair with Nate, he is always encouraging and positive. Even when we are stuck on a bug, the energy he brings to a pairing session is never stressful, and  always cultivates an environment for learning. Nate is also great to work with because he genuinely considers the input of his collaborators even when he already has his own solution to a problem. Continuing to get better at TDD (not that he is not good at TDD) will make Nate an even stronger programmer. I have no doubt that Nate’s drive, technical ability, and ability to learn, will make him a great developer.

##Feeback for Nicholas Dorans
I had the pleasure of working with Nick on the rails mini-project and the little shop project (custo-candy-co). One of Nick's strengths as a developer that immediately stood out to me is his ability to problem solve and figure out forgien features. Nick is very methodical in his approach. This was evidenced through the way he thoroughly reviewed the pull requests and made sure we did the same. He also carefully read through the error messages when we were debugging and his insights benefitted our group significantly. Lastly, Nick is just enjoyable to work with and be around. He constantly kept the mood light and helped us enjoy our project more.

### Evaluated Projects
## [Traffic Spy](https://github.com/amaxwellblair/rush-hour-skeleton)
* Evaluated by Andrew Carmer
* Notes: All base functionality except for missing payload in posting payload; implemented client registration from browser interface. Great use of testing at all levels. Make sure that you test attributes and relationships instead of just existance. Good use of POROs to delegate responsibilities.

# Scores
* Functional Expectations
  3: Application fulfills base expectations

* Test-Driven Development
  4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

* Fundamental Ruby & Style
  4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic
  4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.

  4: Application expertly breaks components out to view partials and makes use of both built-in and custom-written view helpers.

  ## [Little Shop](https://github.com/chadellison/custo_candy_co)
  * Evaluated by Andrew Carmer
  Notes:
  * Logic in views, only a couple times but needs to be refactored
  * Views also had a fair amount of conditionals
  * Refactoring the DB design would have been very helpful

  # Scores
  * Feature Completeness
  3: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented
  * Views
  3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts
  * Models
  3: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring
  * Testing
  3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features
  * Usability
  3: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready
  * Workflow
  3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

### Playing a Part

  * Participated in the computability theory club that meets on Wednesday mornings before class. I have a deep interest in machine learning and computational processes, especially as they relate to artificial intelligence
  * Part of the 1602 greeting party that was hosted just before the module began, and I also volunteerd to help the upcoming 1603 module with prep-work
  * Active participant in all posse meetings before school--worked with posse on all challenges and worked with other students in our posse on their projects

### Mid Module Assessment
* Evaluator: Andrew Carmer
* Struggled a little with implementing some Rails features, but with a little prompting he was able to figure things out.
* Understands components but maybe not how they work together.
* Some trouble with basic rails features
* Used testing for most of it, but was urged to really use tests and the error messages to drive development.

# Scores
* Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking
  3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them

* Ruby Syntax & Standard Library
  3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby

* Rails Syntax & API
  2: Developer is generally able to utilize Rails, but shows confusion or shallow knowledge about what Rails provides

* Rails Style
  3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

* Testing
  3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development

* Collaboration
  3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### End of Module Assessment
Evaluator: Andrew

* Testing started a little slow. Initially didn't connect attempts to levels, but as soon as it was recognized he corrected to tests so attempts where built off of levels.
* Collaboration was really good
* Had a little struggle going writing class methods but with a little questioning and prompting developer was able to generate the ideas himself.
* Ruby implementation was ok - used a while loop - but we rewrote it with map.with_index and the logic was nearly identical.
* Overall I think developer is ready to move to mod3, but developer was directed to continue to work on testing, and some ruby/rails syntax as well as ActiveRecord.

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking
* 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them

### Ruby Syntax & Standard Library
* 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement more than one solution in Ruby through refactoring

### Rails Syntax & API
* 3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs occasional guidance

### MVC & Rails Style
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

### 5. Testing
* 3: Developer writes tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development with guidance

### 6. Collaboration
* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck


### Notes: 

* Feels like goals were pretty much accomplished
* Feels good with basic ActiveRecord
* Work on not getting tunnel vision when you have problems
* Focus on modeling your databases
*
