### Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to learn as much as I could about apis--namely,
consuming them and serving them. I also wanted to become more familiar with
javascript.

### End of Module Assessment
## Evaluation Criteria
### Ruby Style
* **3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components**

### Rails Syntax & API
* **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### Testing
* **3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.**

### 4. Progression/Completion
* **3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.**

### 5. Workflow
* **4: Developer commits every 15 minutes**

Notes & scores from your assessment rubric
- Explain the use of `.require("post")` in your strong params
- Not testing for `204` response on delete, as noted in the spec
- Typo in your routes. Probably didn't use postman or curl to check your API as requested by the spec.
- Other than that, your internal API tests provide good coverage
- Search results doesn't include total number of stores
- Good use of VCR on service, but should also be used in model and feature tests
- Thanks for not committing your cassettes
- Model is good
- Service has logic pretty well broken out
- Not ideal that everything is hard coded, but you were on the path to wiring up the form
- Test could do a better job of covering the user story. Only testing for name right now.

### Work

#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chadellison/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

In This project we served up our own api endpoints and used active record to
make complex business intelligence queries.

Notes: 3 Failing tests - 2 BI, one Find 128 Tests 96.67% Test coverage Chose not to alter data coming in - uses serializers to deal with prices etc Individual controllers with index/show, except for find/random/find_all Zero to little ruby

* Completion
3: Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.

* Test-Driven Development
4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

* Code Quality
3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

* API Design
4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

* Queries
4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

#### Trelora Appointments

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chadellison/trelora_appointments)
* [Original Assignment](https://turingschool.slack.com/files/neight/F1D3S57S4/Trelora_Appointments)

In This project constructed an app for maximizing efficiency for scheduling appointments. We did this by displaying a route for each of a Trelora employee's appointments for a given day on a map. We implemented functionality
to pass in a new address to see which appointments were nearest to it, and consequently, the best employee to add the new appointment to.
In this app we:

* consumed several apis, including the google calendars and google maps apis
* used omniauth to implement a server to server handshake to access calendar data of multiple employees.
* served up our own api to display the appointment data on a google map via ajax calls
* experimented heavily with javascript to handle the majority of front end functionality
* allowed all button functionality on the landing page to also be handled by passing params into the landing page

## Community

### Giving Feedback

feedback from me

to Chris Soden
Christopher:  Chris was very easy to work with. He had a positive attitude and a pleasant disposition every time he interacted with the group. Chris knows his stuff and asked helpful questions. I think Chris could benefit from initiating more dialogue about the project through slack and github on specific features he is working on and features that others are working on. That being said, all of my interactions with Chris were very positive.

to Sal Espinosa
Sal was very laid back and easy to work with. He was very patient and solves problems in a very methodical and diplomatic way, asking for feedback and the thoughts of his other team members while making suggestions. Sal is very technically skilled and I enjoyed learning from him. I also appreciate him taking the time to pair on some features that he was stronger in.

to Thom Pickett
It was great to pair with Thom on the Trelora appointments project. Thom had a deep understanding of the code at all times and was able to implement solutions very fast. His ability to hold complex and abstract blocks of info in his mind is one of his strengths. Thom is also very persistent. We had several curve balls during the project, some of which we hours on with little to no progress. A few times I did not think we were going to find a solution on our own and Thom would continue to bulldoze through until finding a solution. For these reasons Thom is a strong programmer. One way Thom could grow is by taking a more methodical approach to implementing solutions. Pairing with Thom was a great experience, however, and I was glad to partner with him and learn from him.

Feedback to me

from Chris Soden
Chad, I really respect how hard you worked on this project. I worked with you on the charts and I was impressed by how effectively you tackled the problems. You also did more than anyone else to make me feel included in the group and I really appreciate that. As a group, I think we did a great job of being able to split up and still communicate and coordinate our individual progress.

from Jon Bernesser
Yo chad, I was thoroughly impressed with you tenacity to attack this project. You were eager to take challenging cards and executing them. You stayed late, even tho you have a super long commute. I can be a dick sometimes, and your ability to stay calm and ground things into reality was awesome. I think we butt heads a few times on how things should be implemented because we both seem want it done the way we see the problem. We both wanted to crush this project and seemed like thatâ€™s where problems (if any?) arose.
It terms of growth, I would try to be a bit more compromising. A lot of times we either went with your way or my way, but we never actually found common ground to sit on, which is a problem for me too. Also, although it was all from the heart and hard work, feature extension work that was being done late Tuesday after Sal and I were determined to wrap things up definitely put us in a hole to crawl out on Wednesday which was way too close to comfort for me. You seemed calm throughout all of it, but finding bugs in features we thought were done days ago was very stressful. That being said, I think your technical skill is super strong have no doubt with the tenacity you show that you will get even better, keep it up!

from Thom Pickett
Chad kept a steady positive energy on a project that was stressful and difficult all the way through. He forced us, and this was a good thing, to take pomodoroes consistently through out the last few weeks. As this was a difficult project, there were lots of highs and lows and times when the atmosphere was tense, but Chad was amazing at keeping communication open. He asks questions when he needs to and takes the time to explain his thought process. Chad has great ideas and would benefit from pushing through the struggles to solutions, before turning to others. He was extremely dedicated. The last night of the Trelora project, we were not happy with where it was. We had implemented base functionality several days before, and even built most of the extras Robbie and Keith had asked for, but we were both unhappy with it still, and so Chad suggested an all nighter. Chad kept the energy going and the project moving forward. Chad kept the standards up not just that night even though we felt pressed for time, and questioned everything he noticed that he thought could be refactored or completely redesigned. He is very thoughtful about everything he does.

### Playing a Part

I worked with several students from different modules on various exercises-- ie, chess app and all allergy recipes
worked on rails engine with other students after completion
regularly paired with students from different modules on exercises / side projects (Nate and Hedy)

### Main Take Away

The biggest takeaway from my posse, was to not embrace insufficiency during the times you "feel" like a bad coder or insufficient.
