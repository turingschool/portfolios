## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

At the beginning of this module I was focused on learning as much Ruby as possible to try and build up a strong foundation for the rest of the modules. I had a small amount of programming experience from college and that was definetly able to to get help me get a strong start to the module even though we moved past the limits of my experience by the end of week two.

By the end of the module my goals have shifted to emphasize working with other people. Our first group project showed me I can learn a lot more working with other people and have since tried to focus on getting better at working as a team and getting as much pair programming in as I can.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jwashke/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

Implemented a command line version of the game Mastermind. The first project of the module. Was fun to dive right into a big project at the start of the module. 

Assessed By: Tess

Notes: Nice to see how many classes were broken out. Would recommend breaking out a 'printer' class

##### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

##### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods and collections

##### 3. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use and application fulfills base expectations from the project spec

##### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into logical methods to encapsulate functionality.

#### Binary Search Tree

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jwashke/binary_search_tree.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown)

Implemented a Binary Search Tree with the ability to add nodes, remove nodes, find nodes within the tree, and find the health of the tree. This project felt a lot smaller then mastermind even though they are probably about the same size. This project had a much higher thinking to coding ratio then probably any other project this module.

Notes:
* Use the spec/project def to drive your test writing, and then add more expected situations
* Splitting up files is good, but you went a little to far


##### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

##### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jwashke/sorting_suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

Implemented four classic computer science sorting algorithms. bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, and merge sort. 

Assessed By: Nate

##### Functional Expectations

* 3: All three sort classes work as expected

##### Testing

* 4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases
such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.

##### Ruby Style

* 3: Code is a readable and effective implementation of the algorithm. Has fewer than 4 "what on earth is this?" lines of code.

##### Organization

* 4: Version control maintains the codebase

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jwashke/battleships)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

Implemented the classic board game Battleship with a terminal interface. Game supports a four by four board with two ships per side and one player playing against the computer. This was easily the largest programming project I had ever done. I learned a ton about breaking problems down and how bad design decisions up front can massively slow down the later stages of the project. My biggest takeaway from this project was more pseudocode and planning out my project on paper instead of just jumping into coding right away.

Assessed by: Nate

Notes:

* Neat testing tricks
* Keep learning more about module uses
* Logic is well tested. UI could be better tested.

##### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

##### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

##### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

##### 4. REPL Interface

* 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations to improve the gameplay

##### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

## Team

### Projects

#### HTTP Yeah you know me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marinacor1/HTTPYYKM)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

Implemented a basic HTTP server in ruby that could accept GET and POST requests to a variety of paths and generate responses. The first group project of the module taught me a lot about working as a team instead of an individual. As an introvert I found the adjustment very difficult at first, but by the end of the project it was a massive relief to be able to work together to solve our toughest bugs and problems. This project made me a pair programming believer.

### Posse Challenges

#### College Scorecard

This was a tough challenge to start the module with and I first found the CSV files very intimidating. By asking my group too many questions I was able to figure out what was happening and that familiarity with CSV files ended up being very helpful during Black Thursday

### Giving Feedback

* **Marina Corona** I was lucky to work with Marina on HTTP Yeah You Know Me. She is a very knowledgable and capable programmer and a very effective communicator. Marina's biggest strengths lie in her ability to break a problem down into its logical components and focus on each step individually creating a stronger project overall, and her ability to stay calm during even the most stressful situations. Several times during the project I found myself very frustrated and stressed out while trying to solve a particular problem or bug. Marina was always calm and collected and through talking it out was able to lead us to find a solution together.
*  **Deb Hamal** Deb is an amazing person to work with and a good friend. We were paired up on Black Thursday and she was very clear about her goals for the project and how she wanted to accomplish it. She helped me improve my pairing skills and was an asset at all levels of the project from testing to implementatin to pull requests. My only advice for Deb is that she needs to be more confident in her ability. She is a strong programmer and good problem solver who can do great work, but she seems to have trouble believing it. I am happy to work with Deb in the future and hope that the more projects she accomplishes the more she will realize she is a strong competent programmer. 
*  **Jennifer Soden** I paired with Jennifer Soden on refactoring Engima and have paired with her many times before. Her positivity and communication skills are an asset to any group situation. She is capable of explaining her thought process very well and is an able programmer. The best advice I can give her is to work on reading code slowly and to try to stop her brain from filling in gaps, but rather focus on what each line and block is evaluating to and returning.


### Being a Community Member

* I feel very lucky to have gotten Josh as my partner for HTTP. Josh is very strong in both his ability to debug and think big picture about a project. From the beginning, he sketched out several options for the overall structure of the project.  He taught me how to use the architecture of a project to understand the overall purpose.  Besides his clear knowledge and comfort with Ruby, he is a great partner to work with.  He has a strong work ethic and was flexible when it came to divying projects.  I think Josh is a great asset to our cohort and am excited to work with him in the future. **Marina Corona**

* Josh is extremely knowledgable and can explain some difficult parts of code or concepts that really helps for someone who is still really new to all of it. Much like myself, Josh seems to go with flow pretty easily, which is awesome, but may also mean a slight lack of leadership?
Working with Josh was great, I honestly can't think of anything he could do to make him better since we only worked together for such a short period of time. Thanks Josh! **Colin Osborn**

*  Josh is very good at explaining and re-explaining concepts such as relationships, and basic ruby syntax, and listening to suggestions on code. He is quite confident in his abilities and in able to assert himself without being overwhelming. Keep on keeping on. **Jennifer Soden**
