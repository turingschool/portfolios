### Feedback for me

   "Dude you are a baller. I appreciated your attention to the small details of the project - especially the final front end styling - that I think took our project from solid to awesome. I also respect the confidence you have in your abilities. It is inspiring to watch you throw commands at your terminal, confident that you can figure out what to do if the unexpected happens.
   I do think you need to watch out that you don't get overconfident, or let your attention to detail make you lose sight of the bigger goals. I think it might have been overconfidence that led to that messed up view getting pushed to master, because I know that if you had looked at the page before submitting the PR you never would have let it get pushed up. And similarly, I think your zeal for clean code meant that you pulled out the mapping from the homes index view without realizing that we needed to pass it some data, and that's what messed up the push to heroku. I definitely accept responsibility for both of these as well because I think I merged it and didn't look or didn't catch either of them before they got to master.
   Overall though, all's well that ends well and this project was my favorite one at Turing. I think that's in large part because I got to work with someone who was supremely capable and confident, and would produce good code that would fit in with the rest of the work being done. It led to some beautiful results that I'm proud to have been a part of. It seemed like you were constantly working to make our project better - in the really visible ways like the georgeous styling, but also in the invisible ways, like those dozens of controller tests. It was a privilege to work with you, and if you were being serious about working on gametime together then definitely count me in." - **Ashwin Rao**


   I was super impressed with your coding skills. You are able to hold a lot of moving parts in your head at once and are very fast to come up with solutions to complicated problems. Also, your knowledge of ancillary skills such as working with AWS, controller tests etc were very helpful and demonstrate the time and energy you apply to programming. Sometimes, throughout the project, I wondered whether you were being challenged enough. Although I know you had several late nights diving deep into a feature, I wonder if there are more ways that you can continue to push your skills, as the Turing curriculum might be straightforward for you. Also, I am so happy about your attitude towards your work; "I'm doing rails stuff all weekend anyway so I'll take on anything" - is awesome! It's very cool that you can work on this stuff all the time without much stress and are happy for more challenges. - **Patrick Hardy**

   Josh volunteered to take on a lot of the necessary javascript in our personal project, for which I am ever in his debt.  He was great to work with.  We both came together to discuss issues then went back to working on our separate parts of the project.  I really have no constructive criticism for him.  He will be awesome as long as he continues displaying the same level of dedication. **Drew**

### Feedback from me:

  **Ashwin Rao** "Ashwin: I had a great time working with you. I felt like your organization really pushed the project forward and was key to getting a lot done. With a lot of projects I have spent time unsure of what we were doing as a group or what I was supposed to be doing. But you did a great job keeping us all on track and always focusing on small obtainable goals.
  You also were able to deliver several key features on your own. A good example is the JQuery functionality, it was obviously a difficult feature but you stuck with it and delivered it when you said you would.
  You seem very focused on following a TDD approach, which I appreciate. The best advice I can give you is when TDDing remember to drop down to non feature tests during implementation. Controller tests haven't been as much of a focus but using model tests to drive your model methods and poro tests to drive your poro methods is still a good idea.
  Overall though I had a great time working with you and I think our projects reflects how well we worked together as a group. I would be happy to work with you again."

  **Patrick Hardy**   "Patrick: I had a great time working with you on the Pivot. Your a strong programmer who is able to get stuff done. You seemed capable in all aspects of the projects from the database level stuff to the javascript we haven't even learned yet. And your a very chill group member who ranks among the easiest to get along with of all the people I've worked with, Ultimately its hard to ask for more than that in a group project.
  Constructively I would say keep working on your styling skills. Specifically just applying a final layer of polish to your views. I think with styling, its the little details, in how things line up and the margins that really set sites apart.
  Overall though I had a great time working with you and I think our projects reflects how well we worked together as a group. I would be happy to work with you again."
