## Feedback: Self-Solicited

### To me:

**Drew:** Josh and I have worked on 2 projects together between Mod 3 and 4.  Both were great experiences.  He always does what he says he will and enjoys all facets of the projects (or at least doesn’t blatantly hate them like me).  The biggest issue I can think of is that often he will think of an idea and start to implement it without getting input from others first.  It’s not generally an issue so much as something where it would be nice to have some input and discussion about how something should work/look/turn out.  Really it’s pretty minor since the issue is with doing more work than necessary.  I would really appreciate the opportunity to work with Josh again in the future.

**Jared:** I like working with Josh. GameTime being our second project together, I knew before starting that he deserved the title of GameTime prom queen with his rapid and thorough understanding of problems and how to solve them. Josh is particularly good at getting up to speed with others' janky-ass code and knowing what's going wrong or how to make it better. My only comment on this would be that sometimes a simple "why did/didn't you do it this way?" can occasionally come across as condescending. So just a word of caution regarding tone in situations like that.

**Mark:** Josh is every bit the prom queen that he has been built up to be. He was great to work with and got a ridiculous amount of work done in such a short amount of time. He was great to work with and excited to see what he accomplishes post-Turing.

### From me:

**Drew:** We worked together on projects for 4 weeks almost back to back and I haven't gotten completely sick of you yet, so thats pretty high praise. You're a strong developer and are obviously passionate about back end and dev ops which is exciting to see. I would like to see you open your heart up to the front end a little bit more, even if you know you don't like working with it, being well rounded and familiar with the entire stack could be beneficial in your future career. Overall though I'm happy to work with you more as you are never afraid to dig into a difficult problem and are a pleasure to work with. 10/10 Would yell at you to fix shit again.

**Jared:** It was cool getting to work with you again since Little Shop. Talking to you coming into Mod 4 you seemed to have pretty low confidence in your ability and where you were at. Working with you in Gametime I definitely don't think you have anything to worry about. You implemented a large amount of the difficult logic by yourself and never hesitated in tackling a difficult problem. The best feedback I can give you is to communicate with the group more, we had some trouble getting everything together at the end and more communication throughout the process would have smoothed out a lot of those issues. But that was an issue with the entire group as a whole and not just you. Overall I'm excited to see what you do next and a little sad to see you go back home Friday. I'm happy to work with you again in the future and will hit you up next time I'm in SoCal.

**Mark:** You're really good at styling, and I learned yesterday your really good at Rails too. You're just killing it all around. You're a great developer, and very easy to work with. Even though we're both completely exhausted I'm pretty proud of what we did manage to get done, and I think a lot of that is due to you. I would be more than happy to work with you again anytime in the future. My only criticism is that I wasn't in your group for the exclusive pokemon stickers. Feels bad man.
