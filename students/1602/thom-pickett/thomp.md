# Thom Pickett - Module 1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission
>
Mostly just to get out of classroom A. I'd like to start looking into more of what's actually causing problems in my code and less just making it work. I'd also like to work more with pairing and become more successful at it.

### End of Module Assessment

#### Notes

Assessed By: Horace
Challenge: Option 1 - Shopping List

    * Fluid with test definition and workflow
    * Pretty comfortable moving between the 2 class and defining a new class when needed
    * Comfortable defining methods and tracking arguments between them
    * Sometimes needed a little guidance on data structure traversal but once we were moving in the
    right direction it was fine
    * Still would love to see your workflow (typing and file manipulation) getting faster

#### Scores


> Students will be evaluated according to the following rubric:
###### Ruby Syntax & API
3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts
###### Completion and Progress
3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.
###### Testing
3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design
###### Workflow
3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts
###### Collaboration
3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process
###### Enumerable & Collections
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### Mid Module Assessment

#### Notes

Assessed By: Tess

    * Challenge: Player Tracking
    * Everything was pretty smooth. Only rough point was the tiles. Just some confusion of what it was counting.

##### Description

> The purpose of this project was to design a linked list using incursion or recursion. We also had to create methods to modify our linked list without using a lot of rubys in built methods.

#### Notes

    Assessed By: Horace

    love the deep sonorous voice of the player
    starting to more cleanly grasp conceptual steps involved in each process
    still dealing some cruft both in the small (i.e. method-level structure) and in the large (i.e. overall algorithmic proces)
    keep working on pseudocode and outlining our processes -eventually want to get to a point where code reads as a clear expression of whatever the outline for a process would be
    would love to see more of the responsibilities moving into the LInkedList itself (or even into the nodes) than in the top-level JB object
    like the improvement on iterative processing -keeping the loops more contained and focused

#### Scores
>###### Functional Expectations
3: Application fulfills all base expectations
###### Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
###### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
###### Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
###### Looping or Recursion
3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thompickett/enigma_once_more)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

#### Description

> The purpose of this project was to use enumerables in a real context. To practice TDD to break our program up into logical components. It's called crypto on my github page and rubric.

#### Notes

    Assessed By: Meeka
    Evaluation Rubric
    The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### Scores

> ###### Overall Functionality
3: Application encrypts, decrypts, and cracks files as described
###### Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
###### Test-Driven Development
3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.
###### Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thompickett/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

#### Description

## Team

### Projects

#### Http Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL class project](https://github.com/thompickett/http_yeah)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

#### Description
> In this project we built a server to introduce HTTP, the protocol that runs the web. It was also the first project we worked on as a team.  

#### Notes
    Assessor: Lovisa
    completed iteration 0-4, does not follow the spec fully but has all functionality included
    very good tests, easy to read, well organized. Could use some DRYing up in terms of lvars and shared data
    overall very nice project, well factored and mostly easy to read.
    there's opportunity to DRY up some functinoality in modules.

    The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### Scores

>
###### Overall Functionality
3: Application implements iterations 0 4
###### Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
###### Test-Driven Development
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
###### Breaking Logic into Components
4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

#### Sunshine Thursday

* [GitHub URL class project](https://github.com/Jbern16/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

#### Description
> In this project we trudge through nonsensical data
with specs ask for different things than the spec harness checks for.

#### Notes
    Assessed By: Nate
    Good encapsulation of repository setup, but could be one step better
    Nice use of Open struct in tests. Fast tests!
    Compact is a red flag. Probably want to use find_all/select
    Blocks. Nice. Could have been clearer, but I like your moxie.
    Good use of module with CSVLoader
    Dropping vowels in the name of code sanitation is zealous

#### Scores

3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5
###### Test-Driven Development
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
###### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
###### Fundamental Ruby & Style
3.5: Application sses blocks, but poorly, and it causes poor variable names.
###### Enumerable & Collections
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
###### Code Sanitation
4: Zero complaints

## Community

### Giving Feedback
> Feedback: from: Thomas Pickett, to: Sal Espinosa, Sal is great at contributing his ideas without overriding the collaborative process. If we teamed up again, we could take turns on who's driving to shake up the dynamics of the group.

> Feedback: from: Thomas Pickett, to: Christopher Soden, Chris is extremely curious about how things work in ruby. We could shake up the dynamics of the group by alternating driver/navigator positions. Chris could work on his mechanical skills to navigate his computer better.

> Feedback: from: Thomas Pickett, to: Ling Tran, Ling works really hard to understand why things work, and not just how they work. We could of have slowed down a little as a team to stay on the same page with each other.

> Feedback: from: Thomas Pickett, to: Deb Hamel, Deb stayed very organized and meticulous about naming objects in our code and and our workflow as well. Our workflow being branch names, and commit messages, and pull requests. I really appreciated that as itâ€™s something I struggle with, and it kept our project nice and tidy. She also kept an eye out for edge cases and refactoring as we went along so we had less cleanup at the end. Deb mostly seems to struggle with confidence, but she knows this already. When Deb is more confident she stays
more engaged, and gives more input. As a team we could work more on creating an environment where she feels comfortable contributing.

### Being a Community Member
> Feedback: from: Ling Tran, to: Thomas Pickett, Thom was detailed with TDD and so I learned to be more disciplined with tests. As a team, we could have spent a few more minutes discussing the problem first before just diving into the tests so that we could have more context to the challenge. Thom is curious and likes learning, so having discussions was good. Perhaps as someone who has already gone through the module, he can approach teaching through asking questions more.

>Feedback: from: Christopher Soden, to: Thomas Pickett, Thomas had done the enigma project so he had a clear understanding of the program logic. I think the whole team worked well together sharing and discussing ideas to improve and refactor the project code. Something the team could do better: we should have run the unit tests before we started to ensure we had a solid baseline.

> Feedback: from: Sal Espinosa, to: Thomas Pickett, It's great to bounce ideas around with Thom. Multiple times in our short session (and in other interactions we've had), I felt he helped me to think through the problem, poked holes in some of my initial thoughts, and provided ideas for other ways to approach the issue at hand. It's hard in a short session, but I think as a group we could potentially do a better job of sharing the 'driving' responsibility to make sure it didn't feel like Thom and I were telling Chris what to do the whole time.

> Feedback: from: Deborah Hamel, to: Thomas Pickett, Thom was extremely collaborative and a great partner to work with. We were able to set and accomplish specific goals for each iteration and I feel like our project was a success. I was able to get great practice and improve my workflow during our pair project and I appreciated his patience and willingness to let me drive. I learned a lot from Thom and he was always open to my feedback and changes. I would like to become more confident with coding and know we could have done more experimenting and risk taking if I had been more assertive. I believe Thom will also take more risks and experiment more as his already insightful skills grow.

### Playing a Part

    I was on the Student Advisory Board, went and worked with classmates at union station outside of class. I paired with incoming students and got them set up on screen hero since I had done it before. I also participated in environment variables.

## Review

### Notes


### Outcome

# Portfolio Rubric

Your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.


* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.


* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.

OUTCOME: PROMOTED
