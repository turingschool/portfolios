### Mid Module Assessment
Assessed by: Andrew

1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking: 3
2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library: 3
3. Rails Syntax & API: 3
4. Rails Style: 2.5
5. Testing: 3
6. Collaboration: 2.5

##### Notes:
* Keep all logic out of views.
* Need to communicate more during pairing, make it clear what thought process is being pursued so that it's clear what intentions are.
* Would have been higher (passing) scores on the final assessment.


## Team Projects

#### Little Shop: ToolChest
Team: Ashwin Rao, Chris Soden

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kamiboers/toolchest)
* [Waffle](https://waffle.io/kamiboers/toolchest)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

This website was an online commerce platform where users can rent tools on specific dates.


##### Scores:
Assessed By: Andrew Carmer

1. Feature Completeness: 3
2. Views: 3
3. Controllers: 3
4. Models: 3.5
5. Testing: 3
6. Usability: 3
7. Workflow: 3

##### Notes:
* Strong project overall. Needs some refactoring, additional use of partials.
* Rebasing and squashing commits could be done to a greater extent. Communicate via comments as practice for real-world interactions.
* Consider the user's expeectations in link placement for navigation around the site.
* Tests are low in number but overall robuts. Utilize stubbing to streamline the spec. More specific assertions about content and its location on the page.
* Styling is impressive for this point in module 2, needs more polish before real-world deployment.

#### Rush Hour
Team: Thom Pickett, Jon Bernesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thompickett/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

##### Scores:

1. Functional Expectations: 3
2. Test-Driven Development: 3.5
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3.5
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 4
6. View Layer: 3
7. Workflow: 3

##### Notes:
* Server looks great, very clean and good refactoring.
* Avoid redundant testing, use more specific titling in tests. Separate controller/model/feature tests distinctly.
* Distinguish between ActiveRecord and Ruby, seek easier ways to solve problems, simpler ways of navigating relationships between tables.
* Class names should reflect all of the responsibilities of the class.

#### Mini Project: Gifstagram

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kamiboers/gifstagram)

## Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

**Ashwin Rao:** "Working on a project with you pushed me to grow rather than remaining in my comfort zone during the project. That extra push helped me to achieve and learn more than I otherwise might have, and I deeply appreciate it.
You helped our team to stay nimble and focused throughout the project.  You had an impressively logical approach to every problem, and the emphasis that you put on developing and fulfilling tests and user stories helped to keep the group on track and solving problems in an iterative manner. 
I came to appreciate just how flexible and open you often could be to others' ideas, no matter how sudden the change in direction or focus would be for the group. 
You're great at this, and I think that you will undoubtedly be a strong member of any team. At times I think that your focus and directness can come across as very intense in a way that some members of your team could find confrontational. I think that your legal background plays a significant part in your delivery, and I think that I understand that because at times people misconstrue my directness in conversation. But, this kind of miscommunication is a loss for both sides, because it makes it harder for you to make yourself heard, and harder for others to understand your ideas.
Every group is different, and I think that being sure to read your team members will help you to get your ideas across without losing your audience. I'm glad to have gotten to know you over the course of this project and I'd absolutely be happy to work with you again."

**Jon Bernesser:** "Jon was an absolutely bulletproof teammate on our Rush Hour project. He’s well known for his technical abilities in our cohort, and I got to see his skill firsthand.  Jon was able to keep us moving forward any time that we hit the slightest snag.
I was hugely impressed by Jon’s coding, but I enjoyed his sense of humor more. Even when group members disagreed about how to solve a certain problem, Jon’s good humor and openness kept any difference of opinion from feeling like a disagreement or creating strife in our group.
Jon's balance of raw technical ability with a cool, friendly demeanor will make him invaluable in any team environment. Rush Hour was the smoothest and most enjoyable project that I’ve worked on at Turing as a result and I’d be overjoyed to partner with him in the future."

**Chris Soden:** "You have been an excellent team member. Your logical approach to complex problems kept us grounded in moments where we could have gotten lost in minute details. Because you were able to bring us back to fundamentals, our team always had direction. You should never hesitate to speak up in those moments of indecision or conflict.
Chris, your'e a really solid programmer. I appreciated getting to know you better over the course of this project and think that I could learn from your problem solving and your consistently productive communication with the group."

### Feedback Received

**From Jon B:** "Kami was a joy to work with in rush-hour. Not only is she a skilled coder but her calming presence was invaluable for thom’s and  I often fervent discussions! She was able consistently resolve issues and bring the group together toward our common goal. This allowed us to create a project that I think we were all proud of. Without her, I don’t think we would have had nearly as a successful project. I hope we work together again soon!"

**From Chris S:** "Kami, I really appreciate your straightforward approach to the problem. And I'm very impressed with your troubleshooting skills. There were several times there was a problem with the routing and you figured out what was going on before Ashwin or I caught on. I also really appreciate your willingness to communicate so that the rest of us know where you are at in the project. You were extremely professional throughout the project."

**From Ashwin:** "It was great working with you. You are responsive and dilligent, and I've come to trust your thought process and work.
You did a tremendous job with the styling and got our team out of a number of nasty bugs when we were stuck. I also really appreciated how you owned your role as the person in charge of git and heroku. It is a really important job and I feel lucky to know that you will do what it takes to make sure we present well tomorrow morning...
It was interesting that even though today you were feeling miserable, it was when you were also paying the most attention to what Chris and I were doing! I'm not complaining at all - I know you got a lot of work done for our team during the last week and, as I said before, dug us out of a lot of bugs even when you were doing your own thing on our project at the same time. I just think that you have a lot to offer, and the more engaged you are with your teams the more they will see how good you are. And then eveybody wins.
I would be thrilled to partner again with you on a future project."

### Playing a Part

[Brin Posse](https://brin.herokuapp.com/) :   
I co-led this posse with Nick Weiland. Our focus is on exercisms and peer code review. I was excited about taking posses in a new direction, and I've enjoyed working with members of Brin. Participation of group members varied, but most showed progress on exercisms. Nick implemented a Heroku app to track self-reported progress, and most of the posse spent the hackathon adding a web scraping feature that now pulls data directly from team members' accounts and keeps track of who has been active in the last three days. Collaborating on some exercisms and receiving feedback about my code has been hugely valuable, has had a noticeable impact on the quality of my ruby code, and has helped to prepare me for comparable experiences in a professional setting.

Additionally:
* I gave a lightning talk on the fascinating topic of Agile project management.
* I participated in the hackathon with Nick W. and Jon B., attempting to build a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Elm.
* I was available for formal pairing time with 1602 students every Tuesday, and paired informally at other times.
* I recently started a weekly hiking group, hoping to help other students get outdoors and see the best parts of Colorado.
