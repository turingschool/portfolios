# Kami Boers - M3 Portfolio

### Your Mission

To learn and build on the knowledge that I've gained in the last two modules, and to develop skill, independence, and confidence as a software developer.

### End of Module Assessment

##### Notes:
- Good work on your strong params requiring item
- Your item_create method probably belongs in a support folder
- API tests effectively test user story specs
- No State on Stores view
- Had the hours array output because of a stray '='
- Other than that, basically completed all user stories
- Service could be DRYer. Using HTTParty instead of Faraday puts more of the refactoring on you. What made you decide to use that?
- Service naming isn't great. I'd like to see responsibilities broken out more, and names better reflect what the method is doing.
- Don't like to see service in the model. It's a more clear pattern for `Store` to be the interface to stores, with methods like `Store.find_by_zip` and `Store.find`
- No unit level service tests

## Community

### Giving Feedback

>**Mark Miranda:** Always a pleasure, you seem to be on the right level all the time, and you helped to keep us moving forward when we could have gotten stuck.  I liked that we were all willing to work hard to get the project done, but also equally willing to take breaks, leave the building, or do whatever it took to be productive. Your styling is by far the best that I’ve seen from our cohort, and you should be incredibly proud of your ability to put out a professional project.  Thanks for being a great teammate and a generally awesome person to be around. I’d love to work with you in the future.

>**Thom Pickett:** I was super happy to see that I was working with you again, and just like the first time that we were teammates, our group hit the ground running. Your levelheaded manner and openness made communication almost a non-issue throughout the project. You were always willing to work until a problem or bug was resolved, and you helped to keep me focused and engaged with the problem at hand.
> I like that you stand up for what you think is the right way to approach a problem, but are also flexible and easygoing when things don’t go the way that you would have chosen. Thanks for putting up with me when I was hangry :slightly_smiling_face: and I’d be happy to work with you any time.

### Feedback Received
>This is easily the best group I've been a part of. I don't think I had to worry once about what you were doing and if you were going to get it done. You were strong in your development while still being able to see the big picture. The only criticism I have was getting stuck in the rabbit hole of resetting a password on the final day when we were trying to push to heroku. I don't know if that's even a real criticism because it did get done, just not in the timebox you had set for yourself. You're easygoing and a pleasure to work with. Communication was great and never an issue. 10/10 would work with again. -**Mark Miranda**

>I'm leaving feedback for Kami, but first let me talk about the group dynamic. It was amazing, we sized each other up right away, and all came away feeling confident that the other members would be completely competent on their own. Day one we got out of Turing within five minutes of work time, and went to Union Station. We had a very honest DTR, but kept it quick. Most of this project we worked on our own, which only worked because all three of us were strict about our git workflow, stayed in constant communication on slack, and worked hard to pull our own weight. This was one of my two favorite group dynamics I've had at Turing.
“Kami was amazing to work with, she's a very hard worker and determined to figure out whatever task is ahead of her. She's is also very honest, and responds best if you're straight forward with her. She has a great sense of humor as long as she's not hungry. She tells you when she needs a break, she gives open feedback. -**Thomas Pickett**
