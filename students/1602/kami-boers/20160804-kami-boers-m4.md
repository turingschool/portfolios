# Kami Boers - M4 Portfolio

## Goals

In this module I hoped to learn as much as possible about JavaScript and front-end development, and to continue learning independently. I am happy to be connecting the disparate pieces of knowledge that I've gained over the last six months and excited to move forward and learn new tools for fun and profit. I got a lot personally and academically from reaching out to others during Mod 4, and I'm looking forward to maintaining these friendships as we take our next steps after Turing.

#### Scale-Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kamiboers/twobert)
* [Blog Post](https://wordpress.com/post/kamiboers.wordpress.com/100)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/independent_study_project.markdown)

For scale up I chose Independent Study. I worked on our game from Game Time, adding graphical polish, making it two-player and working towards real-time gameplay with socket.io.

### Feedback to Me

  From Ling Tran
> "Kami is really skilled at abstracting concepts and her naming game is strong, which are weakness areas I am working on improving. As such, I learned a lot working with her during Game Time. I don't have anything but positive things to say about Kami. Any team would be lucky to have her. Go Kami!"

  From Sal Espinosa
> "Kam! It was great to finally get to work with you, and I'm glad that we didn't get out of Turing having missed the opportunity. I kind of already knew what you could do, but it was nice to see it for myself. It was interesting to work with you and realize that you're kind of a lone wolf. We certainly had plenty of time to pair, and I never felt like you were absent in any sense, but I was always surprised to come back some morning and find that you had just gone home and demolished some code all by yourself. I know that you think that I knocked out more code, but, as I've already said, I honestly don't see it. I feel like you are responsible for both the heart and soul of the game we put together. You laid the groundwork, I came in and filled in some blanks, and then you came back and gave the game some personality. It was great. We were a team. I really love the thing we made, and I hope you're as happy with it as I am. I guess that the only thing I would say is that I would hope you don't feel like you have to do it all by yourself and that you recognize the contributions you made."

### Giving Feedback

  For Ling Tran
> "Ling is an excellent teammate who brings a lot of energy and a little levity to any group. From the very beginning, she prioritized very direct, honest communication and I think that her approach was key to the group dynamic that we established over the course of our project. Ling is an excellent coder and debugger who is able to communicate a clear vision of what she wants to create. Ling, I was so glad that you were part of my last group project at Turing, and I’m so happy that I got to go through this experience with you. I’m excited to see what you do next!"

  For Sal Espinosa
> "Sal, I feel more than fortunate to have landed in the same cohort as you. Your kind, balanced approach to life makes you a touchstone to the people around you, and you back it up with intellect and drive. You were probably the easiest, most productive person that I worked with at Turing. Even if that productivity happened in crazy midnight bursts, you always brought something impressive to the table. Your implementations kept our project moving forward at a time when we were exhausted and struggling to produce good code. You’re going to be pivotal to any organization that you join in the future, and you should be proud of the influence that you have on the people around you. I’m super glad that I got to know you, and I’m excited to see you crushing it in the future."


### Community

I made myself available for help to fellow students in my module and in module 3 in particular. I was/am a prework guide for an incoming back-end student who reaches out regularly with questions. I'm looking forward to more community involvement in and outside of the Turing community in the near future.
