## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I felt my skills in Rails, web app development, and CSS were underdeveloped. I met with my instructors and developed a specific plan to improve in these areas. This included working on the Hartl web app development, and then adding custom extensions for experience in OAuth and Rails.

### End of Module Assessment

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Hartl Tutorial

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/seeker105/sample_app)
* [Original Assignment](https://www.railstutorial.org/book)

In this Tutorial I went through the process of creating a twitter-style web app with rails. Including admin functionality, user's ability to create accounts, sign in/out, create microposts, and view microposts from other users. Users can follow and be followed by other users. I then extended it by manually imlementing OAuth sign in to GitHub. A user can link their account to their Github account and view some of their Github data. I then added the functionality for a user to create lists of other users. Users can view any other users' lists, but only a list owner can add to, or delete from a list. A user can be added to multiple lists, but cannot be added to the same list twice.

#### API Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/seeker105/git_consumer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

The goal of this project was to develop experience using an external API. The goal was to connect to an API, allow users to interact with the app and serve or send data to/from the API as needed.

### Projects

#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jbern16/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

In this project we took a previous Little Shop project (Eccentric Travel) and extended it to implement MultiTenancy. We added functionality for users to sign in, create their own online store within the site and curate their products. We set it up as a marketplace for photographers, so each store holds a collection of uploaded photographs available for download. A single photographer can set up multiple stores and upload photos into individual stores.

### Feedback to Me

Every time Chris helped me out he had a smile on his face and was very relaxing to talk with.  He is incredibly understanding and was always able to help me understand what was going on and how best to go about solving a problem.  I have struggled with visualizing what is happening for an assignment and Chris was always willing to take a few minutes and help get me to a point where I could start grasping the concepts.  After working with Chris each time I felt more confident about what I was doing and felt that I was one step closer to solving the problem.  Chris is a wonderful person to have at Turing and I am very thankful that he was willing to work with me on several occasions. - Ben Pepper

Hey Chris, you were super eager to take one more work and that was really great to see. You spotted bugs and were super attentive to details while we all paired. Further, your eagerness to drive in the beginning to learn for was great, keep doing that! However, I am a bit unsure where things started to go south, after Friday, it seemed as if you hadn't really had the same drive anymore. Even though base functionality was almost there, and I couldn't give you a definitive answer on what to work on, I did expect for you to take on some challenges and show us what you did. Don't be dependent on us to tell you what to do, be assertive and do some cool stuff, thats how you will be how you learn and get better. On Sunday/Monday, we gave you the Vendor Admin functionality but never really saw anything from it, which is fine but we didn't know if it was being worked on or not, which led Sal to do it Tuesday night, which is tough. Overall, I think with some fine-tuning with your assertiveness and a bit more communication you will grow into an awesome asset for any group and in the future, a company to have. Down to earth, genuine and good-hearted with an eagerness to learn! - Jonathan Bernesser

It was good to work with you, and nice to get to know you a little bit better. It sounds silly, but I feel like late night Pete's runs and horror stories about long code slogs are going to be some of the things that I look back on most fondly when I think about my time here at Turing. It was good to have you along for that ride since it felt like I hadn't gotten to really talk to you much before this project. In terms of feedback I would say the one thing I would advise would be to stay engaged with the tough stuff, and to speak up and take the reins a little bit more when it comes to deciding what to do next. I think sometimes it seemed like you were looking for an assignment, as opposed to hopping in to take the next waffle card. We're all in the same boat here, and our group's organization was definitely pretty flat, so don't be shy about picking for yourself what you want the next part of the project to be. Use those Waffle cards that we generate to figure out what needs done, and then snag it and assign it to yourself. Overall I think the Pivot was a pretty solid experience for our group, and was glad to have you as someone who was easy to work with as part of our team. - Sal Espinosa

Chris was very easy to work with. He had a positive attitude and a pleasant disposition every time he interacted with the group. Chris knows his stuff and asked helpful questions. I think Chris could benefit from initiating more dialogue about the project through slack and github on specific features he is working on and features that others are working on. That being said, all of my interactions with Chris were very positive. - Chad Ellison
