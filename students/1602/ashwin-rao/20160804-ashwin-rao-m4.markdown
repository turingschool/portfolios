# Ashwin Rao - M4 Portfolio

=======================================

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I want to become competent at JavaScript and be able to do basic work in Clojure this module.

I also want to get a job.

### End of Module Assessment

### Work

#### Final Points: [1054 of 1075](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w3jOqHakQ7lVmHsM0DF24-bxOIBsDJo0qLOGFTr4P0c/edit#gid=0)

It was cool to see a lot of different things come together, resulting in putting together in a day what would have take weeks in mod 1. Also it was great to be comfortable enough with CSS to put together a good looking site that also functions well.

#### ScaleUp Week 2

* [Live] (https://alphabet-animation.herokuapp.com/)

I built a greenfield single-page app using an ExpressJS server and React for the frontend. I also used CSS to do the basic styling of the page, as well as to draw a letter using HTML divs and CSS attributes.

When I was feeling burned out I got myself started learning Java.

I had a goal of animating the CSS letter so that it would transition from a capital to lowercase a but didn't get to that.

I'm happy to have satisfied my other goals of getting a deployable project with a JS backend up from sratch, hooking up the React library to it, and also now feeling like it's not a lie to put HTML/CSS on my resume.

**Meeka evaluated this project with the following results:**

* great job on blog posts
* good decision to work on custom CSS
* good decition to pivot to Java when you achieved basic understanding

#### GameTime

It was fun to learn how to use JavaScript. At the same time, this is one of those projects where I wish I were able to tear it down and start over knowing what I know now. I did learn some important lessons in making design choices. Specifically, to start building those components that are the most fundamental to the functioning of the game.

In this game, the levels should have been the first thing that we started implementing because we realized that it would be the level that would control the specificiations of the game - the number of planes, their rate of fire, etc. However, since we started with just one level, it turned into a rat's nest trying to go back the day or two before the project was due to shoehorn in the level situation.

This was a cool project. I didn't have a clue about jQuery or really how the DOM worked before this project, but it came together nicely. It was also nice to see some good programming principles, like SRP, lead me to code that wasn't a total disaster.

## Team

#### Feedback from me

**To Thom Pickett, GameTime teammate:**

"It was great working with you. I think we achieved a lot of the goals we set for ourselves - to push ourselves to write good and to not hate each other at the end. I appreciated your dedication to do things the right way, whether that was in refactoring or not being satisfied with good-enough collision detection. I have a lot of respect for your determination to solve tough problems, too. I was impressed with how you figured out the refactoring of the planes class and solved that bug the night before the project was due that kept the game from being able to start over again. I appreciated the times when we were pairing but you knew that you needed a few minutes to mess with the code yourself, and told me that's what you needed. I would encourage you to continue trying to build your awareness of when you are doing that so that your partner doesn't find himself sitting there watching you play with the code. But like I said, most of the time you did tell me that's what was going on, and that's all I really needed. Overall, a great experience. Now that I'm a bit more removed from the project, I'm satisfied with what we built. And might actually be happy with it once we get those SVGs in place :)"

**From Thom Pickett, GameTime teammate:**

"Ashwin was amazing at figuring out the big picture. He was very inventive and came up with great solutions. When we realized we couldn't use standard collision detection, Ashwin came up with an elegant solution for customizable shapes in collision detection. 

Ashwin was also great to pair with. He'd continuosly ask questions that moved the project forward, and both invited and challenged new ideas and solutions. This lead to a very creative atmoshphere."

## Review

### Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 
* **D: Community Participation**: 
* **E: Peer & Instructor Feedback**: 

### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4"s on the assessment (Module 3 requires three or more "4"s)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.


## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
