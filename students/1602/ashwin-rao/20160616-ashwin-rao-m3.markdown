# Ashwin Rao - M3 Portfolio

=======================================

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I want to set myself up to become a great developer this module. I think this will require tackling challenging problems, and pushing myself to understand the technologies I use deeply.

I also want to be available as a useful resources for my classmates and newer students.

### End of Module Assessment

* good single responsibility
* testing is very good, although comments and extraneous tests should be removed
* shouldn't be using a hash to send results to the view - better to have created a different object that had ivars that would hold the total results and list of store objects
* overall good performance that shows solid understanding of topics taught in mod 3

### Work

#### Home Validation
* [Github] (https://github.com/theonlyrao/home_validation)
* [Live] (https://home-validation.herokuapp.com/)

This was a fun project. I had wanted to do something to combat the difficulties I had when trying to find a place to live in Denver for Turing. With this project I achieved at least a start to that.

I was particularly proud of building a decent UX, as well as getting really comfortable with controller testing. As a result of these, I feel very confident about releasing this app into the wild.

**Brenna evaluated this project with the following results:**

* clean and professional UX
* some methods are very complicated, but somewhat justified by the complex calculations and manipulations that are going on
* good project overall

#### Rails Engine
* [Github](https://github.com/theonlyrao/sales_engine)

This was the hardest project I've done at Turing. I struggled a lot in setting up my environment properly, needing to migrate to a pg database halfway through the project and struggling with the setup of factory girl and database cleaner until the last day of the project.

However, through these struggles I learned some important lessons about the difference between sqlite3 and pg, the importance of not doing work until it becomes necessary to do it, and how important it is to understand the foundation of a project before moving forward.

I also enjoyed setting up the external api. It felt very simple and uncomplicated. I also feel much more comfortable with AR queries than I would have thought possible from such a short project.

**Josh evaluated this project with the following results:**

* strong AR queries
* good SRP
* creative but very wrong implementation of method to parse api queries
* strong project overall

#### Pivot

* [Live URL](http://tinystay.herokuapp.com/)

Building off of the foundation established by Little Shop group last module, my pivot team turned a tool rental site into an airbnb clone. We implemented more sophisticated features, including the required features of  multitenancy and a  more robust user management by administrators as well as extensions including a jQuery datepicker for reservation submissions and google maps integration.

This project is my favorite project at Turing. My teammates and I worked efficiently together and separately. The most rewardings times were when we would solve parts of problems on our own during the evening, and then come together the next day to put the pieces together. Invariably the merging would be easy and the resulting code would be more functional that we had hoped.

I acted as team lead on this project and was glad to see my own personal growth. While my group projects last module had decreasing amounts of tension, even in Little Shop some negativity existed. However, during and after the Pivot, I believe I successfully managed the team and my own emotions to lead us to a project about which we were all very proud.

## Team

#### Feedback from me

**To Patrick Hardy, Pivot teammate:** "One of my favorite things about this project was to see how we've both changed and grown. I think one of the things I said to you from Rush Hour was that there were some things in your setup and naming conventions that were a little hard to follow when you were driving. This time I didn't have any issues with watching you drive so that was a cool change to see. Also as usual I enjoyed your easy-going attitude to the work - it makes it very easy for the team to stay relaxed when you are there. 

I think the place I saw for improvement was with how you handled the front end stuff. It's possible we didn't do a good enough job determining what it would mean that you would do the styling, and that led to a little confusion down the road. I guess I thought that meant you were interested in producing something really polished, instead of functional. So it was difficult to watch the days go by and not see some things get fixed with the views, like the formatting of the images. I think if we did it again I guess I'd suggest being more explicit in what you think is the level of work you'd want to put into the front end stuff if that's something you volunteer or are asked to handle. And I can definitely do better in offering to do the work myself or at least being more clear in what I'd want to see.

Overall though I really enjoyed working with you as before. Some of the most fun things we did splitting up and watching it all come together at the end. The way you delivered the mapping feature overnight and the initial implementation of the calendar were strong examples of that, especially given all the tests that had to get rewritten as a result of that. And I think it is a testimony to your initial implementation of the calendar that I didn't run into any stupid bugs or problems with testing when I went back for the graying out function, and Patrick was also able to get the search up and running. Great job, especially fighting through the flu at the end!"

**To Josh Washke, Pivot teammate:** "Dude you are a baller. I appreciated your attention to the small details of the project - especially the final front end styling - that I think took our project from solid to awesome. I also respect the confidence you have in your abilities. It is inspiring to watch you throw commands at your terminal, confident that you can figure out what to do if the unexpected happens.

I do think you need to watch out that you don't get overconfident, or let your attention to detail make you lose sight of the bigger goals. I think it might have been overconfidence that led to that messed up view getting pushed to master, because I know that if you had looked at the page before submitting the PR you never would have let it get pushed up. And similarly, I think your zeal for clean code meant that you pulled out the mapping from the homes index view without realizing that we needed to pass it some data, and that's what messed up the push to heroku. I definitely accept responsibility for both of these as well because I think I merged it and didn't look or didn't catch either of them before they got to master.

Overall though, all's well that ends well and this project was my favorite one at Turing. I think that's in large part because I got to work with someone who was supremely capable and confident, and would produce good code that would fit in with the rest of the work being done. It led to some beautiful results that I'm proud to have been a part of. It seemed like you were constantly working to make our project better - in the really visible ways like the georgeous styling, but also in the invisible ways, like those dozens of controller tests. It was a privilege to work with you, and if you were being serious about working on gametime together then definitely count me in."

#### Feedback about me

**From Ben Pepper, 1605 student:** "Ashwin has been one of my saving graces in my first 6 weeks at Turing.  He started out as one of Micro Posse 6â€™s mentors and we paired several times outside of that.  He has immense patience and was able and willing to take more time to explain concepts to me to the point where i felt comfortable moving forward.  Ashwin knows his stuff and has a great attitude when it comes to Turing and the work load.  He is always willing to send along more info that he thinks will be beneficial (and it is).  He also always followed up with me after we met to see how things were going.  Ashwin is an amazing person to have at Turing and I have no doubt that he will continue to be a valuable member of the turing community."

**From Josh Washke, Pivot teammate:** "Ashwin: I had a great time working with you. I felt like your organization really pushed the project forward and was key to getting a lot done. With a lot of projects I have spent time unsure of what we were doing as a group or what I was supposed to be doing. But you did a great job keeping us all on track and always focusing on small obtainable goals.
    You also were able to deliver several key features on your own. A good example is the JQuery functionality, it was obviously a difficult feature but you stuck with it and delivered it when you said you would.
    You seem very focused on following a TDD approach, which I appreciate. The best advice I can give you is when TDDing remember to drop down to non feature tests during implementation. Controller tests haven't been as much of a focus but using model tests to drive your model methods and poro tests to drive your poro methods is still a good idea.
    Overall though I had a great time working with you and I think our projects reflects how well we worked together as a group. I would be happy to work with you again."
	
**From Patrick Hardy, Pivot teammate:** "I think the skill that shined through the most in this project was your organization and diligence. You played a key role in keeping track of the group's goals and progress, so that I always felt like I was being very productive whether we were working in a group or independently. This played a big part in allowing us to implement so many "extension" features, and these are what make me especially proud of this project. I hope you we're able to meet your goal of enjoying or not stressing too much about this project. Also, I like that you said you were excited about being pushed by our group coding sessions. I encourage you to seek out side-projects or future teams that will continue to push you. This seems to be the best asset for learning that we have here, and you are a strong programmer so it may take a little extra effort. (which is a good thing!)"

## Community

* led Hamilton posse

I didn't have a great experience with this posse. There wasn't much interest or commitment from the group, so it often felt like either I had to do everything or nothing would get done. This isn't in itself a problem, but our focus was React Native - a framework I didn't and don't really understand at all. As a result, besides working through a React Native tutorial and becoming slightly more familiar with the xcode developer suite of tools, I didn't achieve much.

However, I did learn a lot about how to lead and organize a posse effectively. As a result, I think the clojure posse I'm starting next mod will be much more effective.
