Drew Thompson - M1 Portfolio

##Individual

###Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to be able to easily create my own programs from scratch.  Through the work on projects and classes I feel very confident in my ability to do so now.

###End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Nate


Challenge: Option 3
​
####Notes:
​* The war continues between `@instance_vars` and `attr_accessor`	
​* Plan and psuedo code more. You're holding too much in your head

Scores:

1 Ruby Syntax & API: 3

2 Completion and Progress: 3

3 Testing: 4

4 Workflow: 3

5 Collaboration: 3

6 Enumerable & Collections: 3

#Work

I did the following solo projects during this module:

##Mastermind

[github repo](https://github.com/drew-t/mastermind)

[project markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

###Assessed By: Tess

Notes: 

* Consider breaking out gameplay into a separate class.
* Nice to see messages extracted into a separate class.

Scores:

1 Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

2 Enumerable & Collections: 3

3 REPL Interface and Game Functionality: 4
    
4 Breaking Logic into Components: 3

##Binary Search Tree

[github repo](https://github.com/drew-t/binary-search-tree)

[project markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown)

###Assessed By: Nate Allen

#####Notes:

Write your tests with more edge cases and failing cases

Scores:

1 Functional Expectations: 3.5

2 Test-Driven Development: 4

3 Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 4

4 Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

5 Looping or Recursion: 4


##Sorting Suite
###Assessed By: Horace

[Github Repo](https://github.com/drew-t/sorting_suite)

[Project Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

Notes:

  *Testing is solid at a baseline; for the next level would be interesting to look at some more automated "fuzz" / "mutation" tests

  *Also would be interesting to look at extracting the standard high-level "acceptance" sorting tests into a module of some sort since they are the same across the 3

  *These ideas might give some interesting insights into what is more general about the behavior / interface and what is specific to the algorithm in question

  *Implementaitons are clean and pretty easy to follow

  *Doing ok with pulling out helper methods (swap, merge, etc)

  *Only quibble is with the insertion sort implementation -- our approach of repeatedly swapping to get an element to where it needs to be starts to blend the paradigms

Scores:

1 Functional Expectations: 3

2 Testing: 4

3 Ruby Style: 3

4 Organization: 4

##Complete Me
###Assessed By: Horace   
[Github Repo](https://github.com/drew-t/complete_me)
[ReadMe](https://github.com/drew-t/complete_me)

Notes:

   *Got that simple cov
   good number of tests at first glance

   *Suggestion and Selection features all work well

   *Code loads the large dictionary fairly quickly
   added substring-specific selection feature

   *Good use of skinny CompleteMe class to provide exact interface into the required methods from spec

   *Clean implementation of the algorithm; follows the conceptual core pretty closely

   *A few spots where we could consolidate logic between similar branches of code

   *Play around more with using enums like map to build up a collection rather than iteratively appending to one

   *Tests look straightforward and solid

Scores:

1 Functional Expectations: 3

2 Test-Driven Development: 3

3 Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3

4 Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

5 Enumerable & Collectionn: 3

###Team
Projects

I found the team projects to be pretty enjoyable.  A good mix of a challenge and it was really nice to work with other people and learn from them.  Having two different perspectives definitely makes it a lot easier to come up with solutions.


##HTTP Yeah You Know Me

[Github Repo](https://github.com/drew-t/httpyykm)

[Project Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

###Evaluator: Andrew

Notes:

*Some poorly named variables

*Opportunities to refactor long methods. Really long case statement

*Some leakage of components. Decent split of responsibilities.

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1 Overall Functionality: 4

2 Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

3 Test-Driven Development: 3

4 Breaking Logic into Components: 3


##Black Thursday

####Feedback to Me

From working with Jonathan Liss on HTTP YYKM I got this feedback:  

I liked working with Drew because he's very methodical and quick to come up with solutions to the problems we meet.  We did very well as a team since he is able to independently work on portions of the project as well as collaborate on one thing.  If Drew were to improve on one thing I would say it should be test driven development.  Think about the end result and then dive into the problem.  I appreciated working with Drew because we were able to get a lot done by dividing up the project into sections and working independently when we needed to.

From Ling Tran on the Black Thursday project:

####Community
#####Giving Feedback

The Turing community has been great.  Many of the upper module students have been very welcoming and willing to help at any time.

#####Being a Community Member
*Community Feedback*

From Jonathan Bernesser:

Drew and I paired while we were on separate projects (hyde vs http). Drew was very easy to work with and was able to patiently explain his code to me. I found that his eagerness to explain as well as his overall positivity made this a very a positive experience. As a classmate and a Brooks posse member, we had spent a lot of time together and throughout all of it he was able to demonstrate an eagerness to learn and respect for other ideas.

#####Playing a Part

One of the things that I've done in the community was work some other students on making a chat application in GO language.  Since then I have collaborated with them on future needs of the program and worked on a couple features.  It has been a lot of fun.
