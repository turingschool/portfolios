Team: Mark Miranda & Ling Tran

Assessed By: Andrew Carmer

##### Notes:

* Testing:
  - Number of tests decent
  - Consider scope of data needed for test - as little data as possible
  - If data is being reused outside of a test, then create a test helper method to generate that data
  - Consider name of tests as related to what is being tested (ex., model vs. controller)
  - Uniqueness and validation tests - set up both valid and invalid data in test; be mindful of difference between #valid? and #save
  - Preferred Minitest syntax: assert(object).respond_to?(:table), rather than assert_equal object, :table
  - Would have liked to see more scoping in feature tests
* Tip for DTR coverage:
  - Talk about style guide (hash syntax, how to express methods, number of lines, structure of tests, etc.)
* Other areas for refactoring:
  - Consider edge case for missing URL
  - Validator object in Server
  - Separate methods for #get_data and #format_data
  - Consider scope of responsiveness

## Community

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:


### Giving Feedback

>**Deborah Hamel:** Deb was great to pair with on the Rails MiniProject.  She stepped outside of her comfort zone to accommodate me by allowing us to do most of the project remotely via ScreenHero.  It was a little difficult at times but she dealt with it gracefully.  She was engaged every step of the way which helped me to keep focus.  She also kept a great attitude throughout and made it a very fun and enjoyable project to do.  She took the initiative to style our project during times when we weren’t both working on it.  I reaallllllyyyy appreciated that.  Overall Deb was great to work with and willing to go out of her way to help in any way.

>**Mark Miranda:** Mark was very helpful throughout the project.  He was instrumental in styling our site as well.  He was constantly working alongside Ling and myself providing input to whatever we were working on at the time.  He paired very well and let everyone suggest ideas and provided useful and positive feedback regularly.

>**Jon Liss:**  This is the 2nd project I’ve worked on with Jon.  It has been a much different and much better experience.  Not that the first was that bad, but we definitely fell into roles more comfortably this time.  It was very easy to communicate with him about the direction of our project and he was eager to take up things that others might not (styling).  He was quick to help with any logic where needed and really took to the different mindset behind styling the site.  I knew he could do the rails logic so it was interesting to see him struggle at times trying to figure out Materialize.  Overall working with Jon was a great experience.

### Feedback Received

>"Pairing with Drew again was great.  He’s proven himself to be a very, very strong programmer and I’m always happy to take an opportunity to learn from what he does.  Drew was invaluable to our team, and brought a very focused mindset to our sometimes rambling discussions. Not only is Drew a strong programmer, but he’s a very fun guy and great to get along with (if you went to Perdue though, all bets are off).  If i were to offer some criticism, it wouldn’t really be criticism at all: I want to see a gnarly side project. You can’t hide the fact that you’re a talented programmer, so go do something cool!  As always it was a great experience working with Drew and I look forward to doing the same in Mod 3."-**Jon Liss**

>"Charmander has great leadership abilities and helped keep us focused the milestones we needed to hit. He has a great grasp on the concepts as we learn them and the ability to implement them. He also made sure we understood the concepts and the overall picture as well as importance of what we were doing and spending our time. I hope to be paired with Charmander on a project in the future."-**Mark Miranda**

>"This will be my second time partnering with Charmander on a project. He is a steady partner with a rich inner life. I learned to be braver in exploring options and refactoring in the problem-solving process from him. He was markedly proactive with writing tests, which was something he had been working on since working together on Black Thursday in module 1. The only area for improvement I can identify for Charmander is that sometimes he can get caught up in his thought process and not communicate it immediately with his project partner. This is something I'm flexible with but it might be misleading for a more sensitive project partner. It'll be hilarious if I get paired with Charmander again."-**Ling Tran**

>"Working with Drew has been a great experience. His approach to programming is very unique and after pairing with him for only a few hours. Its clear to see why he is such a great programmer. I really enjoy his out of box thinking to to get things working when we would get stuck.  His strengths by far, is the logic, style, and commitment to not only learning but making sure that others around him are just as knowledgable. As we would get off track with the features that we wanted to implement for our animal shelter website, Drew always kept us back on track reminding us that this project isn’t a design about what we know we should do but on what the instructors want us to do (this was extremely helpful). I know Drew is not a fan of styling not cause he doesn’t know how to but because it doesn’t interest him so my only constructive feedback to Drew is that he need to work more on styling"-**Ali Andersen**


### Playing a Part

Posse was definitely a different experience this module.  I don't know whether I'd say it was better or worse.  I was in Golick posse.  I think Allan and Sal had some good ideas for what they wanted it to be, but was hard to keep it structured constantly.  I think it is difficult for students to try to regularly prepare something for other people with slightly different interests always in check.  All-in-all I think it was fun and they put together some nifty projects.  I know way more about curling than I otherwise would have.  I think this experience helped me professionally by forcing me to derive all of the learning from the web.  There was no other available resource.  This will definitely come in handy in the future trying to learn new technologies that I may not have an easy connection to for a reference.

I worked with Jared on a student-led elective this module.  We built upon previous iterations of the "Workflow/Environment Setup" electives.  We took input from fellow students on the best Atom packages, Bash shortcuts, and other workflow helping applications and demonstrated them to Module 1 students.  We also then helped them to set up those tools on their machines.  It was pretty interesting and I definitely learned a few shortcuts that I didn't know before.

This module I wanted to try and reach out more to other students.  I think that I succeeded.  I know that I spend more time helping people within my module in various aspects of projects.  I also spent time in the morning helping one of the Mod1 students.  It tended to be more life-at-turing help than formal pairing, but I think it probably helped him deal with it a little better.

I know there are going to be more opportunities where I can help other students in the future and I want to make a stronger effort to do so.
