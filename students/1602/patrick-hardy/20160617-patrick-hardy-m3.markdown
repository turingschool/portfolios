### Self-Evaluation Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3 (pending revisions)
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Community Participation**: 3
* **E: Peer & Instructor Feedback**: 3

## Individual Assessment
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/patrickwhardy/module_3_assessment)

* Notes:
- Don't need responders gem, and don't need to install it.
- Didn't change authenticity to `null_session`
- I don't think you tested in Postman or Curl, because if you had, your POST would not have worked
- Good use of Strong params
- TDD? One feature test was clearly written after code was functional.
- Sometimes using string interpolation in ERB where it really isn't necessary, and makes it inconsistent and harder to read
- Why pass store data via params instead of getting from API along with the hours?
- Using hashes in the view
- Refactoring your views would bring your Rails Syntax score up, and we'd like to see you do that
- All user stories are done
- Great test coverage and value

## Evaluation Criteria
​
Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:
​
### 1. Ruby Style
​
* 4: Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored
* **3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components**
* 2: Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components
* 1: Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity
* 0: Developer writes code that is difficult to understand
​
### 2. Rails Syntax & API
​
* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Feedback: Self-Solicited
### Feedback For You
* "Patrick: I had a great time working with you on the Pivot. Your a strong programmer who is able to get stuff done. You seemed capable in all aspects of the projects from the database level stuff to the javascript we haven't even learned yet. And your a very chill group member who ranks among the easiest to get along with of all the people I've worked with, Ultimately its hard to ask for more than that in a group project.
* Constructively I would say keep working on your styling skills. Specifically just applying a final layer of polish to your views. I think with styling, its the little details, in how things line up and the margins that really set sites apart.
* Overall though I had a great time working with you and I think our projects reflects how well we worked together as a group. I would be happy to work with you again." - Josh Washke
* "One of my favorite things about this project was to see how we've both changed and grown. I think one of the things I said to you from Rush Hour was that there were some things in your setup and naming conventions that were a little hard to follow when you were driving. This time I didn't have any issues with watching you drive so that was a cool change to see. Also as usual I enjoyed your easy-going attitude to the work - it makes it very easy for the team to stay relaxed when you are there.
* I think the place I saw for improvement was with how you handled the front end stuff. It's possible we didn't do a good enough job determining what it would mean that you would do the styling, and that led to a little confusion down the road. I guess I thought that meant you were interested in producing something really polished, instead of functional. So it was difficult to watch the days go by and not see some things get fixed with the views, like the formatting of the images. I think if we did it again I guess I'd suggest being more explicit in what you think is the level of work you'd want to put into the front end stuff if that's something you volunteer or are asked to handle. And I can definitely do better in offering to do the work myself or at least being more clear in what I'd want to see.
* Overall though I really enjoyed working with you as before. Some of the most fun things we did splitting up and watching it all come together at the end. The way you delivered the mapping feature overnight and the initial implementation of the calendar were strong examples of that, especially given all the tests that had to get rewritten as a result of that. And I think it is a testimony to your initial implementation of the calendar that I didn't run into any stupid bugs or problems with testing when I went back for the graying out function, and Patrick was also able to get the search up and running. Great job, especially fighting through the flu at the end!" - Ashwin Rao
### Your Feedback To Peers:
* Josh Washke:    I was super impressed with your coding skills. You are able to hold a lot of moving parts in your head at once and are very fast to come up with solutions to complicated problems. Also, your knowledge of ancillary skills such as working with AWS, controller tests etc were very helpful and demonstrate the time and energy you apply to programming. Sometimes, throughout the project, I wondered whether you were being challenged enough. Although I know you had several late nights diving deep into a feature, I wonder if there are more ways that you can continue to push your skills, as the Turing curriculum might be straightforward for you. Also, I am so happy about your attitude towards your work; "I'm doing rails stuff all weekend anyway so I'll take on anything" - is awesome! It's very cool that you can work on this stuff all the time without much stress and are happy for more challenges.
* Ashwin Rao: I think the skill that shined through the most in this project was your organization and diligence. You played a key roll in keeping track of the group's goals and progress, so that I always felt like I was being very productive whether we were working in a group or independently. This played a big part in allowing us to implement so many "extension" features, and these are what make me especially proud of this project. I hope you we're able to meet your goal of enjoying or not stressing too much about this project. Also, I like that you said you were excited about being pushed by our group coding sessions. I encourage you to seek out side-projects or future teams that will continue to push you. This seems to be the best asset for learning that we have here, and you are a strong programmer so it may take a little extra effort. (which is a good thing!)

## Something valuable you've taken away from your posse.
I'n my posse I have been able learn more about what opportunities are available in Civic Tech. I have learned about Federal sub-contracting practices and internal software development. I also got to practice using mapbox and learn about rendering polyshapes with this service.
