* Satisfactory Progress

Read links should be stylistically differentiated from unread links. You could gray them out or use a strike through.

3: Developer completes iterations 1 through 5 with few bugs and no missing functionality. (In the real final assessment, this will involve completing one supporting feature.)
* Ruby Syntax & Style

4: Developer is able to write Ruby demonstrating a broad/deep understanding of available language features. Application demonstrates great understanding of Object-Oriented modeling. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* Rails Style & API

4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* Javascript Syntax & Style

3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* Testing

For next time: if selenium isn't working, at minimum get controller testing and at maximum, js unit tests

3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.
* User Interface

4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Chad Ellison - I had a really great time working with Chad on Asteroids. I was amazed at how effortlessly Chad was able to motivate and invest days on end into the project. Despite his diligence late night coding binges, I never felt pressured to do the same. It really seemed like we both just really enjoyed working on the project, so there was never any stress or tension over working on it. I may recommend that Chad try to break goals into smaller executable pieces - e.g. when trying to integrate a multiplayer, I feel like we took on a huge task without understanding the scope of this feature. This was definitely one of my favorite projects of Turing, much because Chad was so enjoyable to work with.

### Feedback from others

From Chad - Working on Asteroids with Patrick was a great experience. Patrickâ€™s clear communication skills and passion made pairing with him very enjoyable and productive. We were able to discuss features and solutions very openly and easily. His skills stood out through his ability to understand a problem and implement a solution quickly. For example, we had to relearn trigonometry to draw and accelerate our ship. Patrick found the correct trig equation to properly draw the ship in less than half an hour.
