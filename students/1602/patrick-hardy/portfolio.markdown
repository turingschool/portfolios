## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming in to turing I had very little experience with Object Oriented languages.
I have made sure to carve out at least five hours (much more in the first three weeks)
every week to practice exercisms, enums exercises, work with mentors and read "Eloquent Ruby" in order ensure I have a solid grasp on OOD. Building "Black Thursday" was a great
victory that let me know I had mastery of object manipulation.

### Mid Module Assessment
### Assessed by Nate
* Collaboration: 4
* Ruby Syntax: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Blocks and Enumerations: 3
* Testing: 3
* Workflow: 2

Given this feedback I made a concerted effort to work on projects with just keyboard
shortcuts, and continued do focused exercises on enumerables and building simple programs.

### Attendance

I have had perfect attendance this module. I have arrived before posse challenge,
left after wrap up, and been on time for every class every day this module.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

### Mythical Creatures
Although this is in the project section, it was never evaluated.
I have re-done this project several times, as I really liked how it reinforced
OOD and enumerable concepts.

* assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-exercises/tree/master/mythical-creatures
* git_repository: https://github.com/patrickwhardy/mythical-creatures.git

### Linked List/Jungle Beats
* eval: https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1602/jungle_beat/patrick_hardy.markdown
* assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown
* git_repository: https://github.com/patrickwhardy/jungle-beats.git

In this project I got a lot of practice with the object oriented model.
I gained a solid understanding of hashes and recursion. I was not
very familiar with writing tests and did not know many debugging techniques at
this time which prevented me from debugging my methods in the time allotted.

### Enigma
* eval:

* assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown
* git_repository: https://github.com/patrickwhardy/enigma.git

While completing this project, I was finally able to systematically debug errors
and test functionality. I also learned a lot about breaking responsibilities
into classes and building file structures that represent this conceptual structure.
I was very happy to recieve such positive feedback from Meeka

## Team
### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

## Hyde
* eval: https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1602/hyde/jennifer-soden_patrick-hardy.md
* assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown
* git_repository: https://github.com/patrickwhardy/hyde.git

Hyde greatly reinforced my file I/O skills and introduced me to API's
and some interesting gems. It was a nice experience learn how to work
in a pair, use github, divide project tasks and integrate this work into
one program. I was proud to have tackled many of the conceptually
difficult tasks on this project, but I also was unaware of several
syntax best-practices.

## Black Thursday

* eval: https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1602/black_thursday/kiesenhofer_hardy.markdown
* assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown
* git_repository: https://github.com/Claudia108/black_thursday.git

Black Thursday my favorite and most complicated project of the module. Because my
partner and I did every step of this project together, it provided a ton of practice
with ruby. The initial setup of this project was conceptually difficult, and required
us to come up with the resourceful solution of passing self through the initialize of
repositories and low-level objects. The latter half of the project provided extensive
practice with enumerables and hashes. Ultimately, I was very happy with the design
decisions we made and our spec harness runs very fast because of this. We were also
able to spend signicant time refactoring and I am very proud of how clean and
elegant our code has become.

## Community

A major goal of mine in Module 1, has been to get to know students across
all modules. I have made a concerted effort to share meals with students in
other modules, I organized a climbing day with Horace and Penny, and reached
out to and met three different Turing alums outside of school.

I attended an elective and meeting regarding Go Code Colorado, and have
worked on app ideas for this challenge with students across other modules.

On March 4, I facilitated a gear up on environmental responsibility.

### Posse Challenge
I participated in posse challenge every day this module. I troubleshoot project
problems with my posse members and presented out work one week.

# Portfolio Rubric

Your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment


## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.


* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.


* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.


* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.

OUTCOME: PROMOTED
