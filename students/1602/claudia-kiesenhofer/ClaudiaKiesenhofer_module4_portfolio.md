### Areas of Emphasis

My goal for module 4 was to soak up and learn as much Javascript as possible and understand how the front end and back end can effectively work together in bigger more dynamic apps. I also wanted to keep working on a React Native App on the side to learn more about the IOS/Android world. I am very happy with the outcome of this module. I feel I gained enough to fulfill my first goal. I did not manage to touch on the second goal but I will tackle that as soon as school is done.

### Work

IdeaBox initially scared me but after getting into it I really enjoyed working on it. Similar experience with GameTime. After the hard pieces were figured out I had so much fun working on it. I did a bunch of testing, and really enjoyed it. My highlight is still TexArch. I chose it for the scale up project and loved it even more than in module 3. I am excited to get done with school so I can put more time and effort in this app. It is the perfect playground to apply any new concepts and practice my skills in a real world context.

TexArch is an application specifically built for Sergio Ayala, archaeologist at Gault School of Archaelogical Research in San Marcos, Texas. The website allows visitors to learn about his research project focussing on a specific period in Texas history.
I added the following features to the existing project: fixed the request.referrer error for oauth login, updated map api, updated sites table, added video table and include iframe to play videos, created first react components and added testing coverage.

## Team

### Projects

This was the only group project of module 4. I always enjoy group projects. With this project I realized how much practice we gained working in groups and on our own. We could switch between pairing and working alone and got very efficient at it towards the end of the project. I am happy with the result of these intense 2 weeks.

#### Game Time - Puzzlenary

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Claudia108/puzzlenary)

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

Trolly Poozleh/puzzlenary is a game combining whack-a-mole with puzzles. A player uncovers an image by clicking on tiles when they flash green. If the player clicks a red tile he/she looses a life. The game is won when the picture if fully uncovered. The game is lost when all three lives are lost. The game has five levels with increasing difficulty. Each level the number of tiles and the number of "bad" colors increases.

##### Feedback to me:
Working twice with Claudia is a great honor, to see her level of skills increase to a new level is great! The best thing about  working with Claudia, is her determination, JavaScript was a new language for all of us on Game Time. Claudia made sure that we understood the importance of testing and was determined that our project have solid code. Now that we are at the end of our school, I am super happy to know that Claudia will end up being a fantastic programmer and have a great career where I hope that one day in the future we can code again. Claudia you are determined, passionate and amazingly skilled when it comes to producing great code. You truly are a software engineer  and I wish you the best! I know you will be very successful in this career field and am super glad I got to do my last group project with you.  (Alireza Andersen)

I have had the pleasure of working with Claudia on two projects. The first was by random assignment and the second because I was blessed with her choosing to work with me and I was so excited. I was excited both because she is such an incredible person to be around, and because coding with her is such an enjoyable and rewarding process.  Two of my best group project experiences have been alongside Claudia, both of them were times where I felt like I learned the most and had the most inclusive team dynamic.  Claudia is meticulous and relentless in her process of TDD and her code quality is pristine. I love to experience the joy she feels from solving complex problems and getting successful testing runs. It’s infectious. She’s very self aware and is constantly learning and growing. She sees the bigger picture and is very positive and compassionate. She’s been the voice of reason and empathy for me when things have been hard. She’s a very dear friend and a wonderful human being. I look forward to seeing what she does with her skills and I know she would be an asset to any team.  (Kris Foss)

## Community

### Giving Feedback
Kris is a good listener to every teammates ideas and concerns.  She has a strong sense of what the group needs at a given situation to be the most productive and knows how to effectively and respectfully communicate it - to keep discussing unclear points, to join efforts or work individually and compare possible solutions after a defined time. This makes her extremely valuable as a team lead. At the same time she is very skilled at experimenting different solutions on her own until she finds the best way to solve a given problem. But she is open to hear other’s ideas and opinions and adjust her way if the group decides for a different solution. She is able to clearly state her preferences and explain the reasoning for it. Moving forward I wish Kris will me more aware and confident about her coding and soft skills. She will add a lot of quality and skill combined with caring and warmth to any team she joins. I would love to work with her again.

Ali is a passionate programmer who puts in the time and effort needed to accomplish his goals. He will tackle anything and find a creative way to figure it out even if he has never done anything like it. I appreciate his caring attitude and his excitement celebrating little accomplishments throughout the creation process. He is open to other people’s ideas and solutions and tries to understand where they are coming from. I enjoyed seeing how we both improved our ability to listen better to each others ideas and how we naturally found our roles in the team and focussed on our strength. I enjoyed creating this fun game together.  Ali will be a great asset to any creative team!

### Being a Community Member

### Playing a Part
My part in the community during school was mostly informal. I realized that I wasn't as much "out there" because I didn't have much surplus for it. I am usually a very social person, but with the workload at school I became more quiet - just trying to survive/get through the assignments. I wish to stay connected and give back more as soon as I have more surplus again.
