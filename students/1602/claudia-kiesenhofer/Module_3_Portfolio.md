# Claudia Kiesenhofer - (M3) Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Practise using ruby and rails, learn everything needed to get ready for the job. Get more confident about my skill level through personal projects rather than working in groups. Set up weekly mentor sessions with more than one person. Keep practising Ruby. Get experience with Javascript and React Native. Get a better sense of the industry and community by attending meetups and meeting new people.

### Work

I really enjoyed working on all of the assigned personal projects this module. My highlight is TexArch because it solves a real problem and need. I am really satisfied with outcome of the 2 weeks of work but am excited to keep working on this app to grow it over time. It will be a perfect playground to apply any new concepts I am learning and give me the opportunity to practise my skills in a real world context.

#### TexArch - Selfdirected Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Claudia108/TexArch)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

TexArch is an application specifically built for Sergio Ayala, archaeologist at Gault School of Archaelogical Research in San Marcos, Texas. The website allows visitors to learn about his research project focussing on a specific period in Texas history. After logging in via Google OAuth users can view all artifact images for specific artifact types, view specific artifact images and data, locate artifact sites on a dynamic google map and see all artifacts found at that site. The admin can create and update sites and artifacts and upload images. Can also view all users of his site.

Comments from Josh:
* Solid project, clean code, very good testing.
* The project demonstrates solid understanding of MVC concepts.
* The project didn't require very high level problem solving. Recommend to keep practising working with apis.

In this project, I focussed on consuming and working with data from public APIs.
As a vehicle for learning these concepts, I selected the API from github and worked to re-construct a simplified version of the website's existing UI using their own API. 
As I built these features, I also worked with the OAuth protocol to authenticate the users with the third-party provider, and used various testing techniques to allow testing against the third-party data.
This project was not graded.


## Team

### Projects

This module I was only assigned one group project in a team of 4 people. In contrast to any other team I worked in throughout Turing the group dynamic for this project turned out to be challenging throughout the 2 weeks of working together. It was hard to get to a common ground on design questions and how to execute the project goals in code. The evaluation scores reflect well where the biggest challenges were.

#### Zeba - The Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alirezaandersen/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

Ziba is a job search site that allows users to apply for open positions or favorite and save favorited positions to apply later. It allows company access to create open positions and manage them. 

##### Evaluation Notes from Nate:

##### Feedback to me:
Claudia, working with you a second time under a different group dynamic was very rewarding. Implementing the favoriting feature was hairy but you managed to execute with great test coverage and understandable code. It was great to see you gain confidence in trusting your own abilities to build something and debug. One thing that may be helpful for your debugging process is to simply dive in and investigate the problem according to given feedback, rather than theorizing about the issue. I think this was a habit at the start of the project and understandably since it was a tricky feature to make happen, but I saw tremendous growth in your willingness to just dive in and pry around. I am also impressed with your compassion and ability to navigate a tough group dynamic. I hope to be as resilient as you are. - Ling Tran


Working with you throughout The Pivot was full of many highs and lows. You did a very good job in figuring out how to get the Favorite's functionality to work with our project and in making sure to communicate with Ali when necessary. Something that I'd love for you to work on is to try and keep your stress levels low even when experiencing something like the pivot in the future. For example, I noticed that when something bad will happen (merge conflicts, css not loading on heroku, etc.) you'd get very stressed out and anxious in moments where it won't help the team figure out the solution. I'd like for you to also remember to take your breaks when you find yourself in stressful moments by taking a walk outside or something that'll help out clear the mind from the bad vibes. Thanks for being an amazing team member. - Alex N


Claudia, working with you has been a pleasure. You are very detailed and TDD driven which was a huge help. I appreciated how you would always see how everyone else is doing. As for constructive feedback,  I think you passion for understanding also became a frustration for the lack of understanding. I too have this as a area of improvement I need to work on as well. But a wise person told me once. You can't learn how to change the world overnight, it takes time. I am very confident that you skills will sky rocket in the near future and you will dominate this industry. - Ali

### Giving Feedback

Ling:   Ling, your way of tackling bugs and using all the tools we have learned has taught me a lot during these last 2 projects. You are very confident and open to try out new things (like presenters and services) and efficiently find the resources to implement them in the appropriate way. This encouraged me to also try out new things on my own. I was insecure about my skills and asked you for help and feedback a lot last weekend. When you just gave me some hints and put things back into my hands I was disappointed. Looking back I have to thank you for that because I had to figure out things on my own and this taught me a lot. I feel so much more confident after the pivot, partly because of that. I wish you stepped up a bit more when we were trying to find consensus on decisions because you have such a good grasp on good programming strategies. You have a lot to say and to give to projects that way. Also, I enjoy working with you because of your positive spirit and your caring personality and your commitment to good work.
 
 
Alex:   This was a hard project and I am happy with what we turned in given the difficulties we dealt with. I know that you were very upset with the code quality the evening before the due date. I understand the pressure you felt and I am impressed that you could sacrifice the good grade on code and put all effort in everything else that had to happen in order to ship a functioning product. I appreciate that you were open to fill in whatever was needed. I know you didn't enjoy working with materialize but you did it anyway and you did such a great job styling our site. I really enjoyed debugging with you. Your calm and analytical way of tackling a problem created such a great space for understanding and figuring out where the issue was. It taught me a lot. You know so much and I wish you would have shared that a bit more even though it wasn't easy to get heard. I wish you could keep a positive spirit a bit more when things get difficult. You have so many coding skills, knowledge and great ideas to share but when you get in the mode of "everything will go bad" a lot of your ability is unused. I am glad you could switch out of this mode quickly, especially the last evening of the pivot. Your commitment to a high quality project outcome and your caring and supportive attitude is very inspiring and makes working with you really enjoyable.


Ali:    I learned a lot of new things throughout this project mainly because our group dynamic was not easy. We all had our part in it in the way we worked with the tension. I appreciate how committed you are to what you do - in this case our project. You brought a lot of ideas to the table from your work experience which enhanced the  quality of our UX and gave us interesting aspects and problems to solve (i.e. finding a way to set up a new company account and a store admin in one process). I very much appreciate how much you care about the people around you and I am happy we got to know each other better. In discussions about how to do things I wish you were a bit more open to hear others' ideas and inputs and think them through before you come to a conclusion. I know this tendency from myself. That is probably why we butted heads quite a bit. But for me it was just about the project and my way of trying to understand what makes most sense. Also, I think it would have helped everyone if we communicated more how to implement features throughout the project (especially during the weekend) so everyone could be on board with each others strategies and help each other out. You did so much work on this project but I didn't really know throughout how you were doing things. We could have probably saved a lot of time we spent on debugging if we knew more and could give some input in each others work. We got so exhausted because of the amount of work but I am happy we kept the style and could turn in this good of a product in the end.

### Being a Community Member

### Playing a Part

I was part of the Hamilton Polka and tried to spend as much time as possible with our very small team. Still, I don't feel like we acchieved what I was hoping for at the beginning of the module. It is hard to learn a completely new language on the side when noone in the group has a foundation of understanding.
I haven't taken any official role in supporting the community but tried to be available for help and support whenever needed.
