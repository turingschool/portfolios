# Jeneve Parrish - M1 Portfolio


## Areas of Emphasis

This module, my first priority was to learn what I *don’t* know. Now, that list is enormous and still growing; I didn't expect that I would also learn *how* to find answers as needed. That knowledge became more valuable in a discipline where needs, practices and tools aren't determinate and change rapidly. My second goal was to establish a work schedule that was both productive and realistic. While I *have* been more productive than I could have imagined, I know that the pace I am currently maintaining can't be sustained for long. Thankfully, the program at Turing *isn't* long, and I know that my family and I will become more and more accustomed to my schedule as time goes on. I will leave Turing with a new definition of rigor, and in the next 3 modules, continuing to improve my typing and workflow efficiency will be areas of focus.

## Individual Projects

### Jungle Beats

Jungle Beats is a simple program that will play back sounds provided by the user in a ridiculous computer voice. The program uses a simple linked-list data structure to store, and when prompted, play the sounds in order. Users can add sounds to the list in several ways and adjust the pitch of the voice that plays them back.

 * [Evaluation Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1602/jungle_beat/jeneve_parrish.markdown)

#### Evaluation Comments

* Assessment will be completed by 11pm tonight. It's important to make sure your application matches the spec requirements and not change the way it's called by changing the class name (even if it's clearer!)
* Application is missing more than one because expectation
* Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
* Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
* Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

### Nightwriter

Nightwriter is a program that reads regular text from and translates it into a fascimile of braille wherein "0" represents a bump, and "." represents a space. It's sibling, Nightreader, reads and translates that facsimile of braille and returns regular text. I struggled with the project but produced a working program and was able to see how the project could be improved, expanded, and used in real-world applications. For instance, the program could be modified to provide input for a 3D printer.

 * [Evaluation Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1602/night_writer/jeneve_parrish.md)

#### Evaluation Comments
* Application successfully decodes to and from braille.
* four tests.
* Code worked, though it does not account for some edge cases, and is somewhat brittle.
* Some opportunities for refactoring, methods were overly long.

## Team Projects
### Hyde

Hyde is a lightweight application for blogging that provides a file structure and templates for users to make posts and pages in easy-to-read markdown language. Users can run a 'build' from the command line that will translate all of their files to HTML. The program's 'post' command will generate a new post template; the watch command will record changes while the user works, prompting them to 'build' after a specified amount of time. This was my first paired project; both our program and our partnership were a success.

 * [Evaluation Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1602/hyde/%20Jared-Roth&Jeneve-Parrish.md)

#### Evaluation comments
 * Had conversations about refactoring and opportunities to make code
   cleaner and generally more readable.
 * A small bug with going tot he root, but nothing to concerning.
 * Able to talk about all the code and it was knowledgable
 * Didn't use many enumerables but there were not many opportunities.
 * Testing was good. Could have have some more edge cases particularly in taking in the args.

### Black Thursday

Black Thursday is back-end program for accessing and analyzing sales data. It's possible application's include managing and accounting for e-commerce.

 * [Evaluation Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1602/black_thursday/miranda_parrish.markdown)

#### Evaluation comments
 * 118 runs, 131 asertions, runs in 40s.
 * 99 percent test coverage, test suite uses partial fixtures.
 * Lower order classes have some extraneous getter methods.
 * In Sales Analyst, some of the methods are overly long, some of the math  I'd like to have seen pulled out into another object like a helper class or module or something.

## Teamwork
Pairing was the highlight of Module 1. I worked with [Jared Roth](https://github.com/JaredRoth) on [Hyde](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown) and [Mark Miranda](https://github.com/notmarkmiranda) on [Black Thursday](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown). Documentation from both projects follows:

## Feedback

#### From Instructors

 - From Mike
	 - I need to keep working on ruby exercises throughout the break and module 2 or I'll be in trouble in Module 3. Especially Hashes.
	 - I need to improve my typing.
	 - My reasoning and problem-solving is good, and I am able to incorporate feedback and collaborate on the fly.
 - From Horace
	 - Overall pretty smooth
	 - Little confusion between receiver and argument
	 - Testing workflow is coming along pretty well
	 - Doing well iterating with each; would like to see a little more diversity in the enums -- this is a good focus for the next 3 weeks
	 - [complete mid-module assessment](https://github.com/jeneve/1module_portfolio/blob/master/1module_mid_module_assesment.rb)

#### From a Mentor


 - From Mary Cutrali
	 - I am excited to see Jeneve make continuous progress throughout the
	   program. I believe if she continues to pair, focuses on ruby
	   fundamentals, and applies herself consistently (as she does now) she
	   will continue to grow into a fantastic software engineer.

#### From peers

 - (from Ashwin) Overall, I enjoyed working with you. I thought we shared duties well, and seemed to work together in an easy and efficient manner.
 - (from Jared)When Jeneve and I paired for the Hyde project, she admitted that she was struggling at Turing. That honesty carried through the rest of our DTR as she was able to both clearly express her desires and current situation, while listening to and demonstrating understanding of mine. Despite her self-claimed struggles, Jeneve quickly demonstrated her ability to comprehend and break down problems algorithmically. As she would tell you herself, her biggest struggle coming into the project was workflow / computer navigation. Although I have observed her getting stronger in this area through intentional effort in each project, I believe this is the one area that will most benefit her when improved.

#### To peers
 - Ashwin is flexible and patient. He's easy-going but stays on task and encourages his pairing partner to do the same. I'd welcome the opportunity to work with him again.
 - Jared and I teamed up to build 'Hyde', a lightweight application for blogging. Both our partnership and our project were a success. Jared is very detail-oriented with a keen eye for making code attractive, readable and orderly; I learned a lot about refactoring from him. He was always very positive and collected even when we faced setbacks. Jared is patient and kind, he thinks fast and is always helping others.
 - (to Mark) I’m really liking working with you. We are moving slow but I am optimistic that we will be happy we rebooted yesterday, and I know things will speed up from here. I really appreciate being given the chance to drive sometimes, and you have always been very patient and kind when I do. I have learned several short cuts from watching you drive too. Also, your spreadsheet-fu is unexpectedly super-useful in the project. Not least, I am having fun whenever we work together; your ability to put people at ease will take you a long way.

## Community

During the first module, I have taken a lot more from the community than I have given, but whenever possible, I have tried to look for ways that I will be able to enrich the community in the in the coming months by close listening and engaging in discussion with my peers in the module and in other modules, and  through reflection on what has helped me to make it this far. I have never ceased to be amazed at the determination and passion of the students at Turing, who seem to go to any length to succeed. I have identified two areas where I have expertise that is in high demand among many students at Turing; writing craftsmanship and visual design. I have begun work on a lightning talk that will help students improve the form of their writing, and I have a rough sketch in mind for an expansion on the talk for a student led elective. In brief, simple rules can be applied to vastly improve one's writing, or, at least, to point out problem areas. I'd like to lead a session in which students would build a simple program that takes a string of text, looks for common problems, and makes simple substitutions or flags and provides feedback. I think this would be an effective way to deliver the information because students would walk away with exhaustive notes on the process of proofreading in the form of code that was fun to make.

### Posse Challenges

Working for a half hour each morning with my posse on a challenge has been valuable. My favorite challenge was Enumerables and Procs, because it was within my ability to make a meaningful contribution. Even when the challenge was above my ability, I learned from watching my posse-mates solve the problem. I'm looking forward to next Module's challenges because I know I'm ready to get more involved in the coding of solutions and helping our new members join in and feel welcomed the way I was welcomed.

## Review

# Portfolio Rubric

Your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.


* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of engagement or growth in their individual
skill or project outcomes without a clear upward trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 4: Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback
to shape their own character and behavior.

OUTCOME: PROMOTED
