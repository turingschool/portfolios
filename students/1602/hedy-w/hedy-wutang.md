* [Original Assignment]()

### Team: Chris Soden, Jon Liss-is-more, self

  Rush Hour was a three person project, and the first of module 2. The goal was to recreate a baby google analytics, using the Sinatra DSL and ActiveRecord.

  Evaluation Rubric

  Team: Jonathan Liss & Christopher Soden & Hedy Woo Evaluator: Rachel

  Notes:

  all iterations are complete; data in iteration 8 is not scoped per client
  client methods tested for muliple clients sometimes, but not consistent
  feature tests looked good -- good use of scoping to specific HTML elements
  good use of ActiveRecord for queries
  views looked good -- no logic leaking through
  inclusion of module in server file is somewhat confusing - sets instance variables without being clear
  some methods in Client Parser module should be built in Event, Url, and Client classes

  The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

  1. Functional Expectations

  3: Application fulfills base expectations

  2. Test-Driven Development

  3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

  3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

  3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

  4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

  3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

  5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

  3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

  6. View Layer

  3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view
  While you won't be graded on workflow for Rush Hour, here's an example of how you will be evaluated on workflow later in the module:

##Feedback Received from Members of Team Vim:
  From Jon Liss-is-more:
  Hedy,  I know we joke around a lot, but I just want you to know how much I enjoyed getting to know you.  You’re a fantastic teammate, very smart, and just a fun person in general.  You immediately grabbed the unofficial project leader in Rush Hour and honestly, the project would have gone way different if you hadn’t.  Your work ethic is tremendous, and you’re passionate about learning.  You are a fantastic natural leader, (maybe too good… who assigns homework during a project??) and have a knack for organizing and reaching goals.  I know you’re a much better programmer than you give yourself credit for, and in my eyes you’re definitely among the best in the class.  Thanks for being so honest with me, and calling me out on anything I do that’s not up to par.  I appreciate that you’re always pushing me to be better no matter what, it’s very inspiring.  Lastly, I just wanted you to know that above all, you’re just genuinely a good, caring person who’s always looking out for others.  Give yourself just a little more credit and you’ll go incredibly far as a programmer. 

  From Chris:
  I think you did a great job driving the pace of our Rush Hour project. And you were so positive and cheerful the whole time, even when the project was stressful it was a pleasure to work with you. Your insight and experience were a tremendous boon in the project.

##Feedback Given to Team Vim:

  Jon Liss-is-more:
  Jon, Team Vim Rush Hour would not be what it is without you, for sure. I'd hate to admit that your impact on the team project was great, but it really was. I'd also hate to admit that I took a lot of pleasure watching you figure things out, and fastly at that, but on this too, I think I might have to say you are not sorta good, but pretty good. As far as constructive criticism I can offer, there's quite a lot, but I'll start with this: stop bribing me to set your vim dotfile. I won't. I'll let you figure it out on your own in the crucible, as I did, or just show up to the student-led session in two weeks. Second: stop proselityzing people with your C++ gospel to your project teammates, I'm language agnostic. There's more, of course, but for now, the above suffice. All in all, it was super fun to partner with you, and your availability and flexibility with things really made working on this project painless for the rest of us.

  Chris:
  Chris, it was quite nice to have you in the Rush-Hour Team Vim. Having you in the team probably modulated all the trash talking that went around with the other two in Team Vim. And that was certainly nice. Thanks for your contribution on writing tests, and debugging, and redirecting us when the other loud blabberers were going the wrong way with the project. The biggest impact you probably made for me personally, was when you and I sat down to refactor one of the iterations, and just listening to you, as you were processing what was going on in the code was very enlightening. Going forward, I would hope you to speak up more when the other members start dominating the group conversation, and I know that the reason you might hold back at times, is because you are a gentleman. Also, thanks for helping me divvy up the tutoring session and taking over my assigned slot, so that I could spend that time with another student. Hope to have more opportunities to pair with you!

##Feedback Received from Super Coders team: 
  Sighing Sal: 
  Hedy! It was so nice to work with you on Little Shop. You have a bright personality that always seems to make the work go a little easier. I was surprised by the number of times I looked up to realize how late in the day it was without having noticed how the time had passed. You have high standards, and our project is definitely better because of the demands you put on the team. I think my main feedback would be to give yourself a break every now and again. There’s a ton to learn, and we’re not going to know it all right away, but I don’t think you give yourself enough credit for how much you do know. You’re super knowledgeable and definitely kept me on the right track more than a few times.

  Thom:
  Hedy, I was really glad we worked together on this project. You’re very passionate, and driven to get the most out of everything you work on. You definitely pushed us to make the best app we could have. I was impressed with your ability to both figure out what you needed to implement features you wanted, and look up the sources on how to do them, and that you never seem to be daunted by what you have to do.

##Feedback Given to Super Coders team:
  Sighing Sal:
  I could throw quite a lot of good superlatives on Sal, and prove them all true. I didn’t know Sal prior to Little Shop, but I pegged him to be on my dream team.  I was just too lucky to have that realized (thank you Student.sample!).  Sal is a rock star!! Not just in terms of what he knows, but also in the way he organizes his thoughts.  He consistently goes for what is the most essential down to the least. He is not succumbed by low level details or distractions found within the projects.  He also had to deal with two ill teammates from the midpoint of the project on, and so he did a lot of the heavy-lifting, especially towards the end.  And while, this would ordinarily be a point of sore contention, he never made any of us feel guilty.  Our project is a whole lot better than what it would have otherwise been because of him. Sal’s also very giving. He’s the king of snacks, and only eats what he can share.  That says so much about his personhood!  I would hope that ruby Student.sample would grant me more opportunities to pair and learn from him.  Thanks for the goodtimes!

  Thom:
  Thom I’m quite astounded and surprised at how much you’ve grown as a programmer since module 1, and our HTTP-YYKM project.  You definitely dove deep and all in to learn this stuff, and it showed during the Little Shop. Glad to see you taking on side challenges as well with your mentor.  Sorry you fell ill (probably b/c of me - but hopefully not) during the project, but thanks for your willingness to do some work once you started to feel better.  I know this last week was tough on you physically, but I think you handled it well.  I’m looking forward to see your excitement for programming grow even more on mod 3.  I think it’ll be exciting.

### Giving Feedback

  Jeneve: 
  Jeneve, I was glad to pair with you for your mini-rails. You definitely got style, and it was probably the nicest looking site among the show and tells.

  Marina:
  Our k-drama mini-rails project was fun! And it was because of you.  Your TDD skills are impressive, and you definitely have something to teach me about that.  I hope we get to pair more going forwards because I need some of your TDD magic.

###Receiving all these unsolicited feedbacks:

  Marina:
  Hedy was a great partner to work with. She was a a friend when I needed a friend, very supportive and also helped teach me a lot about rails and better studying habits.  She has also taught me how to laugh more and enjoy projects.

  Jeneve:
  Hedy’s mini project was unique because she took on many advanced challenges on the back end. She experimented with different ways to route actions and refactor. I learned a lot from checking out her code.

### Being a Community Member

  Plan is to be a super learner and excel at this eventually! Big plan is to succeed in this, so I can tackle grander problems. The issue of human trafficking is one, homelessness is another (no human should be without shelter), there's so much to do, and so little time!  

  I'm in (but mostly out of the) the Ritchie Posse.  My main draw for joining this group were initally three reasons: 1. no early morning meetings, 2. Scott 2. Kimi (it's a tie). Incidentally, I loved meeting the other folks in the posse, especially the folks from 1603. 

### Playing a Part

  within Turing:   Like Justice John Paul Stevens, I was a good conscientious dissenter at Turing, when I could be. 

  without Turing:   Serving breakfast to the homeless community with DCC on Pearl St, most Tuesday mornings at 6:30am.
