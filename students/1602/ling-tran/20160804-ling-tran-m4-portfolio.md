## __Self-Assessment__
---

### A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4"s on the assessment (Module 3 requires three or more "4"s)

### B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.


### C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony while achieving consistently satisfactory results.


### D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two above-and-beyond supports of the community.

### E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.

Yay, JavaScript and back to almost basics, Rails!

Evaluation:
  * Satisfactory Progress: 3
  * Ruby Syntax & Style: 3
  * Rails Style & API: 4

* [Evaluation](https://github.com/lingtran/idea_box/blob/master/idea-box-eval.md)

Instructor feedback:
  * Really strong use of es6 and breaking things out. Cool feature for extra credit. Duplication of code in the JS is really the only thing to point out, but as you keep learning about this it'll be easier to refactor (probably already easier actually).

## __Team Projects__

---
I completed the following paired work this module:

* GameTime

#### GameTime
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lingtran/qbert)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)
* [Final Submission](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1602/module_4_assignments/gametime/qbert/final-submission.md)
* [Production URL](http://qbert.rocks)

More JavaScript. Completely client-side application. Learned about LocalStorage and how to write JS in object-oriented way. Asynchronicity is interesting.

Project Partners: Kami, Sal

Points: 295/300

* Functional Expectations: 35 points
  - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expecations set by instructors
* User Interface: 15 points
 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
* Testing: 30 points
 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite convers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.
* JavaScript Style: 25 points
 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* Workflow: 25 points
 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
* The output from JSHint shows...: 15 points
 - Zero complaints

#### Feedback to Me

**Project Partners' feedback**

* Sal | GameTime:

>  Ling! What can I say that hasn't already been said. I think that it's great that you are continuously looking for feedback and checking to see how you can improve/contribute. I liked that you were frequently looking to use new tools, and to incorporate them into the work we were doing. The one thing I would say (and that I think I've said) is that it's important to be flexible in those situations, especially when things aren't working. I feel as though I've had some great moments when I've walked into a problem that another team was having and been helpful simply because I was able to help them abandon their idea of what ​*should*​ be working. I frequently find that when I'm stuck on something that ​*should*​ be working, that I know in my heart shouldn't be breaking, is the time when it's best to accept that (despite what I might think I know) it's ​*not*​ working and try something else. That said, there's obviously a balance to be struck, and we'll never learn anything new/more efficient if we always go with the easy path. You were my first friend at Turing, and it was nice to have this chance to work with you. I can't wait to see where you end up next.

* Kami | GameTime:

> Ling is an excellent teammate who brings a lot of energy and a little levity to any group. From the very beginning, she prioritized very direct, honest communication and I think that her approach was key to the group dynamic that we established over the course of our project. Ling is an excellent coder and debugger who is able to communicate a clear vision of what she wants to create. Ling, I was so glad that you were part of my last group project at Turing, and I’m so happy that I got to go through this experience with you. I’m excited to see what you do next!

**Feedback from peers outside of team projects**

* Deb Hamel, 1511/1602/1603 | Pairings :

> Ling, you are one of strongest and most productive programmers at Turing. You have been one of my most influential supporters and you have made me a stronger a more confident programmer with  advice, pairing and friendship. Your heart is big, brave and beautiful. Try not to over analyze yourself. Can’t wait to see the amazing things you will to as a developer.

### Giving Feedback
** Project partners' feedback**

* Sal | GameTime:

> Sal was a great project manager for the team. He was understanding about his teammates' emotional needs but also kept us on track. Like Kami, he is extremely skilled at abstractions and breaking down logic. So I feel lucky to have been able to consider both Sal and Kami my teachers during Game Time. Sal rocks, which is why Turing is keeping him!

* Kami | GameTime:

> Kami is really skilled at abstracting concepts and her naming game is strong, which are weakness areas I am working on improving. As such, I learned a lot working with her during Game Time. I don't have anything but positive things to say about Kami. Any team would be lucky to have her. Go Kami!

### Being a Community Member
**Feedback to peers outside of project teams**

* Deb Hamel, 1511/1602/1603 | Pairings :

> Deb, you are an integral member of the Turing community. A few days ago, we paired for hours in the evening on building and consuming APIs. You have exhibited noticeable growth in your own confidence and have stopped questioning what you know less. I am glad we got to develop a concrete technique to help hone in on how to improve your technical skills because I think you have a good grasp of the other psychological factors. One noticeable thing you can do to work faster is improving your work flow! Spectacle can be awesome. (^o^) All of these are things we discussed. I am so proud of you! Thinking about how we met through Girl Develop It in Classroom B, it's amazing how life brings people together. I hope you continue on this path and we will definitely keep in touch.

### Playing a Part
* Clojure Club learning...exercisms and support from Horace.
* Pre-work guide.
* I have not been an asshole, at least not intentionally.
* Lola gives her regards.
