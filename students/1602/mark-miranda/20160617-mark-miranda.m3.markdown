### Areas of Emphasis

My emphasis going into module 3 is to come out feeling like a real developer. It's technically a downhill slide and I've mathematically made it to the halfway point, but I feel like module 3 is still an uphill climb. I want to power through and emphasize to myself, my cohort, and my family, why I deserve to be here and be counted among those who proudly call themselves *a Turing alum*. I believe this starts in module 3. I want to grab onto, absorb, and become proficient in as much information as I possibly can and succeed through module 3.

I would also like to become a staple in the Turing community. A person that earlier modules can reach out to when in need. I have been voted into SAB and want to be a voice for students to speak their fears and help change things for the better, but also celebrate their victories.

### End of Module Assessment

### Notes

* Good use of VCR in your feature tests, but...
* You committed your cassettes, and thus your API key
* Tests map very well to user stories. Good coverage and good value, but...
* No service test
* Good use of strong params, but...
* Could use `require` to be more railsy. Not that we asked for it.
* Service logic is very well laid out
* Clear model PORO. I get why you called it `Result`, but I'd prefer a more descriptive name.
* Thin controller using only models, but...
* Could move hours logic somewhere else, like the model, a helper or a presenter

## Evaluated Projects

I completed the following evaluated projects this module:
## Self Directed Project - Passport Helper

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/notmarkmiranda/passport-helper)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

This was a 2 week self-directed project where we were had to bring it all together. We were expected to consume an external API, use an external OAuth, and implement a quality user interface.

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the following criteria:

## Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/notmarkmiranda/rails-engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/b81770c004ff6003a14428d30c8f5061fb817d73/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

This was a project that was assigned over four days in Week 4 of Module 3 at the Turing School. The goals of this project was to provide an API built in Rails and test an internal API. Additional features are implementation of more custom ActiveRecord queries and calculations. TDD utilized request tests implemented in RSpec.

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the following criteria:

Notes: - great use of AR - could move some repeated code into application contoller (respond to) - Test were good. Some test could be a little more explicit. Overall great coverage

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

Your Little Shop of Orders application was almost great, but it turns out that we need to pivot the business model. In this project, you'll build upon an existing implementation of Little Shop. You will transform your restaurant ordering site into a platform that handles multiple, simultaneous businesses. Each business will have their own name, unique URL pattern, items, orders, and administrators.

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the following criteria:

 Notes: Good use of presenter. Overall solid project. While there is a 2 for testing it's not a "failing" project. Some oversight on the use of Simplecov by not passing the "rails" parameter.

## Community

### Giving Feedback


>**To Kami Boers:** This is easily the best group I've been a part of. I don't think I had to worry once about what you were doing and if you were going to get it done. You were strong in your development while still being able to see the big picture. The only criticism I have was getting stuck in the rabbit hole of resetting a password on the final day when we were trying to push to heroku. I don't know if that's even a real criticism because it did get done, just not in the timebox you had set for yourself. You're easygoing and a pleasure to work with. Communication was great and never an issue. 10/10 would work with again.

>**To Thom Pickett:** This is easily the best group I've been a part of. You were able to get features done with great quality code, as well as keep an eye on the edge cases, bugs, and holes we were creating with new features. My criticism is there were times when new functionality would come into the project without testing that eventually broke old functionality. You were however quick to fix those bugs when we found them. You also were great at picking up any tasks we could tack on or that came up randomly. Communication was great and never an issue. 10/10 would work with again.




### Feedback to Me

>**From Kami Boers:** Always a pleasure, you seem to be on the right level all the time, and you helped to keep us moving forward when we could have gotten stuck.  I liked that we were all willing to work hard to get the project done, but also equally willing to take breaks, leave the building, or do whatever it took to be productive. Your styling is by far the best that I’ve seen from our cohort, and you should be incredibly proud of your ability to put out a professional project.  Thanks for being a great teammate and a generally awesome person to be around. I’d love to work with you in the future.

>**From Thom Pickett:** Mark is very motivated, has an extremely hard work drive. He's gets done, what needs to, and then makes jokes mostly about whoever is around him. One of Mark's greatest strengths seems to be to look up how to code something he has no idea how to do, and then implement it in a short amount of time.

>**From Trent Whitinger:** Mark was my pre-work mentor, as well as in my micro-posse for the first three weeks of Turing, He was incredibly supportive and always willing to look at code as well as help other mod1 students. He was available every day early before school to bounce ideas off of and  help me elucidate my thoughts. Thanks a lot Mark!

>**From Raphael Barbo:** Mark is undoubtedly one of the most active members of the community. The amount of positive comments I have personally heard about him throughout module 1 is overwhelming!! I had the opportunity to work with Mark in many occasions, from individual projects pairing to Student Advisory Board, Mark has been an extremely welcoming, helpful, and honest person. I believe that is exactly the kind of personality Turing should be targeting to join the school, and I honestly believe that Mark is a great example of student, community member, and mentor. It is a huge pleasure being able to count on him to help me out and guide me throughout my time at Turing. I can't wait to see what he is gonna be accomplishing once he graduates.

>**From Tommasina Miller:** What would I have done my first three weeks of Turing without Mark as a micro-posse mentor? Every morning without fail, he was sitting waiting for us at the pairing station. He guided me through many last-minute fixes for projects and reassured me through an entirely overwhelming period of academic growth. It's been nice to see his friendly face around Turing since then, and I really appreciate his continued willingness to help out with projects since the end of our micro-posse.



### Playing a Part
* I was a leader in micro posse 3. We dealt with issues on current projects or assignments with module 1 students. We met daily at 8:30am in the workspace.

* I was part of SAB this module and helped gather, sort, and voice student concerns. I helped lead group retros on Fridays and alternated attending staff retros.

* I have been a pre-work guide for incoming cohorts for two consecutive modules. I think having that connection to an existing Turing student helps relieve some of the anxiety that many incoming students face. And to have someone that you already know, that can also help with learning here is a valuable asset.

* I paired with module 1 students weekly to help them through projects, understanding Ruby concepts, and just living at Turing as a whole.

* I have started attending Denver.rb monthly meetups to become more immersed in the Denver tech scene as a whole.

* ReadMe Sample from [Passport Helper](https://github.com/notmarkmiranda/passport-helper/blob/master/readme.md)
