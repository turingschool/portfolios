# Mark Miranda - M2 Portfolio


## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I want to maintain momentum moving into module 2. I feel like I finished as strong as I planned to in module 1 and do not want to slow down. I want to be a bigger part of the community at Turing and attend meetups & other industry-related events and volunteer my time where possible, whether it be helping out module 1 students or taking the opportunity to be a pre-work guide for the incoming 1605 cohort.

## Evaluated Projects

I completed the following evaluated projects this module:

## Little Shop - NachomomsPaleo

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kristindiannefoss/little_shop)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

This was a 2 week project where we built a functional e-commerce store to sell dinosaur meat from scratch. We were evaluated by Rachel with the following results:

## Evaluation Process

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the
following criteria:

### 1. Feature Completeness

* 3: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented

### 2. Views

* 3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through

### 3. Controllers

* Score: 3.5

* 4: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack
* 3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts

### 4. Models

* Score: 3.5

* 4: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features
* 3: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring

### 5. Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

### 6. Usability

* 3: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready

### 7. Workflow

* Score: 3.5

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.
* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.


## Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/drew-t/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

This was a 7 day project where we built a Sintra w/PostgreSQL application that was used to evaluate payload data. We were evaluated by Andrew with the following results:

Team: Andrew Thompson & Ling Tran & Mark Miranda Evaluator: Andrew github: github.com/drew-t/rush-hour

Notes: Test numbers are decent. Use preferred syntax for hashes. Data prep for testing was overkill, use minimum required data for tests. Add notes on code during PRs. Be explicit on PRs for what you completed.



#### 1. Functional Expectations
  * 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development
  * 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  * 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  * 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic
  * 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer
  * 3.5: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

---
## Non-Evaluated Work

#### Rails Mini Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/notmarkmiranda/rails-mini-project)

This was a 4 day project that set us up to be in a good place to start Little Shop. I learned a lot based on repetition of concepts we had learned in class, but utilized very little in practice.

#### MixMaster

* [Github URL](https://github.com/notmarkmiranda/mix_master)

MixMaster was a great project to help bring a lot of rails concepts together. It was great exposure to deloying to Heroku and using RSpec.


#### Tool Chest

* [Github URL](https://github.com/notmarkmiranda/tool_chest)

This was a project in rails that taught us CRUD functionality as well as user authentication and authorization. I found this really helpful going into little shop.

#### Robot World

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/notmarkmiranda/robot_world)

This was a Sinatra CRUD project that introduced us to basics of the model view controller and emphasized SRP.

### Giving Feedback


>**To Drew Thompson:** Charmander has great leadership abilities and helped keep us focused the milestones we needed to hit. He has a great grasp on the concepts as we learn them and the ability to implement them. He also made sure we understood the concepts and the overall picture as well as importance of what we were doing and spending our time. I hope to be paired with Charmander on a project in the future.

>**To Ling Tran:** Bulbasaur is very focused on writing tests and having it drive the development of our code. She's very focused on details without losing focus on the goals to achieve certain functionality. Bulbasaur writes extremely clean and well-formatted code. She's very easy to work with and a great part of any group. She also sings a lot and brings snacks. I hope to be paired with Bulbasaur on a project in the future.

>**To Kriss Foss:** Kris is a great addition to any team. She has creativity and knowledge past her own beliefs. She creates great code and has a great workflow that helps drive production. She's able to push through tough challenges with awesome efficiency. She's not afraid to ask the right questions when she comes across difficulty. My only criticism is that she needs more confidence in her code and focus on breaking problems down to smaller pieces. Kris is a hard worker an great teammate and I look forward to working with her in the future.

>**To Deborah Hamel:** Deb is an amazing teammate. She was the spirit of the team and kept our stress level low and the project moving in the right direction. She was always ready with solutions when walls in thought process or code came up. She helped keep the lines of communication open when we were approaching stressful times and deadlines by just talking through things. A skill that is easily overlooked as something that changes the dynamic of groups. My only criticism for Deb is that she needs to be more confident in her opinions. She has a lot of knowledge and skill, but seems to doubt herself when a problem arises.  I would be happy to be in a group with Deb anytime.



### Feedback to Me

>**From Drew Thompson:** Mark was very helpful throughout the project.  He was instrumental in styling our site as well.  He was constantly working alongside Ling and myself providing input to whatever we were working on at the time.  He paired very well and let everyone suggest ideas and provided useful and positive feedback regularly.

>**From Ling Tran:** Squirtle is very versatile. He is strong in every possible way, in addition to being a fun and compassionate team member. He is tenacious with debugging - using tools to pry into the issue rather than just thinking and talking about possible sources for issues. I learned to be more tenacious in this way by working with Squirtle. The only area of improvement I can identify in working with Squirtle is perhaps being more patient with other people's workflow! Other than that, with an established rapport, I imagine working with Squirtle will be just as awesome again.

>**From Kriss Foss:** I am so happy to have had the chance to work with Mark.  He’s methodical and precise, diligent and determined.  He is inclusive and encouraging.  Mark’s programming skills are incredibly advanced.  It was great to be working alongside him and hearing his problem solving process.  He has an insatiable drive to succeed and enthusiasm to learn more and he is inspiring to watch.  I have learned a lot from being in his group.  As a very strong technical programmer, he took a project lead role and helped guide us towards a beautiful finished product.  He is a great leader and he shows respect and patience.  If I had to offer criticism, I would ask him if he doesn’t push himself too hard, and if he gives himself credit for the amazing work he produces, but maybe that’s part of what lights the fire inside of him.  Not only is he brilliant, beyond talented, but he’s also a great person and someone you would want on your team or in your office.

>**From Deborah Hamel:** Mark is an amazing project manager. I feel lucky to have worked with him on the LittleShop project. His leadership skills and artfully collaborative workflow are only exceeded by his strong and insightful coding skills. He can just get things done. He hardly every gets stuck, but is always willing to help others and work through issues. He is so easy to get along with and finds ways for a team to feel consistently cohesive and on track. Sometimes I think he puts others first and sacrifices his own time and priorities. I would encourage him to always remember to take care of himself too.

### Playing a Part
* I am an active member of the Brin posse. I use weekday mornings before school and some time on weekends working on Ruby problems and exercisms. I like the posse reboot from the standpoint of being able to choose something I'm personally interested in, but I preferred the idea of non-standard competition between posses.

* I have weekly screen hero mentor sessions with Travis Yoder. We generally work on refactoring whatever current project I'm working on or work on Exercisms I'm not comfortable with or stuck on.


* I am active in 1602 as a community member as well. I push to help us grow as a group and encourage each other to do well. I have offered to help other students understand concepts that may be unfamiliar. I have also printed stickers for the cohort to help identify and be proud of us as a group, while finding a way to not exclude students who may be repeating.

* I paired with module 1 students weekly to help them through projects, understanding Ruby concepts, and just living at Turing as a whole.

* I have started attending Denver.rb monthly meetups to become more immersed in the Denver tech scene as a whole.
