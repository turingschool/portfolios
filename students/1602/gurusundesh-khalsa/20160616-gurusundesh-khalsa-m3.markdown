# Gurusundesh Khalsa - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

I'm really humbled at the moment. I didn't really think I would enjoy coding this much(I did like it before!), but I am finding myself more and more just deeply enjoying the work. Something I am so grateful about. I think mod 3 is a special time. It's like you worked really hard getting all the ingredients, cooking, cleaning, waiting... and then you get some of that sweet sweet home cookin.

  - Should check for count difference in delete request
  - I like the note on why you added a random comment.
  - API key should be pulled into method for DRYness
  - Good use of Store object being sent to the view

#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GKhalsa/pivot_ticket)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

Take a pre-existing codebase(a pdf shop) and pivot that code into a stubhub-esque site with multitenancy.

**Instructor**: Nate

* Tests Passed
* MVC is solid, but could thin out big methods and move things into POROs  
* Views are good, except for that thing that surprised Sunny  
* Clever solution to Permissions problem, clever in the good and bad way.  
* Except for a little jank, UI is clean  
* Routes file is slightly inconsistent with itself. Using different patterns to solve the same problem.  
* My face  
* QR Codes! Welcome to the future!

The Amazon seer is born

**Instructor**: Nate

*  Worry about the value of the tests, not the coverage number. Tests make sure your app is working still.  
* Cool pagination code. Next time, just update the bootstrap-pagination gem for the new version.  
* Go make some money with this app  
* Logic is well broken out  
* Great application of MVC

### Giving Feedback

**Jeneve Parrish**: I had a really wonderful experience working with you. I was seriously impressed about how you were able to adapt to Drew and my coding styles, styles that would appear to clash with your more tdd approach. This however was not an issue, and I think speaks volumes to your both comfort and understanding of code => which leads to your flexibility. You are an extremely hard worker which is amazing considering the lack of sleep you were getting. I also appreciate how consistently curious you were about the code that Drew and I were implementing. I think that curiosity will continue to push your skills. As far as something constructive, I think you are overall doing really well, however I think you have a tendency to put logic in the views, such as chaining active record attributes and associations. From what I understand flow control is not the worst to have in the views, but things like that can be cut out to helper methods.

**Drew Thompson**: I had a lot of fun working with you on our pivot project. You were really easy going and very open to collaboration, which isn't always qualities that strong coders have. You were also very accommodating with my wanting to take on unfamiliar territory, especially when it was new material that you were curious about as well. I am really grateful for that. Working with you also reveals that you have a good mix of skills that help drive projects without too many hiccups. For something constructive, I think there could have been better communication(definitely on my part as well), but with you taking on the role of project manager, I feel that entails a bit more of that responsibility to at least prompt communication and status checks. However, towards the end I feel that this considerably improved.

### Being a Community Member

Sunny, you are relentless when it comes to figuring things out, you never give up. You always asked the question that was on my mind in our client meetings and many more that I could never articulate. I sometimes felt that we weren't on the same page with time management- that you were frequently taking a break when I really wanted to be moving forward and needed your input, or that you weren't around at important decision time. This is not only your problem- we all needed to be more clear about when we would work together and and then to BE available to one another during those times, even when we are working on different parts.  **-Jeneve Parrish-**

"Sunny is one of the people at Turing most available to help out when projects become difficult. Even when he is in the midst of his own projects, he has taken the time to help me on my projects, and he offers great insights into errors. I appreciate his patient explanations and willingness to engage with people and ask if earlier module people need help, even if they aren't super comfortable asking themselves." **-Marcella Wigg-**

 "Sunny's personality was always a boon to be around.  He is always positive even when he's struggling.  The biggest issue that I ran into working with Sunny is his communication.  He will at times talk in circles about something, trying to describe something he's doing or why something isn't working correctly.  It can be very confusing.  I think my biggest piece of advice to him is to slow down before he starts to explain complex ideas so that he has it straight in his own mind before he puts it into words for someone else.  This had a negative impact on the project at times because I would be frustrated with a lack of understanding of what Sunny was doing/working on.  It wasn't a flaw that ruined the project, by any means, just the most obvious thing he could work on." **-Drew Thompson-**

 "Sunny is a great member of the Turing community whom I have really enjoyed talking with over the course of the mod. He is perceptive and cares about understanding the interpersonal dynamics of teams and the Turing community. I also appreciate his approach to problem solvingâ€”one of curiosity rather than fear or frustration." **-Erin Greenhalgh-**
