### Giving Feedback

**Sal Espinosa**: "Picture this. You have Ali, Jeneve, and myself(Sunny) shouting out random programming esque words. A lot of the time we were agreeing, a lot of the time there were differences. Everybody drunk on programming passion with a side of frustration. The way this works is with a guy like Sal. He simultaneously could listen to three different people and wield his keyboard to implement all ideas to their true potential, letting everybody make their mark while rebasing our emotions. I feel fortunate that I had an opportunity to work with you man."

**Jared Roth**: "I'm so impressed with Jared. I mean seriously, he had a lot of huge life events take place during our project. He had to leave for 4 days, I'm sure he had a ton on his mind. Yet... I felt like he was always there. It is incredible. You could show him 5 pull requests and then all of a sudden he was completely on board, showing us potential bugs with a total understanding of the project. He has a plethora of good ideas and always knows how to implement tricky things. Super solid programmer. "

**Alireza Anderson**: "Ali was such a great partner to have on Rush Hour. His passion for programming is infectious. You can really tell this guy wants it. During the project he had some personal setbacks that would have made most people freak out. During those times you see peoples true colors. True to how he is he took it all in stride with a smile on his face. Pushing the project on and on. Thanks man!"

**Josh Washke**: "Working with Josh is a surreal experience. Things just work. You want to try some crazy feature, it's going to work. You want to try xyz, yeah they are going to work too. But it's not magic, it's because he has a fierce programming toolkit with a debugging prowess that will make your head spin. Josh is extremely capable, but at the same time he is always willing to hear out other ideas or go down different routes of curiosity that his teammates might have. Super humble dude. Something something constructive criticism I have no Idea."  

**Jeneve Parrish**: "I got to work on a project with Jeneve after having never done so, nor really having gotten to know her. I missed out. She's dope. She's extremely passionate about programming and was incredibly dedicated. Sometimes I think that enthusiasm might have pushed her into some rabbit holes. But that is how you learn baby! ~"

### Being a Community Member

"Sunny is one of those students at Turing who, no matter what, will ALWAYS be willing to help. He will work for hours on someone else’s problem fueled only by his curiosity and compassion. He is such a radiating presence who makes even the most tedious code problem, enjoyable. It’s so refreshing getting to interact with someone who makes such a conscious effort to maintain a growth mindset on a daily basis.  Thank you sunny for being so open thus allowing for others to benefit from your unique perspective." **-Karina Gonzalez-**

"I finally had the opportunity to work pair with Gurusundesh on a project and not just for fun! The Mythical Creature creator is truly mythical when it comes to his coding approach.  His out of the box thinking helps us figure out issues that we would get stuck on. His positive vibe kept us all motivated when we were between a rock and a hard place. Overall I think Sunny is a great programmer and I know will succeed in this industry and leave a mark that will always remind us of the "Sunny days”." **-Alireza Anderson-**

"Working with Sunny on the project Rush Hour was a pleasure. He is positive and hard-working, a great team-player. Sunny clearly LOVES programming and it shows in his technical ability and inquisitiveness. Sunny NEEDS to know why a thing is happening or is the way it is, which makes him excellent and relentless at debugging. Sometimes this quality might be a liability when a problem is, in fact, solved, but nobody knows why- Sunny’s still working on it! Sunny is fun and caring and would be an asset to any team. I hope I get to work with him again!" **-Jeneve Parrish-**

" It was good to work with you after not having the opportunity in mod one. You definitely helped to keep us on track, and seemed to do a good job of filling in knowledge that somehow the rest of us had missed. You're a patient team member, and generally seemed willing to go down a different paths as we were figuring out how to do something, which was great in a group of four. You had a nice way of recommending a change/pushing us to try a different approach. It's hard to come up with something to recommend to you. It seems like you pretty much have things under control, and if you keep going I'm betting things will come keep coming up roses." **-Sal Espinosa-**

"Sunny is exceptionally easy to work with. He always makes it a point to ensure that you know you've been heard when discussing potentially opposing views on a topic before offering his counterpoint. Since we were forced to work on different sides of the country for much of the project, I think that his git workflow was improved tremendously, but it also revealed how each member of the team has room to improve understanding of the git tools available to us and establishing best practices for distributed projects. This is one area I can see easy growth in the near future." **-Jared Roth-**

"Sunny, working with you on Little shop was a treat. Working with for a short time quickly reveals you have a strong enthusiasm and curiosity for programming, two traits that I think will carry you very far in the field. We have very similar learning styles in our need to dig into code and really understand how its working, rather than trusting that it works implicitly. The only constructive feedback I can give you is to take care in your ambitions when it comes to projects. You have really excellent ideas, and I think that enthusiasm will help you as I feel the best way to learn is to get in over your head, but when under a time crunch its important to not commit to too many or too ambitious ideas. Overall though I don’t think that affected the project any in any way, just hope its something you keep in mind in future projects. I think our project went fantastic and would love to work with you again in the future." **-Josh Washke-**
