# Feedback

### Feedback For Others
- For Marina Corona: In regards to what Jeff said about different ways to approach potential barriers, I feel like Marina is in the 5%. I've seen this manifest in her work and in the way she deals with problems. To say she hustles would be an understatement, however the other side to this is that you can often see her feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. Thinking through problems instead of the more brute force approach might serve her better. At the same time I've seen this persistance carry her entire team through when otherwise they might have crashed and burned. It's a great quality but seems like it needs a little refining in order to not burn her out.

- For Alex Navarrete: Working with Alex on gametime was the best paired experience I've had at Turing. I'm continually blown away at his discipline and work ethic. Any differences or disagreements we had with code, rare as they were, were handled so well that they always lead to a better feature. More than anything it was also just an enjoyable experience. Pairing can be tough at times, but this felt more like a celebration of code. I think at times he can get stuck on a certain idea or way of thinking about a problem, but once a solution was found he would stay curious and want to understand how it worked in order to improve. Keep that up! I look forward to working with you again sometime!

- For Jon Liss: Oh John, oh excuse me Jon, Mr. Thinks he's too good for the letter h! We'll back in my day when Jon's were Johns and Potato was pronounced Potato(did you do the potaaato thing in your head hah! Now I'm in your head, yes you are trying to think about something other than ol' Sunny here, well, it's too late! That super secret thing you were thinking of last night, well I know it now!). Well anyways what was I talking about, oh, uh Jon's alright. [The letter H is the most contentious letter in our alphabet](www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2013/nov/04/letter-h-contentious-alphabet-history-alphabetical-rosen)

- For Matt Pindell: Just like how physicists talk about third and fourth dimension beings, sometimes I think Matt might actually just be a thesaurus. A goddamn beautiful thesaurus. Seriously though, Matt adds so much to everything; 1602, Turing, hanging out. He's a fucking solid coder and I'm super grateful to have gone through this experience with him.

- For Mark Miranda: Mark is the heart of 1602. I think it can go without being said as I'm sure you have already read this from other feedback(aimed at instructors, let's break that fourth wall) that he is an amazing coder, mentor, pairing buddy, friend. That's kind of obvious. He's also just a solid dude that is there for everybody. I've been able to see this more and more as I've been on SAB with him. He's always super thoughtful and has great insight when there have been a couple small hiccups within our cohort. Super thankful to have gone on this wild ride with The Miranda™

### Feedback Received
- From Marina Corona: Sunny is a great friend and a great partner to pair with. He learns quickly and is passionate about what he learns. In fact, he’s the only person I know who makes stickers of all the languages and gems he loves. But in all seriousness, I’m amazed by all the work that Sunny has put in throughout this program.  He puts in extra hours and stays late everyday and is constantly excited to share his work with his peers.  From leading code challenges, to creating screencasts, he loves to lead. I’m excited for his future as a web developer and am excited to see where he goes.

- From Alex Navarrete: I've known Sunny since November and it has been very cool seeing how much he has improved as a software developer. In GameTime, we finally had the opportunity to pair together for the first time on a school project and I knew that it was going to be great. Sunny has the most amazing enthusiastic attitude when it comes to programming that I truly admire because it made the pairing experience amazing. I remember the day before GameTime was due we were done with basic functionality earlier than most people but continued coding until 4 AM since believed in each other's skills to really give it our 100%. Also, what I really like about Sunny is how he is able to figure out hard problems and stay calm/focused until he figures it out no matter how long it takes him. That in itself shows who he truly is, a person who never gives up no matter how hard the problem is. Thanks for being the most dopest partner anyone could've asked for and for being a good friend during my time in Turing.

- From Jon Liss: our glorious overlord sunny is magnanimous and generous and I want for nothing under his reign.

- From Matt Pindell: Sunny has the almost-magical ability to straddle the line between inordinately positive and kind, while still being shockingly direct - and I think it's absolutely amazing. He's been a huge asset to the awesome vibes within the Turing community, as well as the cohort (and let's face it - at times 1602 really needed it). I feel very fortunate to have gone through this madcap code journey with him.

- From Mark Miranda: Sunny has been one of the motivating forces moving 1602 forward. He's a light of intense and helpful feedback at Turing and always willing to help more than you ask, even if he's busy. I was glad to have him on SAB during module 4 as someone who could help me gauge interest and ways to get responses from our cohort. Sunny is a strong programmer, great person to collaborate with, and even better human being. I'm ecstatic to see what he does post Turing and where this path takes him.
