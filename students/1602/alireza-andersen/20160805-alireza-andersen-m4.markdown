### Areas of Emphasis


"There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning." *Jiddu Krishnamurti*

Finally being able to see the light at the end of the tunnel, flashbacks of Binary Search Tree and Jungle Beats slowing going away,being replaced with the anxiety of finishing school and landing my first job as a Full Stack Programmer. I came to module 4 with the hope of learning JavaScript and left with with the knowledge of knowing how valuable of a programmer I have become. Creating my first functional app in React.Native, advancing my prior applications with new features, and being able to read code that I have never even learned.

#### ScaleUp!

* [Outdoor Mobile Github](https://github.com/alirezaandersen/OutdoorMobile)

Project Description

The Goal, learn React Native in two weeks, the outcome a functional app that works with a previous app that I created in Module 3.

Outdoor Mobile is a extension of Outdoor Adventure Time. The goal is to be able to access the all information through an android app.

## Team Project

#### GameTime!

I participated in the following team project:

* [TrollyPoozleh](https://alirezaandersen.github.io/trollypoozleh/)

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

Project Description

A game of reflex and concentration , our game came from a creation of multiple interest in puzzles, Wack a Mole, and trolls. Click all the green to save the trolls but click on the wrong square and kill a pony. Good Luck!

This game is built in all JavaScript and is tested with Teaspoon Mocha!

### Feedback to Me

Ali is a passionate programmer who puts in the time and effort needed to accomplish his goals. He will tackle anything and find a creative way to figure it out even if he has never done anything like it. I appreciate his caring attitude and his excitement celebrating little accomplishments throughout the creation process. He is open to other people’s ideas and solutions and tries to understand where they are coming from. I enjoyed seeing how we both improved our ability to listen better to each others ideas and how we naturally found our roles in the team and focussed on our strength. I enjoyed creating this fun game together.  Ali will be a great asset to any creative team!  *~Claudia Kiesenhofer*

I remember the first time I met Ali, I felt like he was in my corner from the start.  He’s been a stand up guy for me, a friend, and a source of sanity in an insane seven months, basically my Turing family.  He is incredibly generous in so many ways.  There have been times when I know he is stretched thin and he has still dropped everything to help others.  His stamina and ability to work through tough spikes in the academic program, in addition to working at a paying job, has been inspirational.  I haven’t heard of a single other student being successful at this and I know for working through my first month at school what a crunch this can be.  I’ve never seen him intimidated or afraid to dive into a new concept and he puts in the time to really research something until he understands it.  It was a lot of fun working with Ali for game time, and although we had some passionate debates between the three of us, we were able to come out with some pretty stellar code we could all be proud of, a finished product that did what we set our minds to, and a mutual appreciation and respect for one another.  Ali believes strongly in what he is doing and produces some very good work.  I’m so glad I had the chance to be in his cohort and he is someone I hope to call a friend for life.  Much love to you.  Thank you for all your friendship and support! *~Kristine Foss*

### Giving Feedback

According to the Feedback application:

I have seen huge strides with *Kris* and her level of programming. You can tell that with each piece of code she writes, passion follows. *Kris* has been a huge support line for me while attending school. Her calm demeanor and positive vibe was a huge help for the days that I was stressed out with school and work. Working with *Kris* for Game Time was great, her passion in UX experience can be seen within all of her projects. She has taken her skill of interior design and has been able to create extremely amazing programs with fantastic visual effects. Her passion in ensuring client side presentation is seen within all of her work.  I am super confident that *Kris* will end up leading the industry with her amazing client details, code, and visual attention to detail. I look forward to one day being able to create such visually pleasant apps like *Kris* does. Look out for this Coder she will be set new levels for UX standards!

Working twice with *Claudia* is a great honor, to see her level of skills increase to a new level is great! The best thing about  working with *Claudia*, is her determination, JavaScript was a new language for all of us on Game Time. *Claudia* made sure that we understood the importance of testing and was determined that our project have solid code. Now that we are at the end of our school, I am super happy to know that *Claudia* will end up being a fantastic programmer and have a great career where I hope that one day in the future we can code again. *Claudia* you are determined, passionate and amazingly skilled when it comes to producing great code. You truly are a software engineer  and I wish you the best! I know you will be very successful in this career field and am super glad I got to do my last group project with you.

# Instructor Results

# Portfolio Rubric

Your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 4: Student demonstrates excellent growth by not only achieving satisfactory
evaluations for each project but also pushing their learning beyond expectations.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.


* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.


* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.


## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 4: Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback
to shape their own character and behavior.

Notes: You did a great job of juggling responsibilities, staying focused.
