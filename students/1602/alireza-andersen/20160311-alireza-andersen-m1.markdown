# Alireza Jace Andersen - M1.2 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

"A failure is not always a mistake; it may simply be the best one can do under the circumstances. The real mistake is to stop trying." *B.F Skinner*

Failing the first time around was a huge disappointment. But *B.F Skinner* makes a great point. Giving up and walking away would have been my biggest disappointment. I came into this module with a different approach. Maximize my strengths in what I have learned from and focus on my weaknesses.

I am glad that I repeated! Worried about conceptually learning something new, went out the door by the 3rd week. I guess in a accelerated program its always hard to retain everything taught in such a short time.

I stated in my last Portfolio that I know the educators want me to be successful and I have put my entire faith and career in their hands. I do believe by them making me repeat, was a good course and I am grateful, since it has made me a stronger programmer. I look forward to continuing this program, obtaining this knowledge, and becoming a proud alumni of Turing School of Software and Design.

I like to end things with good quotes, I found this the first day of Module 1.2 and I think it speaks very highly of all students who have repeated. “Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again. This time more intelligently.”
*Henry Ford*

### Attendance

For module 1.2, I once again attended all days, every day, even the days that there were no school. I have never missed a day nor have I been late to class.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### MasterMind

* [MasterMindGitHub URL](https://github.com/alirezaandersen/MasterMind-.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

A classic game of memory and pattern concepts. I did this game within 3 days. Created a automated interaction game using REPL interface.

It was reviewed by Nate with the following feedback:

Discuss testing options, and the use module versus classes

#### Binary Search Tree

* [Binary Search Tree GitHub URL](https://github.com/alirezaandersen/Binary-Search-Tree.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown)

Project Description  

In this 3-day project I implemented a Binary Search Tree with recursion.

Evaluated by Horace with the following results:

* Speechless from such great code! (still waiting for feedback)


* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic Into Components: 3
* Ruby Syntax: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3


#### NightWriter

* [NightWriter GitHub URL](https://github.com/alirezaandersen/NightWriter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

Project Description  

 In this seven-day project where the goal was to implement a program that would generate Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse. This was the most rewarding project I have done thus far. I was able to really use my knowledge and benefit of repeating module one. My goal on this project was two parts, create the project with the most single responsibility methods and classes, and secondly try to perfect ruby Syntax. I was able to maximize new refactoring techniques to perfect the Syntax from my mentor and learned new shortcuts that otherwise would have never known existed. I didn't expect it to have a negative impact on my evaluation for using my mentor as this resource.

Evaluated by Nate with the following results:

* Worried about drift between grades and knowledge. Have mentors help you write more code, and less showing you their solutions


* Functional Expectations: 3
* Ruby Syntax: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Breaking Logic Into Components: 4

## Team

### Projects

### http-yeah-you-know-me

I participated in the following team projects:

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alirezaandersen/http-you-know-me-2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

In this 4 day project my partner Christine Gamble and I created basic http server with some real live data and a interactive puzzle game. As my third pairing project. I felt that my team member and I were on pair throughout the entire project. Our dedication and passion is shown throughout our work and I am very proud of our grades - the long Hours paid-off!

Evaluated by Mike with the following results:

* Application works, through iteration five.
* 37 tests
* Pull conditions out to methods returning booleans to increase readability
* Some repetition of code.


* Ruby Syntax: 3
* Breaking Logic Into Components: 3
* Overall Functionality: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Enumerable & Collections: 3

### HeadCount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JaredRoth/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

In this 10-day project my partner Jared Roth and I constructed a database from CSV files containing state and district education statistics. The biggest challenge was being able to create multiple load paths and massage the format of data to create statistics.I am super proud of our grades.

Evaluated by Horace with the following results:

* Passes spec harness through i5 -- solid 3 on completion
* Overall successful in managing data flow and processing through the repos
* In general strong style around how we're handling things; only a few quibbles around naming, method division, etc
* enums, etc are pretty string; using some group by especially; maybe think about reduce instead of each with object
* test coverage and breadth are both great; still would like to see more usage of more curated / specific data and attacking the tests
at lower levels


* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 4
* Code Sanitation: 4

### Berners Lee Posse

* The last Module, our posse would hardly meet I think only once or twice throughout the entire module. Nate, David, and I decided to change that with the next cohort. Now we meet everyday. And not only work together on the challenges but have been able to reunite our Posse together which has now allowed us to Leading the Cup! I see us keeping this momentum for here on out.

* My favorite challenge out of our 5 was the CodeBreaker as Enigma was one of my favorite and hardest projects Nate, David, and I were able to give more feed back since the project was fresh in our minds still. With the knowledge of the later module members we turn in a great code. Our challenges are as follows

### Feedback to Me

"Working with Ali is incredible.  He’s got such a depth of understanding for programming and a true passion for it.  He goes the extra mile to cover edge cases and extensions.  His drive and tenacity are really inspiring.  I also see an insatiable thirst for knowledge and I know his programming skills will continue to grow exponentially.  In addition to being tireless and willing to drag himself through days on end of no sleep to complete a project to it’s full extension, he is incredibly giving.  He is selfless and generous and even in the depth of his own project deadline, at the eleventh hour, he is willing to jump in and rescue others who are struggling.  He’s a wonderful friend and class mate.  Ali is also a social ambassador for our cohort, and he naturally draws people together.  It’s a privilege to be  in Ali’s glowing presence and I enjoy anything from grabbing a drink to digging through and debugging code along with him.  He will make a great addition to any workplace." - Kris Foss

"Ali was a great person to pair with for my first partner project.  We worked together on http-yeah-you-know-me.  He is incredibly driven and will do whatever it takes to get the project done.  I thought we communicated openly from the very beginning, and this allowed us to be successful with the project.  Ali thinks very logically and was able to envision a clear setup for all of the different classes and how they should work together. During the project there were a couple of times when we made problems more complicated then they had to be, and this caused us to lose time. If we had taken a step back from the problem and looked at the bigger picture we might have saved some time. Overall though, Ali’s logical thinking and determination will ensure success in the future." Christine Gamble


"Ali has a wealth of insights and and experience with different projects and exercises. I was feeling insecure and he gave me concrete insights and recommendations about other exercises and resources I could use to practice skills. Ali pushes himself to a very high level of expectation. His passion and ambition are his strengths and I know he will channel all his fire into an amazing career as a developer." - Deborah Hamel


" I am very impressed with Ali’s determination to learn and understand the classwork.  I noticed immediately that his work ethics are the top in the class.  He holds himself to a higher standard than others and is not satisfied until he meets his own expectations.  If he doesn’t know how to do something he will use every resource to find out.  From calling on mentors, peers, or his own friends, his drive to find an answer has no end.  I know that Ali will become a top programmer because his commitment to learn and his attitude to be the master of his craft.  He has a great attitude and works hard to be the best.   I enjoyed paring with Ali and look forward to working with him in the future." - Matt DesMarteau

### Giving Feedback

According to the Feedback application:


Kris,

Relaxation and meditation, with a sense of logic and clarity is the best way to describe Kris. I had the opportunity to pair with her throughout Module 1 and all I can say is WOW! Her approach to the projects and challenges are both logical and methodical, she clearly understands the functionality of concepts needed to be a great programmer, even her notes are clearer then the instructors lectures.  She's also a really cool person who makes you always feel relax when she’s around as well as guilty since she is so healthy and the yoga thing is really cool too. I know that Kris will be a very successful programmer and make a huge impact in the tech world!

Deborah,

I cant say enough good things about Deborah to explain how valuable she is to Turing, my knowledge and learning, as well as the Tech world. Have the honor of working with Deborah between the last 2 modules has been great! She has been one of my main supporters during this long haul of Module 1. But more impressively is how knowledgeable she has become, Deborah already had a great wealth of knowledge before, but now. She is a million times stronger and unstoppable! She has helped me numerous times to solve speed bumps that I reach. I know that Deborah will leave a positive mark in the Turing culture as well as in the tech world!

Christine,

I had the opportunity to pair with Christine for http-yeah-you-know-me. As this being my third pair project, I wasn’t as nervous as I was the last time around. Christine took all the nervousness that I had a way. She is extremely passionate about learning code and it shows with her logic solving. She understands that programming does not have a specific one way of doing things. This was super valuable during our pairing project and allowed us to approach problems in different ways. I know she will end up being a great programmer and I look forward to her success!
