# Matt Pindell - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### My Mission
Get comfortable with Rails and hopefully step up my side-hustle game (by getting familiar with Javascript + Rust).

### End of Module Diagnostic

Assessed By: Brenna Martenson

#### Notes

- 6 Examples, 1 Failure (display hours functionality)
- In service should pull api key and format into methods
- Well written commit messages
- Looks like developer was close to all tests passing aside from formatting issues
- Good work scoping feature tests to html elements
- Would like to see model testing and more robust testing for delete action in controller (ie items created/deleted/counted)
- Ideally view would only handle one instance variable from the controller, everything else in a model or presenter

##### Scores:

* Ruby Style: __3__
* Rails Syntax & API: __3__
* Testing: __3__
* Progression/Completion: __3__
* Workflow: __4__

### Attendance

I left one class early due to sickness.

## Work

### Team Projects

Below is a list of all of my paired projects and assessment scores.

#### ClarkeBase

Insanely rewarding and enjoyable - most I've ever felt like a 'real' developer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jdliss/clarkebase)

Team: Jon Liss, Jon Bernesser

Assessed By: Nate Allen

##### Notes:

* ClarkeCoin forever
* Use partials for ujs (.js.erb)
* There's still some logic that can be pushed out of controllers, but most controllers look good
* Talked about some lesser used code organization (don't forget about the lib folder)
* Tests look like they provide good value
* Javascript is tabbed well. Good on you. Oh, and pretty well organized as JS goes.

##### Scores:

* Completion: __3__
* Organization: __4__
* Test-Driven Development: __3__
* Code Quality: __3__
* User Experience: __3__
* Performance: __4__

#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/pindell-matt/rails_engine)

Assessed By: Josh Mejia

##### Notes:

- 3 failing specs. Really solid ActiveRecord. Controllers are super clean and all logic is delegated to the model layer. Some formatting happening in the model that should be handled in a serializer.

##### Scores:

* Completion: __3__
* Test-Driven Development: __3+__
* Code Quality: __4__
* API Design: __4__
* Queries: __4__

### Non-Evaluated Projects

#### Rails Mini Project

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* __For Marina Corona (1602)__ - "Marina, your focus on workflow is awesome and undeniably an asset to any team you’re own. It helped keep us on a more concrete course of action, which is what we needed - especially when we hit our first bout of turbulence. I think you said as much yourself, but it would be better to voice your concerns about workflow issues earlier, and to not bottle up your thoughts about the direction the team should head in / the way we should distribute responsibilities and work. At the end of the day (and the end of my illness) I was super stoked with what you and Admir put together while I was a walking corpse - you single-handedly made the extension work - so keep crushing it!"

* __For Admir Dragonovic (1602)__ - "Admir, your willingness to tackle different cards and experiment with new things (the dreaded AJAX / internal APIs) was awesome kept me stoked to work on the Pivot. And while we went down that rabbit hole way too early, it was fun working on it with you. I can only suggest that you try not to get discouraged / frustrated when things break and explode (ironic for me to say, considering my meltdown with RSpec haha - but it’s something we can both work on, it seems) because it’s going to happen - and usually the fastest progress is made when you dispassionately focus on finding a solution. Overall, you and Marina carried our team in the home stretch while I was dead, and I’m glad y’all crushed it!"

### Being a Community Member

* __From Marina Corona (1602)__ - "Matt worked very hard on the project. So hard, in fact, that he got sick from the countless hours working. I can definitely attest to his strong work ethic. I think my biggest piece of feedback for Matt would be to take on a small step and worry about getting it to basic functionality before taking on something else. Styling, edge cases, adding ajax or specific functionality is great, but it shouldn't be the first concern. I think that the mindset to try to tackle a lot at once, pushed us back because we were left waiting for a specific thing to get done and couldn't move forward. It also was so complex that no one else could problem solve or write tests for it, which put the team into a tough spot when he was out the second week because of illness."

* __From Admir Dragonovic (1602)__ - "Matt working with you was great. The positivity and enthusiasm you brought to the pivot was what put our group back on track after a challenging start. I am really impressed with your ability to dive into new problems. I feel that you are very well rounded not only in your technical skills but also as a person/teammate. I know your passion for learning will take you far in your career but do not let the excitement of learning something distract you from the task at hand. Hopefully one day I will get to work with you on another project because I really value and enjoy what you bring to a group."

### Playing a Part

* Served as a Pre-Work Guide for mod 1603, 1605, and 1606
* Golick Posse Memeber - provide support in learning new low-level languages (Rust)
* Created 'Embedding Rust Within Ruby using FFI' screencast
* Volunteered / presented 'Embedding Rust Within Ruby using FFI' on Friday Lightning Talk

## Review

# Portfolio Rubric

Your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

3

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

3

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

3

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

3

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

Notes:

* excited about rails
* excited about new posse structure
* making screencast on rust + ruby
* like pick & choose vibe of M2
* group work went well - very different between 3 and 4 person groups
* would like to see more actionable feedback given to peers
* liked buddy system for M1 (paired with Beth Secor)


OUTCOME:

Pass! :)
