# Matt Pindell - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### My Mission

I want to build a strong foundation in Ruby Fundamentals, improve my workflow (faster typing, reduced mouse usage, tools optimized), and develop more confidence in high-pressure coding situations.

## Work

### Team Projects

Below is a list of all of my paired projects and assessment scores.

#### HeadCount

Last go-around, I completed Black Thursday - so I wanted to do a different project while repeating. Luckily, it's also the assignment that Chris wanted to do, so things worked out!

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/seeker105/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)
* [Team DTR](https://github.com/seeker105/headcount/blob/master/headcount_dtr_memo.md)

Pair: Christopher Soden

Assessed By: Nate Allen

##### Notes:

* Data manager got out of control. Might need some modules, or maybe push responsibility to other classes, existing or not
* Use mock data. Gonna take some setup time, but better
* Class variables are not preferable, is there another way to do this? Experiment with 'nil protector'
* Good test coverage
* Using lots of different ruby tools at your disposal. Good work.

##### Scores:

* Functional Expectations: __3__
* Test-Driven Development: __4__
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: __3__
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: __4__
* Enumerable & Collections: __3__
* Code Sanitation: __4__

#### Hyde

Having completed HTTP-Yeah-You-Know-Me last module, I wanted to try the new alternate option, Hyde. It was valuable to dip my toes into HTML / CSS - and I especially liked using backticks to handle all of our integration tests.

### Individual Projects

Below is a breakdown of all the Individual Projects I completed this module, along with the notes and scores I received.

#### Complete Me

This was the final Echo project, and I definitely struggled with it the most - particularly the Trie structure - as well as just inherently being burnt out after the back to back project assignments. For those reasons, it was also the most satisfying to _complete_ (drum snare).

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/pindell-matt/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

Assessed by: Horace Williams

##### Notes

* Lots of tests - seem to have spent a lot of time on these
* Implementation fairly clear; does follow the algorithm closely
* have a few failing tests on master that need to get cleaned up
* Some of the divisions of methods feel a little arbitrary -- the naming
especially indicates this.
* Mostly want to keep focusing making these divisions more deliberately
and naming them accordingly
* Testing -- provisional 3 assuming we clean up the failing tests for node
* Encapsulation is probably the weaker point of this -- just keep experimenting
with different ways to divide these structures

##### Scores:

* Functional Expectations: __3__
* Test-Driven Development: __3__
* Breaking Logic into Components: __3__
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: __3__
* Enumerable & Collections: __3__

#### Sorting Suite

I was very excited to delve into the Sorting Suite assignment and get some Computer Science concepts under my belt. The benchmarking extensions were also hugely helpful in driving home the differences between the algorithms.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/pindell-matt/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

Assessed by: Nate Allen

##### Scores:

* Overall Functionality: __4__
* Test-Driven Development: __4__
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: __3__
* Organization: __4__

#### Binary Search Tree

Binary Search Tree marked the first time that I felt as though I actually knew what I was doing / knew how to program. It was a huge confidence boost to complete this project, and it was great to experience this after working on Linked Lists last time around.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/pindell-matt/binary-search-tree)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown)

Assessed by: Horace Williams

##### Notes

* Good project with 2 extra methods added in
* Effectively delegates more responsibilities to the Node class to keep each recursive process more concise
* At the small level methods are generally short, concise, easy to read
* Only structural quibble is with storing node depth in the nodes -- ideally would calculate this information dynamically from the node's position in
the tree

##### Scores:

* Overall Functionality: __4__
* Test-Driven Development: __3__
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: __4__
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: __3__
* Looping *or* Recursion: __3__

#### Mastermind

Mastermind was a great intro to Echo, it was great to have a slightly longer amount of time in order to really dig into the project / expectations.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/pindell-matt/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

Assessed by: Horace Williams

##### Notes:

* Interface is clean; like the colors (extension woot)
* Executable file with shebang is cool; pull implementation out
of it so the executable is just an interface into the rest of the code
* Enums are well-used and concise
* Switching comfortably between string and enumerable constructs
* Like the experimentation with modules and monkey-patching; talked about
reasons why these may not necessarily be the best solution in the way they're
being used
* Looked at a couple examples where we could use another dedicated object rather
than leaving things in the main mastermind class
* Enums are looking ok but we can still use them to further dissect the problem by
combining multiple enums to solve smaller portions of our problem ("pipelining")

##### Scores:

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: __4__
* Enumerable & Collections: __3__
* REPL Interface and Game Functionality: __4__
* Breaking Logic into Components: __3__

## Community

### Posse Challenges

The challenge that employed Procs was far and away the coolest one - I'm still unsure of when and where I'll have the chance to use them next - but it's just wild to recreate enums in that way. I think the Posse Challenges have succeeded wildly in terms of brining the individual posses together, but I do think that the requirements and difficulty still need to be dialed in - in order for the Posse experience to be rewarding for all involved.

### Giving Feedback

"Kami knows what she's doing - she only needs to vocalize her thought process and not apologize for where her gut takes her. I could have definitely done a better job at giving hints of where to go (and been less cryptic in general), but Kami's logic was 100% sound. Once she can clearly and confidently break down her reactions to hiccups / bumps in the code, she'll be crushing it 24/7." - **Feedback for Kami Boers (1602)**

"Working with Sal was, by far, the most stress-free and enjoyable programming I’ve ever experienced at Turing. Between his fantastic communication skills, stellar programming skills, and inherently positive nature - we chomped through each and every challenge with alarming ease. We just talked things out - found a solution, and moved on to the next coding adventure - it was the zenith of pair-programming. I actually became paranoid towards the end because we hadn’t hit any explosive plot twists in the code, it was almost TOO straightforward. The only possible adjustment that I can see would be for Sal to become a dash more assertive on topics he has previous experience in. He was much more knowledgeable in terms of HTML/CSS/SASS but seemed to downplay that aspect when we hit those portions of the project." - **Feedback for Sal Espinosa (1602)**

### Being a Community Member

"I really enjoyed working with Matt on the Robot tests. Matt is super knowledgable and is excellent at facilitating understanding for his partner without coding for them. His approach helped me to slow me down and pay attention to my actions rather than rushing ahead and causing additional errors. I feel that I have a more thorough understanding of testing that will come in handy for future projects. Matt is a natural, positive teacher and could easily develop that skill to benefit himself and the Turing community." - **Kami Boers (1602)**

"I'm a better programmer for working with Matt P. Let's talk about why:
* First and format his red/green/refactor cycle is super strong. Especially the refactor portion. I learned that refactoring isn't the kind of thing that you do "at the end," but instead a constant part of the process.
* He has a commitment to writing clean, beautiful code. He'll apologize for being a stickler about making '=' line up, but the code is easier to read because of it.
* He's great at breaking problems down into parts that make sense, and does a really great job of naming methods, variables, etc., which again leads to readable code and helps make it easier to go back and read code when refactoring/revising.
* His work ethic is strong, and he's dedicated to putting in the work to get things done.

The one thing I could think of that might benefit Matt in the future would be to not hesitate to check the internet for code samples when it seems like there might be an easy way to do something. It sounds like a weird thing, and there's definitely a balance to be had (I don't think anyone wants to go to the internet for everything), but I think I was more willing to fire up a google session to find some tips on how to do something." - **Sal Espinosa (1602)**

### Playing a Part

I was able to attend two Imposter Lunches and Nate's After-school Wordpress Talk.

## Review

develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.


* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 4: Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback
to shape their own character and behavior.
