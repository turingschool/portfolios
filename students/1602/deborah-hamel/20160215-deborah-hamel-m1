# Deborah Hamel - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

Coming into this module I wanted to improve my Ruby skills and workflow and become more confident with programming.

### End of Module Assessment

* **Ruby Syntax & API**:3
* **Ruby Style**: 3
* **Testing**: 3
* **Workflow**: 3
* **Collaboration**: 4

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of a tardy to morning class.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### JungleBeats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/deborahleehamel/junglebeats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

In this project I implemented a linked list. It was
evaluated by Mike with the following results:

Notes:
linked list 17 runs, 26 assertions
node - 5 runs 8 assertions
jb - 13 runs, 15 assertions
append and prepend methods are in linked list
calculating count - really good!
Some unnecessary variable assignment
Voice and rate extension completed.

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping *or* Recursion: 4

#### NightWriter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/deborahleehamel/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](http://github.com/turingschool/challenges/robodoku.markdown)


* Overall Functionality: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thompickett/http_yeah)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

Notes:

completed iteration 0-4, does not follow the spec fully but has all functionality included
very good tests, easy to read, well organized. Could use some DRYing up in terms of lvars and shared data
overall very nice project, well factored and mostly easy to read.
there's opportunity to DRY up some functionality in modules.

* Overall Functionality: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3


### Instructor Pairing Feedback
###Nate Allen
- You struggle to ask yourself what feedback you need when
  you're stuck. When you see an error, your response is to
  just play around. When you're stuck, ask yourself what
  information you're missing, and how you can get it.

- You're good at speaking technically. You know your way
  around ruby and it's syntax, and you're able to communicate
  about programming.


### Posse challenges
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amaxwellblair/posse_challenges)

Highlights for me:
* Working through writing and committing a FlagParser feature on
  collegescorecard challenge gave me confidence
* Collaborating with people from different modules was fun and an opportunity
  for immediate feedback
* Friday morning code evals were learning events, took away lots of new
  understanding.


### Feedback to Me
###Josh Washke
Deb is an amazing person to work with and a good friend. We were paired up on
Black Thursday and she was very clear about her goals for the project and how
she wanted to accomplish it. She helped me improve my pairing skills and was
an asset at all levels of the project from testing to implementatin to pull
requests. My only advice for Deb is that she needs to be more confident in her
ability. She is a strong programmer and good problem solver who can do great
work, but she seems to have trouble believing it. I am happy to work with Deb
in the future and hope that the more projects she accomplishes the more she
will realize she is a strong competent programmer.

###Jeff Ruane
I've really enjoyed pairing with you over the course of this module. First
of all, you're super easy to work with, it's been a pleasure. I think you have
really good instincts, and, just overall, you're a good developer. I've never
seen you really stuck and stressed out. For the most part, you've come into
our meetings with working code already written, and good code at that, and
just questions about more robust testing and maybe some refactoring. That's
super impressive, you've just been killing it this module. If I could suggest
one thing to work on, and this is applicable to a lot of people, myself
included, is just your confidence. You know what you're doing, and you
should believe it. I only mention that because you seemed uncharacteristically
stressed out last week trying to prepare for your assessment. Just go in
there and do your thing and you'll do great.

###Thomas Pickett
Deb stayed very organized and meticulous about naming objects in our
code and and our workflow as well. Our workflow being branch
names, and commit messages, and pull requests. I really
appreciated that as itâ€™s something I struggle with, and it
kept our project nice and tidy. She also kept an eye out for
edge cases and refactoring as we went along so we had less
cleanup at the end.

Deb mostly seems to struggle with confidence, but she knows
this already. When Deb is more confident she stays
more engaged, and gives more input. As a team we could work
more on creating an environment where she feels comfortable contributing.

###Ali Andersen
I cant say enough good things about Deborah to explain how valuable she is to
Turing, my knowledge and learning, as well as the Tech world. Have the honor
of working with Deborah between the last 2 modules has been great! She has
been one of my main supporters during this long haul of Module 1. But more
impressively is how knowledgeable she has become, Deborah already had a great
wealth of knowledge before, but now. She is a million times stronger and
unstoppable! She has helped me numerous times to solve speed bumps that I
reach. I know that Deborah will leave a positive mark in the Turing culture
as well as in the tech world!

### Emily Blanchard
Deb has a wonderfully positive attitude, even when the task at hand is
difficult for two beginners. As a team, we did not give up, but could have
focused more on the task at hand. Perhaps we should have started the entire
thing over again from scratch to see how much we both actually knew.


### Emily McClung
Debra with nothing but helpful. She had very sound advice and was very
patient with my lack of expertise.I did  a less than perfect job listening
while she was explaining. But that was not her fault , that was mine.
I think Debra is better than she think she is and I believe she definitely
can be a help to me in the future.she was a very good mentor. And I would
feel comfortable going to her for help anytime. Working with her was a pleasure.
