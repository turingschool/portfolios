Myself and two others re-implemented an old Atari game, Warlords. It is basically a four player pong/breakout. We ended up creating two versions: one for local "split screen" multiplayer (it's just one screen) and one that utilized websockets to for online multiplayer. My primary areas of focus were hand-rolling the majority of the collision detection as well as establishing beginning and end of game flow.

#### Scale-Up - LookingForMe Backend

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor/tree/master)

I really enjoyed a lot about Scale Up, from the PR review to the work patterns that are more reflective of real life. I was the backend team leader, and therefor had the immense responsibility of one other person who was pretty self-sufficient. My main contributions were: an additional API endpoint for the frontend team, the addition of error tracking via slack for the app in production, and an update to various aspects of the documentation.

  Joining and Existing Project

  I think I'm going to add this blog post to the pre-work readings to be done if people accept this project. It's a good perspective.

1. Error Reporting

  Don't feel 'stupid'! We should talk most about API status codes as instructors!

  I'd recommend including a link to the place in the repo where you added the code. Potentially a screenshot of the slack channel in motion.

1. General

  Thanks for adding some more deets to the research spike issue - and for being open to researching that as a final move on the project. The rails wasn't the most glorious of places to be working during this section of LookingFor - since the front end was refactoring and therefor didn't have as many urgent needs - but setting up the errors channel is super helpful for me personally. So all glory to the errors channel.

### Giving Feedback

* Drew Thompson
>Coming in to GameTime, Drew knew he wanted to work behind the scenes. This clarity of desire and purpose really helped form the group dynamic as we divided our efforts. The flip side of that was that we (as an entire group) tended to work very independently. This became a problem towards the end as our work became more complex and we hadn't established effective communication up to that point. Although poor communication was an issue for everyone on the team and not any one member, it could be something for Drew to work on.

* Josh Washke
>I like working with Josh. GameTime being our second project together, I knew before starting that he deserved the title of GameTime prom queen with his rapid and thorough understanding of problems and how to solve them. Josh is particularly good at getting up to speed with others' janky-ass code and knowing what's going wrong or how to make it better. My only comment on this would be that sometimes a simple "why did/didn't you do it this way?" can occasionally come across as condescending. So just a word of caution regarding tone in situations like that.

### Receiving Feedback

* Drew Thompson
>Gametime was the first time I worked with Jared on a project.  Overall he was great to work with.  He regularly asked for advice on different aspects and resources that we may have for certain parts of the game.  He worked tirelessly to perfect collision detection in the game, re-implementing it several times until he was happy with the result.  He also took the initiative to do some final styling and making the game setup correct.  In the end we had a badass game that wouldnâ€™t have been nearly the success without his dedication.

* Josh Washke
>It was cool getting to work with you again since Little Shop. Talking to you coming into Mod 4 you seemed to have pretty low confidence in your ability and where you were at. Working with you in Gametime I definitely don't think you have anything to worry about. You implemented a large amount of the difficult logic by yourself and never hesitated in tackling a difficult problem. The best feedback I can give you is to communicate with the group more, we had some trouble getting everything together at the end and more communication throughout the process would have smoothed out a lot of those issues. But that was an issue with the entire group as a whole and not just you. Overall I'm excited to see what you do next and a little sad to see you go back home Friday. I'm happy to work with you again in the future and will hit you up next time I'm in SoCal.
