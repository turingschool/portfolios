### Goals
My goals beginning the third module again was to make sure that the effort and time I'm putting in is being used in an efficient way. I noticed the first time I tried out module three I was constantly finding myself in a rabbit's hole where I'll have no answer at the end of it. I realized that the time it would take for me to implement some features would be longer than usual. So, I came up with solutions by making sure I would give myself a certain time to complete as much as I can for the tasks I'll give myself. I figured that by timing myself I'd be able to have some data to check how I progressed throughout the weeks in the module. So far, it has been working and I'm happy with the progress I've made.

### End of Module Assessment

Notes
- Very thorough workflow with helpful documentation on next steps
- Don't see store name on store show page
- Good work on testing - 1 failing due to incorrect data coming in but developer notes direction of next steps
- Like the extra implementation of factory girl and organized tests on every level
- 1 Failing test (data discrepancy)
- Showed effort on design (not required)
- Could DRY out your service by setting common params in initialize
- Progression/Completion shows you know what you're doing and know where you want to go but needed more time to implement final refactored functionality

## Community

### Giving Feedback
"Claudia: Working with you throughout The Pivot was full of many highs and lows. You did a very good job in figuring out how to get the Favorite's functionality to work with our project and in making sure to communicate with Ali when necessary. Something that I'd love for you to work on is to try and keep your stress levels low even when experiencing something like the pivot in the future. For example, I noticed that when something bad will happen (merge conflicts, css not loading on heroku, etc.) you'd get very stressed out and anxious in moments where it won't help the team figure out the solution. I'd like for you to also remember to take your breaks when you find yourself in stressful moments by taking a walk outside or something that'll help out clear the mind from the bad vibes. Thanks for being an amazing team member."

"Ling: Working with you was pretty cool since we got along very well when it came time for us to pair together. I like how open you were with all of us by keeping us in check whenever the conversation was going on a tangent by saying, "this isn't top priority at the moment." We really needed someone to remind us all the time about that because the team itself was already in a huge tangent to begin with. I also liked how even when moments were stressful you were able to control yourself in times where we needed to just come to a conclusion and come up with something to implement on the project. I'd love for you to bring that "project manager" side of you next time you find yourself in a group situation because it was very valuable. Your say in situations were always important because it made the whole team take a step back and realize what truly was top priority. Thanks for being an amazing team member."

"Ali: I've heard stories prior to The Pivot where working with you was a hassle due to how opinionated you are in many things. This was notable throughout our time working as a team together. We even ended up arguing over a feature you wanted when the team was opposed to it even though you said it will make the site more ""realistic."" That same feature is what also made it even more difficult to progress even further with what we could've done when finishing up our project.
I didn't like how you were not open to ways of doing technical stuff when the team and I told you critical implementations that had to be done (namespacing, single responsibility controllers, etc.). You need to be more open to critical feedback and not find rebuttals by saying stuff like, "this is the way the instructors taught the lesson thus this is why I made it this way."
No, things do not work out that way. That's the equivalent of writing something like this "3 + 3 + 3 + 3" when you know you can express the exact thing and even better by writing this "3 * 4". But I can say this though, I love how you question everything and how you're always open for a discussion no matter how bad your odds of winning the debate is. That's something that I will keep in mind on doing when the time is right. Thanks for teaching me that."

"Sal: Dude working with your on this Trelora project was by far one of the coolest team projects I've ever had throughout my time in Turing. I can't thank you enough for being open to letting me partner up with you because I really did not have anything planned out with how I was going to do this final project for the model. I got to say, you are very damn good when it comes to pushing forward on things that seem really hard. I like how you were always able to keep a positive mindset throughout your time trouble shooting too. It makes me reflect on how I should approach bugs with that mindset as well. Thanks for making history with me on delivering our product to a real client! You can't even imagine how hyped I am with the way how everything turned out that I just really want to show this off to everyone I know. - Alex Navarrete"

### Being a Community Member
"Alex, you are very knowledgeable and willing to share information and resources with the team. The styling you did for the views were fantastic and I am grateful for having paired with you to work on some of them to up my own game. You are very self-aware and proactive about improving your work flow. Something that may be helpful to recognize when under a time crunch is that the tendency to get caught up on what is going wrong big picture wise may not be helping the cause at the moment. I'm proud that we managed to push through the mini hackathon together the day before the deadline." - Ling Tran

"This was a hard project and I am happy with what we turned in given the difficulties we dealt with. I know that you were very upset with the code quality the evening before the due date. I understand the pressure you felt and I am impressed that you could sacrifice the good grade on code and put all effort in everything else that had to happen in order to ship a functioning product. I appreciate that you were open to fill in whatever was needed. I know you didn't enjoy working with materialize but you did it anyway and you did such a great job styling our site. I really enjoyed debugging with you. Your calm and analytical way of tackling a problem created such a great space for understanding and figuring out where the issue was. It taught me a lot. You know so much and I wish you would have shared that a bit more even though it wasn't easy to get heard. I wish you could keep a positive spirit a bit more when things get difficult. You have so many coding skills, knowledge and great ideas to share but when you get in the mode of "everything will go bad" a lot of your ability is unused. I am glad you could switch out of this mode quickly, especially the last evening of the pivot. Your commitment to a high quality project outcome and your caring and supportive attitude is very inspiring and makes working with you really enjoyable." - Claudia

"Alex, your knowledge definitely helped out the team with the pivot this time. I am impressed with how quickly you would catch on. And how quickly your became a team player.  My only feedback to you is, when a team discusses an approach it is not necessary an argument or debate, its a discussion. Remember our first day, you had a very negative approach with the team but after our team discussion you realize how much we needed your skills to get through our project and you brought on the knowledge you gained from already going through Mod 3 once. You have a great future ahead of you and I know you will be very successful in this industry." - Ali

"Alex! You were one of the first people I met at Turing, and it was great to finally work with you after all this time. It’s funny to try to think of feedback because in a weird way I feel like we balanced each other out really well. I like that you’re committed to following rails conventions. It’s going to serve you well in the future. I know that it’s the kind of thing where if you do it right now, then you’ll be doing a favor to Alex of the future who three months from now is looking at an app trying to remember what it does and where everything is. Pairing with you I realized that my approach is pretty often to get something working without worrying how ugly it is. I think my advice to you would be to know that in the future if you’re paired with someone else who’s also a stickler for convention to not be afraid to be the guy who pushes a little outside the boundaries as long as you both commit to reel it back in and clean everything up. The right path is probably somewhere in the middle. Ultimately I have to say that I’m pretty psyched with how this project ended up, and already pretty much determined to swap it in on my resume. This is the first time that I actually feel like I have something I can show off."- Sal Espinosa
