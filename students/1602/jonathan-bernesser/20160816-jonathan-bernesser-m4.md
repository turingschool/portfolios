### Feedback to Me

  * JLISS/Game-Time

    "I was genuinely surprised when you asked me if I wanted to do Game Time in Java.  It was a huge risk, and you had no experience with anything lower level than Ruby.  It was also pretty cool to see that you were confident enough in my skills to ask me to go on this Java adventure with you, knowing I had no Java experience too.  The whole experience was great and I'm really happy with how the game turned out.  It was actually a big throwback to mod 1. Working together in a language neither of us knew, you with no experience, me with something kinda similar.  Then throughout the whole project you picked up the language and the concepts incredibly quick and made the same contributions that I did, even though I had more experience with that style of coding.  In my mind you actually carried the project initially, figuring out the canvas and the frame stuff faster than me, springboarding us into a successful project.  Your research and interaction with Jake was also on point.  As always it was a pleasure working with you, and I hope we can do it more in the future."

    "Jon was a welcome addition to the Roots project. He enthusiastically jumped into a codebase that utilized novel patterns, and he seemed to catch on quickly. His styling work was very much appreciated. One thing that I would recommend to him is to actively ask for tasks he's interested in. Since he has a good styling eye, I had assumed that he was more interested in front-end development, but in talking to him, I realized that was more my perception than actually the case. I am really appreciative for his work on the Roots project, and look forward to seeing his skills grow as he moves on from Turing."
