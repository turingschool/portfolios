### Feedback to Me

Feedback For You:
  * Jon! You were great throughout this project, and I think the end quality is directly attributable to how hard you worked and the standards you kept. I was consistently impressed with your willingness to try something new, your ability to pick it up, and the dedication to see it through. I don't feel like I have to tell you to keep doing that. I don't think anyone could stop you, which is fantastic. I would also say that you're probably the reason that we started to push out and work on things by ourselves, which was also pretty fantastic. It was good to get that time under my belt, and great to see how things came together even as we worked on them separately. I don't think it'll come as any surprise that the one piece of feedback I can give is to try to get used to working with people who might still be working through things that you already know. I'm positive you'll land at a place with people with strong skills that you can count on, but I'm also fairly confident that not too much time will pass before you'll be moving up the ladder and mentoring some junior devs. Try to be patient with them. Sappy as hell, but I can't wait to see the work that you start cranking out. It's going to be good stuff. - **Sal Espinosa**

  * Jon is clearly a strong programmer and has a fast workflow. He was able to research and tackle new features which gave our project several extensions. I think Jon would benefit himself and his future teams by actively pursuing collaboration and communicating his thoughts and process. A lot of the features were cranked out without much discussion or consultation with the rest of the group, at least Chris and I. I found myself continually making adjustments to my pull requests without understanding how such changes were significant in regards to the integration of the whole project. This was frustrating at times, and decreased my motivation to invest in the project--it did not seem like a collaborative effort. That being said, I think Jon will be a great programmer, and will only get better as he improves his collaborative abilities. - **Chad Ellison**

  * "Jon, you did an excellent job of taking the lead and coordinating the project. Your detailed knowledge of the original Little Shop project was a huge boost to our progress.
  As a group, I think we did a great job of being able to split up and still communicate and coordinate our individual progress." - **Chris Soden**

### Feedback I Gave

  * Sal Espinosa:   Sal, man, you are a joy to work with. Even when things get heated and I get pissed off from...something, you always were able to calm things and actually allow the group to move forward. It helped that we were also on the same page  for most of the project. I enjoyed how you asked what I wanted to work because you knew I wasn't having fun. I felt comfortable taking risks because I knew you would back me up. It was awesome I could bounce ideas off of you and that together we can up with some pretty dope stuff! The success of our group dynamic was solely because of you, IMHO.
  Honestly, I don't have much of a grow to say, I think maybe the one thing I was a little upset with was how the styling and UI came out for the dashboards and that the sidebar didn't go to the top. But, alas, there was more important shit to figure out, lol. Also, if at anytime I was acting unreasonable let me know! Because I am sure it happened..once or twice.

  *  Chad Ellison:   Yo chad, I was thoroughly impressed with you tenacity to attack this project. You were eager to take challenging cards and executing them. You stayed late, even tho you have a super long commute. I can be a dick sometimes, and your ability to stay calm and ground things into reality was awesome. I think we butt heads a few times on how things should be implemented because we both seem want it done the way we see the problem. We both wanted to crush this project and seemed like thats were problems (if any?) arose.
  It terms of growth, I would try to be a bit more compromising. A lot of times we either went with your way or my way, but we never actually found common ground to sit on, which is a problem for me too. Also, although it was all from the heart and hard work, feature extension work that was being done late Tuesday after Sal and I were determined to wrap things up definitely put us in a hole to crawl out on Wednesday which was way to close to comfort for me. You seemed calm throughout all of it, but finding bugs in features we thought were done days ago was very stressful. That being said, I think your technical skill is super strong have no doubt with the tenacity you show that you will get even better, keep it up!

  *  Chris Soden:    Hey Chris, you were super eager to take one more work
  and that was really great to see. You spotted bugs and were super attentive to details while we all paired. Further, your eagerness to drive in the beginning to learn for was great, keep doing that! However, I am a bit unsure where things started to go south, after Friday, it seemed as if you hadn't really had the same drive anymore. Even though base functionality was almost there, and I couldn't give you a definitive answer on what to work on, I did expect for you to take on some challenges and show us what you did. Don't be dependent on us to tell you what to do, be assertive and do some cool stuff, thats how you will be how you learn and get better. On Sunday/Monday, we gave you the Vendor Admin functionality but never really saw anything from it, which is fine but we didn't know if it was being worked on or not, which led Sal to do it Tuesday night, which is tough. Overall, I think with some fine-tuning with your assertiveness and a bit more communication you will grow into an awesome asset for any group and in the future, a company to have. Down to earth, genuine and good-hearted with an eagerness to learn!
