### Areas of Emphasis


My goals for this module were:
 * Comfort with JavaScript
 * Good leads for jobs/ possible job

### End of Module Assessment

Instructor: Jhun

Satisfactory Progress

3: Developer completes iterations 1 through 5 with few bugs and no missing functionality. (In the real final assessment, this will involve completing one supporting feature.)

Ruby Syntax & Style

3: Developer is able to write idiomatic and effective Ruby. Application makes good use of Object-Oriented modeling with few gaps in class identification and component extraction. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Rails Style & API

3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Javascript Syntax & Style

3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Testing

4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.

User Interface

3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality

Workflow

4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

-ui and ux is pretty weak.

there are some bugs in the functionality but once you get through the bugs the feature delivers
bugs:
read/undread works but you have to click the thing twice
edit doesn't clear or add the idea directly to the page.

### Feedback to Me

Through trial and error, I learned how to balance school assignments, personal jobs and job hunting. This was probably the most challenging module in that regard- because the focus wasn't purely on school.  It was also difficult to learn to say no and focus on studies, because I love to say yes to people. I think one thing I am working on is measuring the time commitments of certain activities and being honest with myself if I don't have the time.  My goal is to continue working on JavaScript and build my front-end skills, as that is something that I really am enjoying. :)

### Giving Feedback

#### From my peers:

* Alex: __ So there's this girl I know named Marina, lets leave it at that... Sike! Marina has been one of the closest people I've always kept in touch with throughout my time in Turing. What I enjoy about her is the fact how she didn't give up on herself even when she was constantly pondering whether or not she wanted to continue being in this stressful environment. This shows a lot about her, it shows that she is aware that things just don't come without putting in the work. Of course how can I forget to mention her professional side! I'm not too sure if people know this but Marina's professional side is something NOBODY else in Turing can match! Marina has that on lock where she knows exactly how to network and get in contact with people who she believes can give her a boost into getting the job she wants. I have no doubt in both her technical and professional skills that she will get the job she wants in the future. Thanks for being a good friend and also PROPS ON BEING LATINA SOFTWARE ENGINEER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -- ALEX

* Gurusundesh: - In regards to what Jeff said about different ways to approach potential barriers, I feel like Marina is in the 5%. I've seen this manifest in her work and in the way she deals with problems. To say she hustles would be an understatement, however the other side to this is that you can often see her feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. Thinking through problems instead of the more brute force approach might serve her better. At the same time I've seen this persistance carry her entire team through when otherwise they might have crashed and burned. It's a great quality but seems like it needs a little refining in order to not burn her out.

* Jeneve - Marina is as friendly and easy to be around as she is passionate and obsessed with great code. As a programmer, she excels at logic,  testing, refactoring and clean design-patterns. Marina is particularly good at pair-programming and other collaborative methods because she is communicates effortlessly, pivots easily, and doesn't shy away from the most difficult challenges.  As a former educator, Marina is an excellent and voracious learner, she would excel in challenging environments where quick adoption of a new language, framework or technology was required. Marina would be an asset to any team because she brings passion,  inclusivity and the highest level of rigor to everything she does.

#### For my peers:
* Jeneve: When I heard that Gametime was a self-selected partner project, I immediately thought of Jeneve. After working with her on our e-commerce site two modules earlier, I knew that working with her again would be a great experience. Jeneve has command of the JavaScript language, an eye for design and always finishes exactly what she says she will do. After four weeks of total pairing with her, I can honestly say that she has met every deadline set, is well organized and works tirelessly to perfect a project. She also is an excellent communicator. She discusses early on potential issues that will arise in a project, provides possible solutions and listens to others' ideas. Her analytical skills are also very strong as she can find bugs and debug quickly and efficiently. I would highly recommend Jeneve for any developer job as she is a quick learner and takes extra time to understand what she doesn't understand.

* Alex: I’m constantly impressed by the hard work and dedication that Alex puts into his projects and his learning.  It was once joked that Alex stayed on campus longer than anyone else, but no one can deny his commitment to taking time to learn and learn well.  This can be seen in his strong projects, from his Gametime project to his Trelora project.  I also appreciate Alex’s genuine curiosity and want to inquire and clarify in class. I think his commitment to learning and asking questions will be huge assets for him in the future.  I am excited to see where Alex goes on this journey as a developer and know he will do very well.

* Sunny: Sunny is a great friend and a great partner to pair with.  He learns quickly and is passionate about what he learns. In fact, he’s the only person I know who makes stickers of all the languages and gems he loves. But in all seriousness, I’m amazed by all the work that Sunny has put in throughout this program.  He puts in extra hours and stays late everyday and is constantly excited to share his work with his peers.  From leading code challenges, to creating screencasts, he loves to lead. I’m excited for his future as a web developer and am excited to see where he goes.
