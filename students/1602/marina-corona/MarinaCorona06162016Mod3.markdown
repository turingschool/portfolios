### Areas of Emphasis

Module 3 I focused primarily on learning advanced Rails. I really wanted to understand fully consuming APIs and building my own. I also wanted to start learning Javascript.

### End of Module Assessment

Notes:

* Search functionality is working
* Show page is working
* Passing a lot of params to show page
* Accessing hashes in the views instead of objects
* No need to set API key as header

* Ruby Style: 3
* Rails Syntax & API: 3
* Testing: 3
* Progression/Completion: 3
* Workflow: 4

### Work

I completed the following work this module:

#### The Pivot

In this two weeks project, our team of three chose a project we had never worked on and redesigned it to be similar to an Airbnb site.  Some highlights of the project were using Selenium to test AJAX, building multitenancy authorization, styling using Bootstrap and using an API.

* [Original Assignment]https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md

Evaluator: Nate

Notes:
Too much logic in controllers
Using PORO's in models, which is good, but needs another PORO (reservations in cart)
Good risk taking using selenium
Got trapped by AJAX functionality that didn't add much to the UX
But good work building an API before we taught you how to do that
Tests are covering lots of cases, not just LOC
UI looks good, but text on images is straining my eyes
Friends became enemies became sick became friends

* Completion: 3
* Organization: 4
* Git Workflow: 4
* TDD: 4
* Code quality: 2
* Extensions: 4

#### Rales Engine

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/marinacor1/rails_engine
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md

In this four day project I built an API that displayed basic information from a database, relationships within the database and more obscure queries.

Evaluator: Nate

Notes:

Test model level logic in unit tests
Controller tests have more than just basic success, but could have more value
Could use member and collection in your routes file
Could push if/else into model, but not the worst thing in a controller

* Completion: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Code Quality: 4
* API Design: 4
* Queries: 4



#### Personal Project

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/marinacor1/turing_connect
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md

In this project, I built a Turing alumni app that allowed alumni to connect with each other by displaying information about location and employment status.

Evaluator: Brenna

Notes:
  OAuth: Github
  APIs: Turing documentation and github/google maps
​
  UI
  - Small bug with dashboard and user information formatting
  - Add default image for non-authorized user
  - Consistent pagination
  - User can edit other profiles and results show up on my page
  - Awesome use of subtle animations/background patterns
  - Inline styling is bomb.
  - Built internal api to handle turing csv data
  - Good design decisions with how map and data are displayed/determined
  - Extensions with JavaScript and inline editing
  - 98% Coverage

### Feedback to Me

I grew a lot this module.  Choosing to do Echo over Foxtrot, was a great decision.  I was able to build more confidence as a developer and more comfort with coding.  I was especially proud of my Mastermind and HTTP projects.  The biggest areas of growth for me were testing, writing readable code and breaking large projects into smaller ones.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

#### For my peers:

    Matt Pindell:   Matt worked very hard on the project. So hard, in fact, that he got sick from the countless hours working. I can definitely attest to his strong work ethic.  I think my biggest piece of feedback for Matt would be to take on a small step and worry about getting it to basic functionality before taking on something else.  Styling, edge cases, adding ajax or specific functionality is great, but it shouldn't be the first concern.  I think that the mindset to try to tackle a lot at once, pushed us back because we were left waiting for a specific thing to get done and couldn't move forward.  It also was so complex that no one else could problem solve or write tests for it, which put the team into a tough spot when he was out the second week because of illness.

    Admir D:    Admir is super friendly and was awesome to work with. I think I would have liked to see Admir step out of his comfort zone more in the project and take on things he hadn't tried before, like styling or refactoring. It also felt that for some cards, it would take Admir longer than he initially thought and some things he didn't make into pull requests because he wasn't sure if they were worth it in the end.  I think I would have liked to see Admir try to resolve the issues that arose on his branch (or seek help) and then ultimately be able to merge the branch.  I know that Admir often would ask questions to other team members, but even seeking from mentors or other classmates is a great skill and something that would have helped him and the team.  I also think that as project manager I would have liked to see him give clearer deadlines to the project and take on more of a leadership role.

#### From my peers:

    Marina, your focus on workflow is awesome and undeniably an asset to any team you’re own. It helped keep us on a more concrete course of action, which is what we needed - especially when we hit our first bout of turbulence. I think you said as much yourself, but it would be better to voice your concerns about workflow issues earlier, and to not bottle up your thoughts about the direction the team should head in / the way we should distribute responsibilities and work. At the end of the day (and the end of my illness) I was super stoked with what you and Admir put together while I was a walking corpse - you single-handedly made the extension work - so keep crushing it! - Matt Pindell

    Marina I really admire the drive you have. Your ability to organize and complete tasks is an attribute I will try to emulate. When Matt and I went off on tangents about features we were exited about you were the team member that got us to focus on what was important to the project. I was really impressed by you pointing out areas that you wanted to become stronger in and taking them on. Before the project started you mentioned that you were not comfortable with styling and by the time the project wrapped up you had developed really solid front end skills. I have really enjoyed being able to learn with you. I feel like after completing this project you have a lot more faith in your abilities and I hope you continue riding that wave. You seem to be your harshest critic but I can honestly say I am impressed with the skills you have developed as a programmer. - Admir Draganovic
