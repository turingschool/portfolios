## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This is starting to look like a trend. Each module I keep thinking to myself that this is going to be the one where I figure out where I can offer the most value, what I'll love the most, and what I'll someday be able to convince someone to pay me to do. If there's any silver lining it's that I think I'm getting closer. I enjoyed everything that I did this module, especially taking advantage of the opportunity that the personal project gave us to stretch out a little bit and try something new. I liked my time working in javascript, and I'm looking forward to learning React. I'm hoping that JS in general will be something that clicks with me. Looking forward to mod 4 and hitting the job search hard.

### End of Module Assessment

Notes:

- Request specs don't need to be nested in folders
- Request specs cover API functionality well. Good value.
- Good use of API controller
- Good use of strong params. You could be more railsy with `require`, but we didn't ask for it.
- Nice use of `except` in routes. Saved one symbol.
- Your search feature test isn't testing for many of the user story parts
- Service could be more DRY. Move common params to the initializer.
- Searching within 15 miles instead of 25. Also not passing a `pageSize`, so you're limited to 10 results
- Nice use of table in the view
- Not parsing the hours in the `stores#show` view
- Nice clean Controller
- Nice clean model

### Work

The individual work that I had this mod was limited to API Curious and Rails Engine.

#### API Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/s-espinosa/api_curious)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

For API curious I elected to read information from the Soundcloud API and display it locally after logging in with OAuth. I worked with SASS to style the pages, created my own image for users with no images, and displayed basic information about a user and that user's followers.

#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/s-espinosa/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

* API Design was solid.
* Could move some of the params stuff out.
* Great use of ActiveRecord.

* Sal, man, you are a joy to work with. Even when things get heated and I get pissed off from...something, you always were able to calm things and actually allow the group to move forward. It helped that we were also on the same page  for most of the project. I enjoyed how you asked what I wanted to work because you knew I wasn't having fun. I felt comfortable taking risks because I knew you would back me up. It was awesome I could bounce ideas off of you and that together we can up with some pretty dope stuff! The success of our group dynamic was solely because of you, IMHO.
Honestly, I don't have much of a grow to say, I think maybe the one thing I was a little upset with was how the styling and UI came out for the dashboards and that the sidebar didn't go to the top. But, alas, there was more important shit to figure out, lol. Also, if at anytime I was acting unreasonable let me know! Because I am sure it happened..once or twice. - Jonathan Bernesser

* Sal was very laid back and easy to work with. He was very patient and solves problems in a very methodical and diplomatic way, asking for feedback and the thoughts of his other team members while making suggestions. Sal is very technically skilled and I enjoyed learning from him. I also appreciate him taking the time to pair on some features that he was stronger in. - Chad Ellison

* Sal, I want to thank you for always being available. In addition to all your coding work you did an excellent job of troubleshooting problems. I think you were a great help to all of us. As a group, I think we did a great job of being able to split up and still communicate and coordinate our individual progress. - Chris Soden

#### Trelora Signage

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/s-espinosa/signagerableio)

* Javascript is functional
* CSS does some tasks for you. Actually solved some intermediate-advanced CSS, like rotation.
* Logic is well broken out and where it belongs. Naming could improve with a little refactoring.
* Admin stuff. Looks better than most admin stuff.

Sal: Dude working with your on this Trelora project was by far one of the coolest team projects I've ever had throughout my time in Turing. I can't thank you enough for being open to letting me partner up with you because I really did not have anything planned out with how I was going to do this final project for the model. I got to say, you are very damn good when it comes to pushing forward on things that seem really hard. I like how you were always able to keep a positive mindset throughout your time trouble shooting too. It makes me reflect on how I should approach bugs with that mindset as well. Thanks for making history with me on delivering our product to a real client! You can't even imagine how hyped I am with the way how everything turned out that I just really want to show this off to everyone I know. - Alex Navarrete


## Community

### Giving Feedback

**Jon Bernesser:**	Jon! You were great throughout this project, and I think the end quality is directly attributable to how hard you worked and the standards you kept. I was consistently impressed with your willingness to try something new, your ability to pick it up, and the dedication to see it through. I don't feel like I have to tell you to keep doing that. I don't think anyone could stop you, which is fantastic. I would also say that you're probably the reason that we started to push out and work on things by ourselves, which was also pretty fantastic. It was good to get that time under my belt, and great to see how things came together even as we worked on them separately. I don't think it'll come as any surprise that the one piece of feedback I can give is to try to get used to working with people who might still be working through things that you already know. I'm positive you'll land at a place with people with strong skills that you can count on, but I'm also fairly confident that not too much time will pass before you'll be moving up the ladder and mentoring some junior devs. Try to be patient with them. Sappy as hell, but I can't wait to see the work that you start cranking out. It's going to be good stuff.

**Chad Ellison:**	Chad! It was great to get to know you over the course of the project. I have a sneaking suspicion that having a child(!) and taking some time off would put some serious rust on my coding skills, so it was nice to start work with you and see that you seemed to be picking up pretty seamlessly. In those last couple of days I think I got a little nervous about just locking everything down, and worry that I might have cut some opportunities to learn new things short in order to just get them done. I hesitate to tell you to embrace that as a strategy, because it feels like it's a terrible loss to not explore things and do them the right way, but I guess the feedback  I would give would be to be prepared to have a client who wants things done yesterday, and doesn't have time for that exploration. Overall I had a solid experience on this project (which seems like no small feat given how exhausted everyone seemed by the end), and hope you can say the same.

**Chris Soden:**	It was good to work with you, and nice to get to know you a little bit better. It sounds silly, but I feel like late night Pete's runs and horror stories about long code slogs are going to be some of the things that I look back on most fondly when I think about my time here at Turing. It was good to have you along for that ride since it felt like I hadn't gotten to really talk to you much before this project. In terms of feedback I would say the one thing I would advise would be to stay engaged with the tough stuff, and to speak up and take the reins a little bit more when it comes to deciding what to do next. I think sometimes it seemed like you were looking for an assignment, as opposed to hopping in to take the next waffle card. We're all in the same boat here, and our group's organization was definitely pretty flat, so don't be shy about picking for yourself what you want the next part of the project to be. Use those Waffle cards that we generate to figure out what needs done, and then snag it and assign it to yourself. Overall I think the Pivot was a pretty solid experience for our group, and was glad to have you as someone who was easy to work with as part of our team.

### Being a Community Member

Sal has been a fantastic mentor to me! During my pre work, he was very responsive and learned a lot from him. Sal has a strong technical knowledge and is very patient. I appreciate that Sal is concerned about giving you the answer, but rather explaining you the logic and helping you come to the conclusions. Throughout the module, he helped me in several occasions. Sal also helped me with some pair difficulties that I had during my final project. He was a good person to talk to and ask for advice. He gave me a fresh perspective to look at the problem, which helped me to find the best way to work with my pair. - Roberta Doyle

### Playing a Part

This module I served as both a member of SAB, and a posse leader for Golick. As a member of SAB I facilitated group retro, participated in weekly SAB meetings, and participated in bi-weekly staff retros. As a posse leader for Golick I worked to continue to encourage our members to participate in the posse, using our daily meetings and slack channel to highlight side projects, discuss interesting technologies, and work through personal, professional, and technical issues. I also was part of a group of students that met with Beth Sebian to discuss potential improvements to Gear-Up. As in previous modules, while I valued these commitments, I believe the most important part I played in this module was to serve as a sounding board for people throughout the module to let them vent, talk through issues they were having, and generally be an empathetic person.
