## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module, my goals were two: to soak up everything I could in the time I had, and to find my place more specifically within the web development landscape. By my own measure I did a pretty decent job at the former and not so much at the latter. In a weird way I feel lucky to have travelled to Denver specifically for this program. I turned to Drew at one point, after he gave me a hard time about not leaving the basement, and admitted to him "all my friends are here." So, yes, I took it all in this module. Stayed late and watched Fringe with Regis, tried to coax actionable feedback out of my classmates at Retro, worked with [Allan](https://github.com/amaxwellblair) to try to figure out what to do with our posse, and tried to learn as much as I could and help as much as I was able.

Meanwhile, I struggled I tried to narrow my own focus. I think there's value to differentiating myself, but knowing that and actually taking the plunge are two very different things. Elm, and Elixir, and Go? (Oh my!) I'm starting to wonder if this is a worthwhile goal. Not to say that it's not something I'd like to see happen, but maybe it's something that will happen more organically than I expect? I can't tell if this is a little bit of a cop-out or if it's part of me starting to think more about what I can do with the tools I'm picking up. Can I make a thing that's usable, that's beautiful enough to not drive people away, and works? I don't know. We'll see.

Goals for next module: set more easily assessable goals. Pre-module work: develop a rubric.

### End of Module Assessment

**Challenge: Mavis Bacon**

Assessed By: Rachel

Result: Pass

Description: Given an existing rails project with a form designed for input from a student trying to learned to type, asked to create a model method to score input from a student for accuracy. During the assessment, asked to draft integration and model tests and implement features for an index page that would show the average score and number of attempts for each level.

##### Notes:

* able to prepare appropriate data for testing
* great explanations of steps taken
* use of save_and_open_page to verify assumptions
* able to write model test for average_percent (when prompted :)
* comfortable generating migration to add column
* able to go down strange paths comfortably

##### Scores:

1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking: 4
2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library: 3
3. Rails Syntax & API: 4
4. MVC & Rails Style: 4
5. Testing: 3.5
6. Collaboration: 4

### Mid Module Assessment

**Challenge: Pet Shop**

Assessed By: Andrew Carmer

Result: Pass

Description: Given a Rails project with existing tests, asked to ensure that all tests pass. Required to go down to model level tests when appropriate.

##### Notes:

* Jumped in a couple of times at the end when we were jumping around
* Continue to think about where you came from, where things are going
* When looking at forms, try to think about how it works and make an inference as to why its breaking
* Continue to focus on testing
* Keep it up

##### Scores:

* Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking: 3.5
* Ruby Syntax & Standard Library: 3
* Rails Syntax & API: 3
* Rails Style: 4
* Testing: 3.5
* Collaboration: 4

### Work

The individual work given this module was not evaluated by instructors. I've included links to the projects I completed independently below. Each helped me build familiarity with the MVC model, and, in later projects, Rails and Active Record.

##### Notes:

* all base functionality exists; iteration 8 needs to be scoped to the client
* use of "builder" objects for data presentation
* good use of Active Record for querying
* very clean views
* being able to use optional parameters would be beneficial in the payload creator
* take a look at edge cases for more robust tests
* use a helper to create links
* put things that are grouped into a partial

##### Scores:

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation/Breaking Logic Into Components: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3.5
* Sinatra/Web and Business Logic: 4
* View Layer: 3

##### Feedback:

>Working with you on Rush Hour was a pleasure. You are flexible and patient- always an anchor in our group when stress was rising. You know A LOT; that is clear. But one of the best qualities you brought to the team was a seemingly inexhaustible spring of ideas and process to try even after we had reached beyond the extent of our knowledge.  Your contribution to the 1602 cohort is bigger than just what you do in your role on the student advisory board. In that role, you are clearly attuned to the concerns of the whole cohort- you always bring up the issues that are on my mind in retros and you are able to address those and other concerns with sensitivity and eloquence. You have a knack for putting people at ease while assuring them that their worries are valid and are being heard. -**Jeneve Parrish**

>I think you do a good job keeping calm with all of the different approaches that came in a group of 4 in our project. I see your future exploding in this field and know that someday in the near future you will leave your legacy in this industry. I guess my only constructive feedback is that sometimes i saw you struggle a bit with so many different ideas from the group. I think you should listen a bit more to different peoples perspectives before deciding on which direction to go maybe helpful in the future. I look forward to working on the million dollar idea with you. -**Ali Andersen**

>Picture this. You have Ali, Jeneve, and myself(Sunny) shouting out random programming esque words. A lot of the time we were agreeing, a lot of the time there were differences. Everybody drunk on programming passion with a side of frustration. The way this works is with a guy like Sal. He simultaneously could listen to three different people and wield his keyboard to implement all ideas to their true potential, letting everybody make their mark while rebasing our emotions. I feel fortunate that I had an opportunity to work with you man. -**Sunny Khalsa**


#### Little Shop (Hedy Woo, Sal Espinosa, Thom Pickett)

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/thompickett/super-coders)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)
* [Production](http://super-coders.herokuapp.com/)

**E-Commerce website** where customers should be able to place orders and view placed order details. The site admin can manage products and categories in addition to processing and completing orders.

Assessed By: Andrew

##### Notes:
* Views
    * Create team gets a little close to the bottom, could be a little larger
    * All contracts lacks some detail in the admin view - some additional clarity would be nice
    * Would be nice to have the admin be able to edit a coder when they see an individual coder
    * Would be nice to have pictures be links to individual coder from the index
    * Use image tag over <img src=“<%= linkstuff %>”>
    * In show for coder - refactor if statement about coder being active to a helper
    * On navbar - would’ve pulled out team.contents.keys.count
    * If contract.completed in the shared contract partial - could potentially pull into a presenter
    * Might not need to refactor to partial if it’s just a couple of lines and you end up having to pull into smaller partial
* Controllers
    * In the ApplicationController: navcategories as a before action will really slow down the app.
    * find_by_slug might be getting deprecated: consider replacing with find_by(slug: slug)
    * Might think about what happens if teammates don’t get set to the contract - change to a .new and then a .save only if the teammates were successfully added.
* Classes
    * Probably shouldn’t be creating a teammate in the Contract class - have a PORO that creates the team, sends the sms, etc.
* Testing
    * Stub the admin login method.
    * Scope assertions
    * Look at RSPEC different contexts vs scenarios - various - try one with an invalid name, invalid email, etc.
    * Team object test - would like to see tests for the smaller methods.

##### Scores:
1. Feature Completeness: 4 - All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions
2. Views: 4 - Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present
3. Controllers: 4 - Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack
4. Models: 4 - Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features
5. Testing: 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels
6. Usability
  3.5: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers
  3.5: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready
7. Workflow: 4 - Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

##### Feedback:

>I could throw quite a lot of good superlatives on Sal, and prove them all true. I didn’t know Sal prior to Little Shop, but I pegged him to be on my dream team. I was just too lucky to have that realized (thank you student.sample!).  Sal is a rock star!! Not just in terms of what he knows, but also in the way he organizes his thoughts. He consistently goes for what is the most essential down to the least. He is not succumbed by low level details or distractions found within the projects. He also had to deal with two ill teammates from the midpoint of the project on, and so he did a lot of the heavy-lifting, especially towards the end.  And while, this would ordinarily be a point of sore contention, he never made any of us feel guilty. Our project is a whole lot better than what it would have otherwise been because of him. Sal’s also very giving. He’s the king of snacks, and only eats what he can share.  That says so much about his personhood! I would hope that ruby student.sample would grant me more opportunities to pair and learn from him.  Thanks for the goodtimes!-**Hedy Woo**

### Giving Feedback

>**Jeneve Parrish:** Jeneve! You were my rock in the Rush Hour project. I think you know, but just in case: I very often found myself looking to you to validate things I was saying, and to check the validity of approaches other teammates were proposing. You clearly communicated your time constraints, and then proceeded to outwork most of the group, popping back online in the evening after we had gone home for the day. You handled all the styling, and gave us a wonderful looking page (that I know never quite met your expectations, but seemed super awesome to me). In class I feel like you've been more outspoken this module, and it's been a pleasure to hear you ask the questions that I was about to ask (or thought about asking, but then kept my hand down for no good reason whatsoever). As we were working, I know that git was something that you wanted to work on, and the one recommendation I have would be to find something you can break so that you can learn how to bring something back from the brink. Other than that, I think you should keep doing what you're doing. There's a part of me that thinks that you don't believe it when Allan and I talk about how talented we think you are, but I promise you that it's absolutely genuine. Keep killing it.

>**Sunny Khalsa:** It was good to work with you after not having the opportunity in mod one. You definitely helped to keep us on track, and seemed to do a good job of filling in knowledge that somehow the rest of us had missed. You're a patient team member, and generally seemed willing to go down a different paths as we were figuring out how to do something, which was great in a group of four. You had a nice way of recommending a change/pushing us to try a different approach. It's hard to come up with something to recommend to you. It seems like you pretty much have things under control, and if you keep going I'm betting things will come keep coming up roses.

>**Ali Andersen:** It was great to finally work with you after all the talk we had in mod one. I think you do a good job of trying to hunt out solutions as the group talks through an issue, which was great in a group of four where it sometimes got a little crazy with all the voices going at the same time. It was good to have you take the time to go in a corner and try to see if you could figure out, and come back with a recommendation for a solution. This might be a little stale, and I think we were all struggling at the time, but I think taking some time to really digest the flow of information through a MVC might be beneficial. It's definitely a comment I received from Andrew, and something that has helped me as I work through these issues. Overall, though, keep it up. You're a good team member, and definitely walked us back from a few cliffs.

>**Claudia Kiesenhofer:** I definitely enjoyed working with you, and it was nice to have the opportunity to work this together. I think you have high standards, and it was nice to have you there to keep me up to spec. I also found that you seemed to have a really good handle on how rails works, and a solid memory of the resources that we could use to get the project done. I feel as though sometimes I might not have let on that I wasn't completely up to speed, but there were definitely times that I asked myself 'how does she know that!?' Based on our interactions, it seemed like maybe you would like to work on your Ruby a little bit, and I don't think that's a bad idea, but I also didn't think it was something I noticed as particularly weak. I ended up getting an early start on Saturday/Sunday, and worry that may have given you the impression that things were easier for me than they actually work. Keep working, keep pushing, and I think everything will be good for you.

### Being a Community Member

>I really enjoyed working with you, it was fun figuring out how to do a whole project from the very beginning. I appreciated that we could do most of it together and agreed on the process following TDD. It was very helpful to see how you set up the styles in the css files. I am satisfied with the outcome of our project. I  felt a bit slow on Sunday afternoon when we had to figure out the custom methods on the controllers and couldn’t tell if you were ok doing this part together. I would be happy to work with you again on another project. -**Claudia Kiesenhofer**

>Sal has been incredibly helpful this module. I have paired with him a few times and his teaching style is exemplary. He allowed me to reach my own conclusions in a gentle and supportive environment. We are cautioned in Module 1 to never allow others to "steal our learning" and Sal is the perfect example of a teacher who leads his students to achieve their own understanding instead of simply handing over the answers. His tutoring helped me to establish a level of confidence in my own skills at an early stage, and I am grateful to have had the privilege to learn from him. -**Sonia Gupta**

### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Member of SAB - soliciting feedback from peers and participating in weekly meeting as well as staff retros on a biweekly basis.
* Golick Posse Co-Leader - organized early activities for posse members.
    * Golick met on a consistent basis in B at 8:30 each morning.
    * Early in the module I set up a Sinatra application on a Digital Ocean Droplet that members then hit with curl requests to attempt to determine the next step in a series of riddles that caused them to hit all the CRUD endpoints.
    * My favorite thing about this experience this module has likely been the morning conversations about the merits and drawbacks of this that and the other language or framework. One of the real benefits of Golick is that we're language agnostic, which means that we have advocates for Rust, Go, and Elm each doing their own thing, but coming together.
    * The benefit to me as a professional has likely been to remind me of the value of some structure. Allan and I went in with the idea that this should be a posse that's self-directed, and I think we have a group that doesn't need us to provide lesson plans each week. They're also not afraid to tell us when they're a little bored with what we have prepared. I think one of the main goals of our posse isn't to provide a strict framework for learning any one thing, but to offer a space to show and talk about those projects that people are tackling on their own that not everyone might care about. To that end, I we're currently considering having that sharing space be a little more structured. People kept coming to posse meetings, which I think shows that there was some value there (I'm sure any one of them could have opted for an extra half hour of sleep), but I think we'd still like to see what we can do to maximize what we're actually doing with that time.
* Pre-Work Mentor - For Roberta Doyle
* Tutoring - Paired with a 1603 student in pairing organized by Thom, and then again later as students reached out.
* Student Led Elective - [Just Enough HTML & Sass](https://gist.github.com/s-espinosa/9c2406709f1887a9897522c3d107ae72)(to get you through mod 2)
* Blog Post: [Why not simple?](http://s-espinosa.github.io/ui/2016/04/28/why-not-simple.html) An argument for making instructions easy.
