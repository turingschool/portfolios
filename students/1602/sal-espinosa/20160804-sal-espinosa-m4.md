# Sal Espinosa - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module as in the past I feel as though my main goal was to get as much out of my time at Turing as I could. In the past, I think that I've felt that I should have a more defined goal, whether that be a specific technology or project. This time around I'm glad that I didn't take that approach. I learned a lot of JavaScript this mod, and I'm happy to have had the opportunity to do so, but in these last few weeks, getting as much out of Turing as possible meant taking advantage of the time I had left with the people around me. I'm going to miss them terribly.

### End of Module Assessment

Notes
- Sort functionality not case insensitive
- Missing selenium in JS testing

Satisfactory Progress: 3/4 - All functionality complete
Ruby Syntax & Style: 3
Rails Style & API: 4
Javascript Syntax & Style: 3
Testing: 2 - Add some selenium/js tests
User Interface: 3 - Lack of helpful error message
Workflow: 4

Looks like all you need to do is add some additional testing - coverage for controllers or coverage in some way of js
Original notes from Brenna - Testing upgraded to a 3

##### Feedback
* Sal was a great project manager for the team. He was understanding about his teammates' emotional needs but also kept us on track. Like Kami, he is extremely skilled at abstractions and breaking down logic. So I feel lucky to have been able to consider both Sal and Kami my teachers during Game Time. Sal rocks, which is why Turing is keeping him! - Ling Tran

#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd)

##### Points
Submission 1: 150/150
Submission 2: 150/150

##### Feedback
* Sal is the guy you want on your team - hands down, he is one of the best people I have known. As a programmer, Sal excels at algorithmic thinking and writing clean, reusable code that is well tested and robust. He is particularly good at pair-programming and other collaborative methods because he is a natural leader who listens attentively, communicates effortlessly, and values different approaches to a problem.  As a former educator, Sal is an excellent and voracious learner, he would excel in challenging environments where quick adoption of a new language, framework or technology was required. Sal would be an asset to any team because he brings excellence, curiosity, inclusivity and and eye for design and detail to everything he does. - Jeneve Parrish

* Sup Sal!  Finally got to work with you and real talk - you're a perfect professional.  Always on point with our tasks, writing things down, keep track of what's left to do and what we already did.  You slayed the project manager role, and I know our project definitely wouldn't have been as successful if you weren't there. Apologies to you that you had to experience burn-out Jon instead of try-hard Jon.  I guess this just means that we'll have to do some awesome stuff in the future together.  Thanks for making the Scale Up project such an enjoyable one despite my efforts to the contrary.  You definitely don't need this, but best of luck in your new position training the Turing devs of the future!  Keep them just below my level so I can keep a job will ya?!  Thanks for everything Sal, I really look forward to seeing what you do in the future. - Jon Liss

### Giving Feedback

**Jeneve Parrish:** Jeneve! It was great to work with you again. I think you have a better sense by now, but, just in case, every time I bring you up with the people who's opinions I value the response is the same: "Jeneve? She's a killer." I always have faith that when you set off on your own for the evening you're going to come back with finished work. It sounds like such a simple thing now that I put it down, but it matters. Again this time around you proved that when I'm stuck and we pair there's a good chance you'll find a way through the rubble. I was stuck on the issue of how to render that jobs component, couldn't find the answer in the research I'd done, and you cut through with a solution. I'd like to see you drive more! I feel like I could've done a better job of asking you to take over every now and again, but I hope in the future when confronted with someone hogging the keyboard that you'll elbow your way in. I suppose this isn't complete without me mentioning what a pleasure it was to have you as a personality on the team. It was certainly good to talk code, but also great to talk just Mod 4 and other nonsense. It's sad to me that I just realized how much I'm going to miss you, and can only hope that you're on to an awesome next step. Keep doing what you're doing.

**Jon Liss:**	JD! It was good to finally work with you, and I'm sorry it had to be on a project where you couldn't break out the Java/C++ skills that I know you're burning to use. I feel as though the most impressive thing to see from you was how you can step into a language/framework that's largely unfamiliar to you and still make solid contributions. I think that not having Game Time as JS background would have made Looking For a pretty tough project for me, and you were still able to make those connections. I guess the one thing I couldn't tell was if you wanted to really dig in with React, or if you were happy to have it as something that you knew a little bit about. If not, or if you were just exhausted, then that totally makes sense, but if you did, then I would say be sure to speak up and dig in. I think we took on a lot of parts of the project that were mostly cleanup, but if you were more interested in tackling a new feature/building a new component from scratch then we certainly could have done that. Just be sure to speak up and let people know what you want. Either way, I'm absolutely sure that things are going to go well. You have so much good stuff ahead of you that I'm jealous. Enjoy it.

**Kami Boers:**	Kam! It was great to finally get to work with you, and I'm glad that we didn't get out of Turing having missed the opportunity. I kind of already knew what you could do, but it was nice to see it for myself. It was interesting to work with you and realize that you're kind of a lone wolf. We certainly had plenty of time to pair, and I never felt like you were absent in any sense, but I was always surprised to come back some morning and find that you had just gone home and demolished some code all by yourself. I know that you think that I knocked out more code, but, as I've already said, I honestly don't see it. I feel like you are responsible for both the heart and soul of the game we put together. You laid the groundwork, I came in and filled in some blanks, and then you came back and gave the game some personality. It was great. We were a team. I really love the thing we made, and I hope you're as happy with it as I am. I guess that the only thing I would say is that I would hope you don't feel like you have to do it all by yourself and that you recognize the contributions you made.

**Ling Tran:**	Ling! What can I say that hasn't already been said. I think that it's great that you are continuously looking for feedback and checking to see how you can improve/contribute. I liked that you were frequently looking to use new tools, and to incorporate them into the work we were doing. The one thing I would say (and that I think I've said) is that it's important to be flexible in those situations, especially when things aren't working. I feel as though I've had some great moments when I've walked into a problem that another team was having and been helpful simply because I was able to help them abandon their idea of what *should* be working. I frequently find that when I'm stuck on something that *should* be working, that I know in my heart shouldn't be breaking, is the time when it's best to accept that (despite what I might think I know) it's *not* working and try something else. That said, there's obviously a balance to be struck, and we'll never learn anything new/more efficient if we always go with the easy path. You were my first friend at Turing, and it was nice to have this chance to work with you. I can't wait to see where you end up next.

### Playing a Part

This module I continued to serve as a posse leader for Golick. While I was certainly involved, it was especially fulfilling this module to see Roberta from 1605 step up to really start to take control of the posse. I think one of the things that Allan worried about when Golick was mainly 1511 and 1602 students was if it would survive after we left. With Roberta I feel like it's in good hands, and it's great to see something that we made continue to be a presence here at Turing.

Again this module, Beth reached out to me to give some feedback on one of her Gear-Up lessons, though in a less formal context than previously.
