# Laura Caroselli - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For this module, I wanted to learn more about CSS positioning and responsive web design, semantic markup and web accessibility, and the different ways to employ JavaScript to shape user interaction and page behavior. I feel like I accomplished my goals for this mod, and I am excited to learn even more in the next module. I had a lot of fun and remained actively engaged in my learning, and it made the mod an absolute joy and an interesting challenge. I appreciate all the feedback and collaboration from classmates and my instructors - without them, I couldn't have accomplished my goals for this mod!

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Below are the list of individual projects I worked on through Mod 1. I really appreciated the time to digest and work out problems on my own, it really helped to wrap my head around each line of code I was writing. Completing these projects solo was an excellent learning experience, however I also really appreciated the chance to collaborate and work on projects with others. Group projects are full of learning opportunity! 

#### (Number Guesser)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lcaroselli/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser is an app that allows users to guess a randomly generated number (between 1 and 100) with hints given when their guess was either too low or too high. The user can clear their guess and reset the game and also enter their own minimum and maximum range for a generated number. 

In my evaluation, I was asked to be more thoughtful about my CSS margins and spacing and to refactor my code to keep it DRY.

#### (Lightning Talk)

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/frontend-lightning-talks)

My lightning talk was about pseudocoding and the best practices in breaking your problem down into easy-to-code chunks.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

There were 3 paired projects in Mod 1, all of which provided me with a unique learning experience and reinforced my skillset. I enjoyed my time working in pairs and gained a lot from each experience!

#### (Linked List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lcaroselli/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This application can be used to keep track of your bookmarks (links). The two fields required are the website title and the url. Once this is submitted, the application will build a list of bookmarks, which can be deleted or marked as read. Marking a bookmark as read changes the styling of the bookmark to indicate it's been read. There is also totals displayed for number of bookmarks and how many are read/unread.

Nick and I were asked to leverage semantic tagging and GitHub a bit more.

"Laura, I think overall we kicked ass on linked list, and I really enjoyed having you as a partner. I think we worked well on establishing our relationship, and planning our approach and schedule. In the one instance in which you needed to push back our start time, you were unnecessarily apologetic which showed me just how much you valued my time. I also never got a chance to thank you for being pro-active and reserving some work spaces for us during the week. There were a few instances in which you voiced concerns about some mysterious code that I had added, and while you may think this didn't come across very hmm…gently…I actually appreciated your desire to ensure complete comfort with every line of code. I would say that while we were able to achieve near 100% coding in a pair programming approach, due to increasing complexities in projects, individual work might be necessary for your future projects. I would encourage you to discuss strategies with your partner on how individual code contributions can still be completely digested by both parties. I look forward to continuing this journey with you in my cohort and hope we get a chance to work together again!"


#### (IdeaBox)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lcaroselli/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This application can be used to keep track of your ideas. The two fields required are the title of your idea and the text of your idea. Once this is submitted, the application will build a list of ideas with the most current idea at the top. Saved ideas are also editable with the ability to modify the text and body. Ideas can be 'upvoted' and 'downvoted' according to the quality (swill -> plausible -> genius) and you may also delete them as you see fit. You can filter through your existing ideas by using the search bar.

In our evaluation, Brenna gave us some suggestions on how we could refactor our code, such as our for loops and switch statements.

"Laura! I certainly had a good and interesting time working with you. You were SO helpful, and SO organized! I could really benefit from adopting some of your methods. Our pairing was certainly an interesting one, and I'm really glad it was because I feel like I got to know you a LOT better.  I have immense respect for you after you were faced with something enormously difficult for you, and you did it anyway. And I also am very pleased with how you had so much patience and understanding when it came to the stuff I was struggling with. I would imagine it's not easy :sweat_smile:. As far as coaching feedback, I suppose I'd say that it would behoove you to be a little more confident and assert yourself more. But maybe you are confident in yourself already! I don't know. What I do know is: you are a PHENOMENAL coder, and a super awesome person."


#### (2DoBox Pivot)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jasonlucas907/2DoBox-Pivot-1705)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This app took someone elses codebase and required us to refactor the code and switch the Ideabox into a Task list. 

During our evaluation, Brenna gave Jason and I some more suggestions in how we could refactor the code even further and still keep the functions single responsibility.

"Laura, I had a great time working with you on the 2DoBox project.  I feel like given the other stresses of the week we were able to develop a plan and accomplish everything on time and with ease.  I really enjoyed getting to work independent of each other giving me more experience with pull requests.  Thank you for being so detailed in your work.  I learned a great deal watching you restructure the Script syntax and your updates to the HTML with WAI-ARIA were the most detailed that I have seen.  I personally am a fan of getting constructive feed back on things that I could work on.  I would love to give you some, however I have none to give you based on this experience.  Thank you for making the final project of Mod1 enjoyable.  Very well done."


## D: Professional Skills
I genuinely appreciate Turing's emphasis on developing professional skills that will suit us well in the workplace and beyond after graduation. 

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)
* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/lcaroselli/0f73f6421367bbae8e794297dc400299)

1. Growth/Fixed Mindset <br />
I think starting off our gear-up series with the growth/fixed mindset discussion really helped to instill in me that I am meant to be here, and that I can learn if I am responsible and focused with my learning.
If I think about my end goal, I am confident that I can grow into the developer I want to become. I can keep up my momentum if I'm not afraid to ask questions. Continuing to have the motivation and willingness to grow and be vulnerable will be significant as I continue Turing. 

2. Getting Better at Difficult Things <br />
Getting Better at Difficult Things really helped me identify some tips I can integrate into my own learning. Currently, I try to focus on small tasks and tackle one problem at a time, but this Gear Up helped me think about the bigger picture. I think I could better manage my cognitive resources by setting tasks for the day in a list ahead of time, instead of stressing about what my tasks for the day will be day-of.

3. Introverts/Extroverts/Ambiverts <br />
As an ambivert (leaning extrovert), I appreciated this discussion, and it was particularly helpful in identifying how the introverted working style best operates. It was interesting to learn about how I can best help an introverted partner when we're working together on projects. Since the introverted working style tends to get energy from time alone, I can be more thoughtful to not overwhelm them with conversation, or railroad the project a certain direction without their feedback.

4. Strengths & Storytelling <br />
I am still working on my story, but I decided to attend Turing and follow this career path because it is something that has interested me since I was a kid. As I grew older, I gradually became more and more curious about programming and developed my skills in short bursts. I wanted to accelerate these skills and fully commit myself to this field, and I knew Turing could help me achieve these goals. This gear-up was helpful in guiding me toward creating a more concrete identity for myself as a developer. 

5. Debugging the Gender Gap <br />
This movie and gear-up gave me hope for our community. My experiences as a woman entering a technical field are very similar to the stories shared in the film. As a child, I was discouraged from pursuing anything "too hard" or "too technical" for a girl, and I've had to constantly remind myself that I am good enough to be here. This movie helped expose the industry for what it currently is and shed light on the problems we have introducing tech to young girls. 

6. Leveraging Privelege <br />
This gear-up was a great follow-up to the previous. We watched two videos on privilege and they both lended themselves to an excellent group discussion. These videos identified multiple categories of privelege that we might not be aware of, and I appreciated it immensely. Often, we are blind to our own privilege and confronting it can be uncomfortable. It takes an active approach to recognize your privilege and leverage it in a positive way.



## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I spent a lot of time with my classmates and peers in other mods lending support and positive feedback - I wanted to be that person that others could either bounce ideas off of or come to for advice. I also attended optional spikes, Tuesdays with Toni, and Friday morning talks to become better integrated within the Turing community. I participated in lunch roulettes and attended a couple of posse meetings. I wanted to use this mod to learn more about the community and create a tribe within our cohort.
