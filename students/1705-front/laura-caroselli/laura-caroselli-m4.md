# Laura Caroselli - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For this mod, I wanted to focus on understanding and refining my back-end, server-side skills with node, express, postgreSQL, and knex. I did the first two projects alone, which was a great learning experience and really pushed me to understand and build server-side JavaScript from scratch. I also focused a lot of my energy and attention to job searching and looking for places that I think would be a good fit. Overall, I enjoyed this mod, even with the added stress of the job search.
