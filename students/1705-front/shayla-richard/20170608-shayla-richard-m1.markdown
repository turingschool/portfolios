Shayla Richard - M1 Portfolio

Areas of Emphasis
I wanted to be an active learner this module. I arrived at Turing completely green and without full knowledge of all of the concepts we'd cover. As a repeater for Mod 1, I was very aware of what my challenges were. I know what I do well and what my struggles are, however I feel as though I was able to overcome the things that scared me. I was able to pair, complete projects and get a better grasp of how I should learn, and what that should look like.

A: End of Module Assessment


B: Individual Work & Projects
I worked alone on Numberguess and Idea Box. I had a good time working on those things and felt as if my JS skills greatly improved by those projects.

##feedback from Hector Sanchez##
Shayla, I'd like to start off by saying that it was an absolute pleasure to have been able to work with you.  I enjoyed every minute of it and the experience was extremely beneficial for me as I learned so much from working on this project with you.  You mentioned that you felt that you didn't contribute much to this project and I want to tell you that is not true.  We worked on this together from the beginning, we stayed together after class for hours working on this together, we built this from the ground up as a team, and at the end we understood every line of code that we had written and we were able to defend in during our evaluation as a team.  You're a great programmer and I know you will do great here in the rest of the modules to come and in your future career as a software developer.  The only advice I can think to give you is work on thinking of better names to refer functions by that make sense if someone else is reading our code. Thank you again and I look forward to working with you again in the future!

##feedback from Travis Rollins, partner on 2DO Box Pivot##
I had a really great experience working with you, Shayla. I loved your positivity and energy throughout our project. There were a couple times when we got stuck and you were really great at finding an alternative by either googling what something meant or taking a look at another project to see if that could help. Like when we were trying to clear out those TODOs, you found an example on another project and then looked up what .splice() means. You also had a lot of great advice for how we could refactor the code and make it more concise. I realize there were a couple times where I made you feel like I was leaving you behind and I apologize for that.  It was a stressful week, and I feel like maybe we took a little too long before we actually started the project to meet all of our goals.  I also realize you were sick which made things more difficult and I tried to do my best to help support you.  I think we handled the stress pretty well as a team.  I think for future projects, I would suggest maybe starting the project sooner and staying more focused on the project to help you and your partner so you can better achieve your goals.  I know I learned a lot from working with you, and I hope you did as well.  =)

Gear Up

(Session Name)
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown Growth mindset was such an introduction to the grit component that we are required to have as students at Turing. I enjoyed hearing Dr. Dweck discuss how to keep ourselves from creating a false sense of success. Creating praise for process, effort, and growth in an area. It's shortsighted to praise talent and intelligence. I loved the mantra to focus on the"not yet" component of learning a new area. https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md Learning difficult things was the confirmation needed that let me know I was not off kilter with how I learnor why I was feeling completely inept. I did like Kathy Sierra's video and breakdown of how to absorb and learn to master information in a way that was utilizing our cognitive resources. I'd never thought about the brain's capacity to take in or regurgitate information. I thought it was me not being intelligent enough. https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/commit/dd94f0e2fc32cacb4b14e07a603cdddf4622b6e8 Working styles was a really fun exercise in learning how to utilize our strengths to better leverage relationships and working environments. I also was suprised at how my styles had changed as time has passed, also the environment at Turing has also changed the way I interact with others, and how I utilize my skills. I am in a phase of learning and not in an environment I can emerge as anything other than a supporter and participant. https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown Storytelling and strengths was fun. I found a commonality with a member of my cohort I admire as a hard worker and smart person. He and I shared a love for Rocky and a champion for the underdog. He and I feel similarly about the two of us being unlikely heroes or potentially the heroes of our own stories. I also found a reconnection to my own story and ideologies about my family, my upbringing, and my identity. https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown Debugging the gender code was a great video to watch. There was a quote from the film, "It will be very hard to do something unless you see someone who looks like you doing it." This rings very true for me. I feel additionally challenged because I am a woman, and I am also Black. I am concerned about how I will be perceived and if I will be well received in my work environments after graduation. However I am additionally inspired to learn this craft well, and teach other people who have an interest in coding, particularly underrepresented groups in tech.


## E: Community Participation
I was a part of the Armstrong posse and went to those spikes. I was also able to help speak to new people interested in pursuing Turing. 

### Playing a Part

This module I was a part of the Armstrong posse. I felt comfortable enough in myself to participate in the greater community here. I also felt a sense of comfort in helping other students acclimate to the different learning environment that Turing provides.
