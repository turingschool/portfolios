# (Dan Alvarez) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(I really wanted to get a strong foundation of understanding for code. I wanted to be able to read code. As well I wanted to be able to look up syntax and apply it based on examples given.)

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3 I feel the consistent feedback I am receiving is that I am thinking and problem solving correctly, however I need more practice with syntax. I make small mistakes, once they are pointed out, I completely understand why it is a mistake and how to fix it.
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3, I felt I was able to apply the lessons learned to achieve the end goal, however there were areas where I could refactor my code to be cleaner. I also felt that I would focus on certain sections of my static comps, but as a result I would overlook a detail in another section.m
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3, I felt that I worked well with others, I was able to learn from them and them from me. I would say similarly to my individual projects, I would focus on certain functionality and not enough on refactoring.
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
I really enjoyed all of our gear ups. I think that everyone was very accepting of the theme of each gear up. Which really helped everyone be honest with our participation. Each lesson seems to play a huge part of our personal career development.
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 4
I tried to be involved with my classmates whenever possible. Any opportunity to learn or tutor one another was crucial for my development in this mod. I would say I feel like this mod went really well. I only wish our quizes were not on the same day that our big projects are due. Also getting our scores back from our quizlettes and projects would be more helpful so we could be more aware of what we need to work on.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects were Number Guesser, Linked-List, Idea-Box, To Do List, and the 3 Static Comps. Each were progressively more intricate and more detailed. I enjoyed all of them. I think it was especially enjoyable to look back and see how far we've come in a short time. From designing a simple Random Number game to being able to make a To Do box generator that save the information locally to that machine is pretty amazing.

### Projects

(Intro)

#### (Static Comp 1)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/DA-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This project was a lot of fun. It was also our opportunity to use flexbox, and make our sites responsive. It was also very eye opening because little details like color can make the website significantly more appealing.

(From memory: I could have made the icons and text more uniform. I could have made the responsive interface more appealing as far as spacing and margins. In the responsive I kept the space between and icon and text and as a result it makes it harder for the user to understand they are related.)

(evaluation scores: N/A Good Job, good use of color, could have used spacing to make the page clearer.)

#### (Static Comp 2)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/Static2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This project was much like the first one but slightly more intricate. I enjoyed making the cards responsive, especially making them unique but uniform in design. It was also a lot more fun to get real creative with the images and layout.

(From memory: I could have had a better use of color. My hover states were too different from the original state. As a result it made some display issues that I had not thought of. I could not get my local font library connected into my html file. Lastly i had not paid attention to the links, I didn't make the link different from the default settings.)

(evaluation scores: N/A Good Job, could go over a few more of the details and refactor the hover states.)

#### (Static Comp 3)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/Static-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

Static Comp 3 was the most difficult of the three. There were many details that were hard to navigate. I actually felt the best about this static comp as opposed to the last two. Mainly because I felt I had a better understanding of how to manipulate the page.

(From memory: All in all very good. There were a few areas that could be touched up. One was a hover color choice, it did not connect with any other part of the page so the color choice seems less intentional. The positioning of my social media icons were off. Instead of using flex box, I need to make it a inline display with hard margins. Lastly in my responsive, i made the tabs into buttons for the user's sake, but my design of the button could have been more unique from the grey background section. AS well i gave them a blue border which stood out on the page since it was never repeated.)

(evaluation scores:N/A Very good, just in need of some fine tuning.)

#### (Number Guesser)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/Random-Number-Game)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

The random number guessing game generates a random number between 1 and 100, It has an input field for the user to guess, if the guess is too high, the interface will say "Your guess was {whatever their guess was} that was too high!" and if the guess was too low the interface would say, "Your guess was {whatever their guess was} that was too high!".

(Good job, is in a good place to refactor. It's great to see how excited and passionate you are about learning to write code effectively. -Louisa)

(Proficient: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three)

## C: Group Work & Projects


#### (Linked-List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/Linked-List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked list was our first pairing project. The end goal was a bookmark card generator. It taught us about DOM manipulation and with event listeners and prepending functions. It was also very insightful to work in a pair. It taught me that sometimes I need to work with the person and make sure they are understanding what is going on, and not just steam roll the project.

(Slightly buggy on the remove all read if things are already deleted. -Brenna)

(Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.)

(Dan, I really enjoyed working on the link-list project with you. I feel we made a good team, even though I didn't provide a lot of help in the JavaScript/jQuery portion of the project. From the beginning, we were on the same page with availability, what our plans/vision was, and our strengths/weaknesses. I also appreciate you showing me your techniques and providing me some knowledge of how your JS/jQuery code was designed and what they were doing. I definitely feel like we were a good team and the project went very smoothly, but for the sake of growth as a team member and all, I'll provide you with some feedback that may be useful in the future.  I realize you had to do most, if not all of the user interface of the project, but maybe we could have busted more of that part of the coding out together. I wish I could provide you with more feedback, and I wish I could have provided more assistance with the heavy lifting. It was a pleasure working with you Dan.  I learned a lot from you, the project, and the experience as a whole. I hope we can collaborate on a project in the future again soon! Deuces, Erik)

#### (Idea-Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/Idea-Box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Idea-Box was our introduction into local storage. It was great to see a project that incorporated the css and javascript together. As well starting to use JQuery was great because it made functionality smoother, or at least writing it went smoother. This was also the second pairing project and my partnership with Travis went extremely well. I feel we had open lines of communication, a good understanding of how we wanted to work together, and we executed our plan well. Because both our main goals were to get the thing running before we make it look pretty, it is understandable that refactoring was our big downfall in the evaluation.

(Significant refactoring necessary)

(All main functionality done)

(I had a blast working with you Dan. I loved the constant communication we had and I really appreciated the fact that you respect my time. Whenever we worked, we worked hard. It was super satisfying. I also want to say that I really appreciate your patience with me especially when it came to the localStorage part in our code and how you were using a counter to define each individual idea. I know it took me a while to understand it, but it was really helpful that you continued to explain it to me and even let me explain it through a couple times to you to make sure I was understanding it correctly. You were an awesome partner.
If I have one bit of advice to offer, I would say maybe next time you work with a partner, if you get some advice from your brother, see if your partner can sit in on the conversation.  That way they don't have to play catchup later.  Rather, they can hear the same awesome feedback your brother gave you.  Otherwise though, again, I really had a great time working with you and look forward to working with you again in the future.)

#### (To Do Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/2-do-box-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

To Do Box was our third pairing project. Jack and I really meshed well. We both set out with goals in mind, and both parties were 100% on board with the others ideas. We were both positive and when we got stuck we both went and sought out help from Mod 4 which in turn had us cruising through the remaining functionality. Refactoring someone else's code was interesting, however we tried to build off their code instead of taking ownership and rewriting the code that we thought made the pivot more difficult.

(Some missed refactoring opportunities, overall good work but could have polished the codebase a bit more and really taken advantage of the opportunity to correct choices in the code that were not ideal. -Louisa)

(N/A)

(Danny Boy! It was great working on this project with you. It was really nice to work with you because I really look up to you as a developer and as a person. I think you have such an incredible attitude when it comes to developing yourself, not just developing software. I did feel that in the evaluation you dominated a little bit during the explanation of the javaScript. I think that I was probably self-conscious about it because my ideabox left things to be desired and I wanted more of an opportunity to express my proficiency. In the future, I'd encourage you to be conscious of your partner's need to prove their understanding/proficiency as well as your own during the actual evaluation. Besides that, I couldn't have asked for a better partner. I think that we worked well together and I liked that when one of us came up with a new idea we were both 100% down to try it. I look forward to getting to see you grow as a developer and getting to know you better as a person. -Jack)

## D: Professional Skills
The professional skills taught at turing have been extremely eye opening. At first they felt like a distraction from our coding lessons. However after this first mod, I feel like each Gear Up's message is extremely valuable for our career growth.

### Gear Up
#### (Growth Mindset)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/Growth-Mindset)

(The growth mindset gear up was really interesting because it made me look back at my entire schooling career. Since an early age I was always taught that getting the right answer was more important than truly understanding the topic. However, truly understanding the topic means that you have actually learned the topic. I like the idea of not stopping your learning just because you have the answer you need but keep learning so you will know the right answer in the future.)

### Gear Up
#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/Getting-Better-at-Difficult-Things/blob/master/readme.md)

I found this Gear Up was extremely helpful for my study and work habits. Knowing how to deal with overwhelming tasks and how to break down the problem into smaller problems that you can mostly solve then makes the giant problem into a smaller manageable task. I found this specifically helpful when approaching the static comp 3 project.

### Gear Up
#### (Strengths and Storytelling)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/Story-Telling/blob/master/readme.md)

Strengths and story telling seemed a little awkward when the gear up started but it soon became a great lesson in relating to my fellow student. Even though all of us came from different backgrounds and have different inspirations we all have some way of connecting and relating to one another. Not to mention how informational it was for future interviews and how to tell my story to inspire others to invest in me.

### Gear Up
#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/Gender-Gap/blob/master/readme.md)

This gear up was the most eye opening and inspiring gear up. I was completely unaware of the blatant sexism in the coding industry. It also made me think back to a student's lightning talk about we can't make the ipod before we get the technology to of the battery used to power the ipod. A big debate about hiring more women in programming is that we should hire the best possible candidate. However like the ipod needing the battery before we can make the ipod out of the best parts, we can't be expected to hire the best candidate, if our field of applicants doesn't include the best individuals. So we need more women and minorities in the tech industry otherwise how will we ever know if we have hired the best candidate out there.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(I tried to be apart of posses and extra curricular activities with classmates. This helped me meet other coders, especially in the back end program. As well our class decided to come in on the weekends at specific times so we could all help each other with any issues we may be having. I also enjoyed asking my fellow students for help to see their methods. As well I found it very flattering when other students came to me for help throughout this mod. Even when I couldn't help them it made me feel that I was approachable and understanding the code well enough to help others.)
