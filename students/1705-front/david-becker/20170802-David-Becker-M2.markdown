# David Becker - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

There were many things I was focused on for this module. The first was trying to focus on collecting my thoughts so that when I went to write code
I knew exactly what I needed to write before I even tried. The other big goal was to learn to be more efficient and organized in writing code. I think both of these things have improved greatly much to the benefit of 
working on paired projects where I was really forced to check these things constantly.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)
I felt like I aced it (for the most part)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

During this module, we had 4 projects: Game-Time, Sorting Suite, Complete-Me, and Weathrly. Game-Time and Weathrly were paired projects and Sorting Suite and Complete-Me were individual projects.

#### (Sorting Suite)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/davidbecker6081/sorting-algorithms)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

The project assignment was to build 4 sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.

This project was actually one of my favorite. I enjoyed the puzzle that needed to be solved in each sorting algorithm. The feedback that I recieved mostly was about simple refactoring that could make the code just a tiny bit more efficient.

[Eval Scores] Pass/Fail - Pass

#### (Complete-Me)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/davidbecker6081/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

The project assignment was to build an autocomplete feature using a Prefix Trie.

Once again, the major comments I recieved were for simple refactoring that could have been done. My complete-me worked decently well and I received compliments for completely solving the select method on my own. Some other feedback I received was having a more in-depth testing suite and trying to refactor to SRF.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Projects included Game-Time and Weathrly. Both projects were week and a half long timeframes.

#### (Game Time)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jackmallahan/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

The project assignment was to build a classic arcade game using ES6 Classes and utilize OOP.

Most of the comments revolved around UI fixes including making the playability a bit more user-friendly for starting and finishing the game. There were a few bugs that needed fixing which mostly had to do with the pause functionality during gameplay and between rounds.
We also got comments about consistency within our code including deciding on one thing over another such as arrow functions or not.

My partner's biggest piece of feedback to me was that I need to be a bit more comfortable taking the navigator seat. I definitely like to be the driver, but learning to be in the navigator position will also teach me to slow down a bit

#### (Weathrly)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/EndlessHypnosis/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

The project assignment was to learn React, Enzyme/Jest testing, and API calls by building out a weather application, which drew from the Weather Underground API. 

The bigges comments for this project were about our UI. Since we decided to focus more on the inner-workings of the code, we used our time more for learning React and how to test it, than building out a beautiful UI. Our UI was functional, but we lacked mobile responsiveness and great-looking color schemes. 

[Eval Scores]
## Specification Adherence - 3
## User Interface - 3
## HTML Style - 3.5 
## CSS/Sass Style - 3
## JavaScript / React Style - 3.5
## Testing - 4
## Workflow - 4

During the project we tried to give feedback as needed. Although I believe we worked well together by diving into one of our workstyles for the majority of the time. There were times where because we both are almost too confident in ourselves, we didn't necessarily immediately trust one another's solution. 

## D: Professional Skills
These Gear Up sessions were very helpful in thinking about both soft skills and how we as students will help change things that we see to be issues when we move into the developer workforce.

### Gear Up

#### (Being an Ally)

* [GitHub URL](
 https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)

During this session, allyship in both Turing and the developer world was incredibly important to changing issues. I have always felt that no matter then group of people, I've tried to empathize and understand where they are coming from. 
One of the consistent ideas that our group talked about, which I strongly feel is one of the most important, if not the most important, aspect of allyship, is understanding the side that you oppose. 
If I'm trying to become an ally for someone, the first thing to do is understand why you are taking a stance against the other side. Talk to the other side. Why are they saying/doing the things they are doing. Is it really meant in a bad way? Do they know what they're saying? 
These are things that I will continue to consider when allying with students or others in a workplace. 

#### (Empathy and Priviledge)

* [GitHub URL](
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

During this session, I was surprised at how many different experiences each of us has had and how much those things have affected and shaped us. This is a very hard session to have for a lot of people because many times, these experiences are kept to themselves and we were asked to share them and share how we felt about them. Empathy was vital in understanding and trying to connect with what people were sharing whether good or bad. 
One thing that I talked about, which definitely made me uncomfortable was priviledge that I have had over the course of my life. I haven't really ever had to completely fend for myself. I have been fortunate enough to be handed many things that other people have not had. But what I tried to convey, which is missed by a lot of people a lot of the time, is that priviledge does not mean you haven't worked hard to get where you are. 
I know that priviledge allows many things to happen that otherwise might not, but I think many times dedication and hard-work are swapped with priviledge. I'll continue, though, to think about how I can use the priviledge that I have to help others that might not. But i encourage others to not let priviledge blind the true character of a person.

#### (Mod 4 GearUp- Learning a New Language)

* [GitHub URL](
 https://github.com/VictoriaVasys/learning-a-new-language/)

I joined this session because I am always interested in new techniques for learning new things. One of the biggest takeaways from this session was that taking a project that you already know the structure/inner workings of and applying that to the new thing you are learning is one of the more effective ways to learn quickly and on a much deeper level. 
For instance, if you were trying to learn React, trying to implement a project that didn't use React would be an effective way to learn React. Finding the best resources is also a major component in learning something new. Both of these methods will be crucial in the next module when working on a personal project where I might be using or trying to do something that no one else around me can help with. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

The biggest way I supported the community this module was by trying to offer pairing sessions as much as possible. I strove to have at least 6 open pairing sessions a week and be available to help Module 1 when they needed direction in figuring out problems. 

### Pairing feedback:

Thanks for making so much time to pair with us and help out with Mythical Creatures! You really know your stuff and it provided technical help as well as emotional relief to know there was someone we trusted to point us in the right direction.

I really enjoyed pairing with you, David. You seemed really strong in javascript, and you really took the time to understand my code and try to work with my particular approach to each project. You were a bit difficult to understand at first, but as I grew in my own knowledge and you became more comfortable helping me, I feel like that dissipated significantly. Also, the occasional challenge of grasping what you were trying to communicate was one of the reasons I repeatedly signed up to pair with you. I feel like I definitely learned a lot from you each time. The one area you might have room for growth in is encouragement. While you were super-helpful in addressing the areas I needed work on in my projects, I felt like you could have better highlighted the things I did well and should continue doing. Overall, you were a delight to work with, and I look forward to more pairings with you in the future. 

It was highly beneficial pairing with David for a number of reasons. First off, I appreciated how he took a personalized approach by disseminating my code in terms of how we logically went about it. Second, his understanding of the material was apparent by the way he was able to articulate the concepts. Pairing with David helped a lot, thanks!
