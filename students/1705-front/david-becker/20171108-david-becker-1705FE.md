# Mod4 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

My main goal was to become comfortable with writing simple backends and being able to build full stack applications efficiently. Accomplished. Another goal was to kill it in the job hunt, which I think I've accomplished more than I thought I would, but I also hoped to be a bit further along.

#### Capstone Project - Pass

[Original Spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)

This project was a great way to see what we really knew. It was a cumulative project of everything we've learned in the last four mods: HTML, CSS, React/Redux, Node/Express, Firebase, CircleCI, and much more. I enjoyed this project a lot because it was not only a technical challenge getting everything talking to each other, but also because the group was enjoyable and educational to work with.


#### House of Vars - Pass

[Original Spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/house-of-vars.html)

Well if this didn't scare me off of working on an open-source project, I feel like I'm good to go. It was definitely a rollercoaster of a ride for a few days thinking we had solved something so easily, only to find out we didn't. To be honest, I can't say that I learned a whole lot from this project, but it was definitely a good experience. And it definitely makes me realize that I have A LOT to learn!
 
#### Palette Picker - Pass

The first week is always kind of a blur and extremely difficult. So was this project for me. I was in a constant state of confusion about node/express and writing API endpoints during this week. But after coming out of the project, I felt like I had a good general understanding of the way a backend was working. It was also awesome to have deployed an application, FINALLY! 

#### BYOB - Pass
[Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1705/mod-4/byob/TYLER-HEVIA_DAVID-BECKER.md)

[Github](https://github.com/davidbecker6081/BYOB)

[Original Spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/build-your-own-backend.html)

This project really helped solidify my understanding of writing a backend. The thing I felt most accomplished with in this project though was the web-scraping that Tyler and I did since we spent so much time trying to get it to work correctly. I honestly was pretty excited about coming out with a beautiful readme to show people. 

### Professional Development

##### Proffesional Story

who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.

I'm working on this. 

### Gear-up reflection

I thought that our gear-up went really well. It started a bit slow, but once everyone was on the same page, the conversations really got going. People had lots of good ideas for coding for social justice/movements. I enjoyed hearing everyone's ideas and passions. It was also great to actually get a physical deliverable at the end of the session, and I believe everyone in the gear-up also appreciated this greatly.
