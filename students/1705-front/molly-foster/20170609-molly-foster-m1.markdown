# Molly Foster - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In this module I set out to understand the fundamentals of front end development: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also wanted to develop a habit of studying and writing code every day to really solidify concepts and logic skills.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: Pass
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: Pass

## A: End of Module Assessment

I believe that I passed the end of mod assessment. I know that there are a couple of topics as noted by "Advanced Beginner" status and comments below that I need to dive a little deeper into and spend some time practicing, but I feel that I have a good grasp on things conceptually. I feel that these items are small gaps in knowledge that can be picked up on with a bit of awareness and effort.

### Optional Notes:

- odd syntax for passing in an object as a param
- seemed nervous/hesitant
- no issues with syntax, but seemed to struggle a bit with understanding the logic
- has her head around how to do the thing, just over thinks a bit and makes things harder on herself than it could be
- mostly just overthinking how complex things need to be, otherwise is good!
- good job!

### B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mollyfoz/num-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

In this project, we were instructed to build a number guessing game in which the user guesses a number between 1-100 and the application returns feedback to the user if the user guess is too high, too low, or correct. Additional functionality allows for the user to adjust the range to their liking, clear fields, and reset the game entirely.

### Evaluator: Brenna
### Optional Notes:
  - Started phase 3
  - Slightly buggy with the range input fields
  - Work on separating event listeners from the function they are firing off
  - Clean up indentation a little bit when working with sibling elements
  - Pull out larger functions into more bite size pieces and reduce some duplication
  - Avoid grabbing the value of an input field on page load unless you're actually using that value at that time. Typically you'll only want that value after an event fires - like a button click.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tylerjhevia/Linked-List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

In this paired project, we created a small application that creates a website bookmark using input from a user. The user would input a title and URL for the desired bookmark, and the application would append that bookmark to a new section of the page. Additional functionality includes marking a bookmark as read, deleting it from the page, a counter to display the number of total bookmarks, read bookmarks, and unread bookmarks, as well as a button to remove all read bookmarks from the display.

#### Feedback: 
Great job on the project! I think it went really well. We are both kind of quiet people, but I think we communicated pretty well throughout the project, especially in the last few days.  We also did a good job of not getting too stressed out, which can be tough when we're getting so much new stuff thrown at us every day. We had some early trouble with GitHub, but I think we mostly had it figured out by the time we finished. One thing that I think we could have done better is doing more paired work. We decided in the beginning to divide up a lot of the work, which worked out fine, but I think I learned the most while we were working together trying to figure out how to do the counter stuff.  Anyways, thanks for being a great partner, I had a lot of fun working with you!

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rburnette3/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

For this project, we created an application that utilized local storage to store a user's ideas. The user would input their idea title and description into a form and create an idea card that would append to another part of the page. Additional functionality includes changing the quality of the idea and deleting the idea card from the page all while updating local storage so that the user's changes persist on page reload. A search function was also employed that allowed the user to filter through the cards and append only the cards that met the search criteria to the page.

#### Feedback: 
Hi there Molly, I wanted to let you know that I really enjoyed working with you on ideabox. From the beginning, on that first Saturday I feel as though we were off to a great start. When we were working together on the HTML/CSS layout I liked how we analyzed the comp and recreated it almost exactly by bouncing ideas off of each other. I really learn well when I can openly discuss things with others and you were extremely helpful in promoting that. Even when we were stuck on certain aspects of the project you were very encouraging with the conversation we had as we worked through the different problems. Some areas were more complex than others but I am really happy about how we were able to arrive at solutions. I also think you did an outstanding job during the eval speaking on the concepts and logical thinking of the javascript. If there is one bit of advice I could give you in working on team and solo projects it would be to not get too frustrated when the first tries are not successful. Lets face it, this is stuff is hard! Sometimes its best to walk away and come back with a clear head and a new approach. Thank you for all your help! I really learned a lot from working with you on this project. I hope we can come together on another in the future.

#### 2DoBox-Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mollyfoz/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

For this project, we were given a completed(mostly) code base to refactor and turn into a new application along the same lines as IdeaBox- the user would create a task or todo and set the priority. The user's changes should all persist in local storage and update as they change the contents or priority of the card. Additional functionality allowed the user to mark a task as complete, filter cards shown by pressing buttons that matched the priority of the todo, hide completed cards, and show completed cards.

### Evaluator: Louisa
### Optional Notes:

Good job! Very nicely done, great team work, really captured the spirit of refactoring a codebase.

#### Feedback:
It was great working with you Molly. It was good to have someone to bounce ideas off of and talk through logic with. I appreciate your dedication to our project and all the hard you put in. It was good having the conversation with you about the project already and would work with you again anytime. For some coaching feedback I could say, if anything, that it seemed at times that you wanted to say something or had a thought and then maybe realized that the idea wouldn't work so didn't say anything. Even if that idea might not work, share it anyway because in talking it out something might click or lead to another idea.

### D: Professional Skills

#### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

The growth mindset gear up really resonated with me. I grew up with a fixed mindset, in a fixed mindset environment. It definitely made me reconsider a lot of the things that I believed about myself, like what I was or wasn't good at and my own potential. I've been trying to keep it in mind over the last few weeks especially when things weren't clicking immediately or when I was really frustrated. It has helped to keep my outlook (mostly) positive, especially since I generally tend to be negative and really hard on myself.

#### Gear Up
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

This gear up helped me to be more cognizant of how I am using my cognitive resources and making sure that I am timeboxing when I run into problems. I have definitely run into these issues in the last few weeks and I made sure that I was using my cognitive resources to learn as much as possible and not worry about things that I don't need to worry about. I have caught myself losing track of time on issues, and I made sure to get a pomodoro timer for my phone to remind me not to get lost and waste time. I have also found it really helpful to break problems down a little at a time instead of getting ahead of myself and feeling overwhelmed by a large problem.

#### Gear Up
#### Working With Introverts, Extroverts, and Ambiverts

I found this gear up to be really eye opening and I think it was really valuable in understanding how I work and how to better work with others. It was brought to my attention that extroverts might need to talk more or find more of a need to talk things out initially to fully grasp the problem or task that they are dealing with, which is the exact opposite of how I grasp information. A person in my group used a really good analogy about how an introvert trying to think is like holding sand, and as soon as you are interrupted or someone starts talking to you, the sand starts to slip through your fingers and the process of understanding is interrupted. Understanding my own learning and others learning can help us pair and work through issues with consideration for their learning style and facilitate good collaboration.

#### Gear Up
#### Strengths & Storytelling

I thought that this gear up was good to create empathy and understanding in the community. Everyone's stories are different, but we are all here now because we needed/wanted a change in our lives. And we are now all going through the thing together. Keeping in mind that we have things in common will help us to support each other in the community, even though we might have different values.

#### Gear Up
#### Debugging The Gender Gap

This gear up was honestly pretty shocking. As a woman, it scared me a little to realize that sexism is still an issue in tech and that it is a very real possibility that I could end up in an environment like that. I was also really surprised to learn that so few public schools have CS classes, and that so few women hold CS degrees, even though women hold more bachelor's degrees overall. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

In this mod, I went to a couple of guest speaker talks and participated in two mod-1/mod-2 meetups and one mod-1 meetup. I also spent a lot of time at school after hours- just being there to work with my cohort was always helpful so that we could bounce ideas off of each other and collaborate. I did not join a posse this mod due to being a little overwhelmed, but definitely have interest to join a posse and be a little more involved in the community next mod.
