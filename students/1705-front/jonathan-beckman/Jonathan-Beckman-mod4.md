## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Ways that I have been a part of the Turing community this mod are by being a part of SAB.  Listening to the collective feedback from each cohort is a unique window into the community that I get to see and then try to relay to my own cohort.  I have enjoyed being a part of Turing in this way.
