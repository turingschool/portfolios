# Margo Schaedel - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for mod 2 revolved mainly around solidifying my grasp of JavaScript fundamentals, particularly with regard to ES6 syntax.  Coincedentally, my time pairing with the mod 1 students allowed me to both give back to the Turing community and help others in their start here at Turing, and reinforce concepts integral to a solid foundation in JS.  In future, I will strive to strengthen my knowledge and experience with React.

## A: End of Module Assessment

PASSED

## B: Individual Work & Projects

For mod 2, we were tasked with two projects to take on individually.

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mschae16/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

This project involved the creation, completion, and understanding of bubbleSort, insertionSort, mergeSort, and quickSort algorithms.

Evaluator: Mike Limberg

Evaluation Score: PASSED

#### Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mschae16/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

This project delved into data structures, and involved implementing a prefix trie in order to set up a basic auto-complete system.

Evaluator: Nathaniel Foster

Scores:

1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style
   * 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
    
2. Test-Driven Development
   * 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to  test the functionality

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
   * 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Functional Expectations
   * 3.5: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Game-Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lcaroselli/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This project involved using the Canvas framework in order to create a basic version of the Frogger game, or in our particular case, Soot Sprint.

Evaluator: Mike Limberg

Scores:

1. Functional Expectations
   * 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

2. User Interface
   * 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

3. Testing
   * 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

4. JavaScript Style
   * 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

5. Workflow
   * 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

6. Code Sanitation - The output from JSHint shows…
   * 4 - Zero complaints

#### Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mschae16/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

This project was our first foray into using React. We built a weather app in React and completed all testing using Jest and Enzyme.

Evaluator: Nathaniel Foster

Scores:

1. Specification Adherence
   * 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

2. User Interface
   * 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

3. HTML Style
   * 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

4. CSS/Sass Style
   * 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

5. JavaScript / React Style
   * 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

6. Testing
   * 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

7. Workflow
   * 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

8. Code Sanitation - The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…
   * 4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Empathy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

In this gear up session, we all had a chance to reflect on our personal experiences, and examine different ways in which we may be marginalized or experience privilege in our society . We had a chance to share our experiences with members of our groups and also time to reflect individually on how we can continue to make connections and espouse empathy, even if we have experienced privilege or been marginalized, or been perpetrators of that behaviour to others in the past. I found this session really interesting over all, especially in having the chance to hear so many varied experiences and perspectives, which may have otherwise been overlooked.

### Gear Up
#### Allyship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)

I found the gear up session on Allyship to be quite intriguing, especially with regards to the concept of assuming allyship as an ongoing, continual process to operate in solidarity with groups that are marginalized in society.  I think it is a particularly important point that it is the responsibility of those with privilege to educate themselves first and form relationships afterwards.  Having the chance to speak to other members in my group about the four different scenarios truly shed light on how varied opinions are in this topic and how to approach Allyship whether you are a person of privilege or identify with those who are marginalized.

### Gear Up
#### The Attention Economy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1706-inning/group_two.md)

I really enjoyed this gear up session on the most valuable commodity in our day and age: attention (and time).  In this gear up, led by a group of mod 4 students, we had the opportunity to watch an illuminating video on how technology is designed specifically to attract our attention and use our time.  In a world of infinite information, the more time that one spends using a particular application results in a direct link to greater revenues for companies, so it is in their best interest to design apps to encourage you to remain glued to theirs in particular.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod I made a conscientous effort to get to know my classmates and people of the greater Turing community, particularly with regard to pairing with mod 1 students.  Pairing was so beneficial for me in mod 1 that I really tried to make myself available for mod 1 students to answer any questions, help them with their projects, and go over fundamental concepts with them in prep for the Pentathlon.  I received the following as feedback from pairing sessions with several mod 1 students.

I set a goal for my pairing to understand Git and maybe touch on CSS. After pairing with Margo, I have a functional understanding of local git repositories and have used them in my Number Guesser project. Margo used the Mod1 git lesson as a basis for our discussion. It's a solid tutoring technique: referencing available materials for guided self/partner-learning. Margo offered to spend part of her lunch working with my CSS since we ran out of time going through git. I fell into my project and forgot to connect with her for more help. Solid pairing experience!

Margo was a phenomenal tutor, we met at 8 am before class on Friday 7/7/17. She helped me clean up and refactor the javascript for my random number generator. She is able to convert complicated terms and concepts into easy to digest bits. Thank you Margo for all you help!

You were able to provide feedback without telling me what to do precisely, which was helpful in helping me solve problems on my own, especially when working on mythical creatures. I got very specific feedback on my static comp that took my project from good to great, and I appreciated the directness of the feedback on the static comp. At times we were moving pretty fast during our pairing, and I believe it would be help to continue honing your skill to recognize where slowing down and diving into concepts is needed.

My pairing session with you was great. I was feeling a bit overwhelmed this afternoon before sitting down with you. You did a great job at explaining different aspects of the code base and how I could change things around. I liked how you double checked that I understood changes that we were making. I now have a better understanding of this project in general. I can't think of anything that you could have done better. Thanks for your time!

It was very nice pairing with you. My favorite part about our session was accomplishing so much in so little time. You were organized on how to tackle each part I needed to get through. Something else that was really nice of you to do, was reaching out beforehand to confirm our meeting. Again, thank you for meeting with me.
