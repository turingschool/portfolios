## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

FANTASTIC JOB!! Totally unusable as an Actual Thing, but REALLY REALLY FUN AND GOOD!!! I'm so happy to see you this excited and so willing to try new things and experiment. You've done a great job, I'm so glad that you're enjoying yourself and learning so much. You've made a ton of progress.

### Functional Expectations

* __Advanced Beginner:__  Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Proficient:__ Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Proficient__ : Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

#### Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Conditional Logic

* __Exceptional__ Can write conditional logic that is succinct and easy to read. Logic can handle all situations where user gives incorrect/unexpected input.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Exceptional__ Comfortable with using callback functions where applicable. Comfortable returning collections from functions (objects, arrays).

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Exceptional__ Understands the potential performance impact imposed by leveraging vanilla JavaScript vs. jQuery in their implementation and will make choices accordingly based on the problem to solve.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

I can't really grade this category for this particular project with this rubric because the final implementation used the comp as, ahem, "inspiration" rather an a guide. It was  very funny and clever, but not very usable. It *was* responsive, which is awesome.

#### Comp Recreation
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint



## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### (Link List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jackmallahan/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

With a little jQuery under your belt, it’s time to try your hand at building a small application.

In it’s simplest form, the application should have the following:

Two input fields
One for the title of the bookmark
One for the URL that the bookmark should link to
One button for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page
A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display:
The title of the bookmark
The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL)
A button to “Mark as Read”
A button to “Remove” the bookmark

## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

Through phase 4

Nicely done! Really good job, good distribution of

UI is a little bit too wide on big screens, so have a max-width that kicks in to control line lengths.


### Functional Expectations

* __Exceptional__ You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Conditional Logic

|Proficient         | Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.|

#### Functions & Scope

|Proficient         | Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.|


#### DOM Manipulation

|Proficient         | Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.|

## GIT & GITHUB

|Proficient         | Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.|

#### Github

Use pull requests!

|Advanced Beginner  | Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.|


## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

|Proficient         | Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticable and/or unintuative than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.|


## PAIRING

#### Collaboration

|Exceptional        | Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.|

#### (Idea Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jasonlucas907/idea-box-1705)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jasonlucas907/2DoBox-Pivot-1705)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Do you remember that project IdeaBox?…

We thought they were pretty great, but, we think it’s time to pivot those projects over to something we like to call 2DoBox.

You will be inheriting someone’s previous IdeaBox and pivoting it over to 2DoBox.
