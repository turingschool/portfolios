HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.

You will start the project by importing files containing various educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district.

In the spirit of TDD we have created some unit tests for you to start off with. These tests will help you break out calculation logic into a DistrictRepository class. After you finish iteration 1 you'll move on to creating the rest of the react application on your own, with the expectation that you will continue to test the application on your own.

This application was built using the create-react-app boilerplate. This boilerplate provides a lot of build in content and dependencies for free. Take a few minutes to read through the documentation, and remember to refer back to these docs if you run into unexpected issues.

# Comments:

## Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes 5 iterations.

## Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.


## PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

## CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.

## Testing

- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing



# SWAPI Box

* [SWAPI Box)](https://github.com/jasonlucas907/swapi-box)
* [Original SWAPI Box Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

For this project, we are going to work on developing some muscle memory building out React components. At this point you’ve built at least one basic React app in the past. Now’s the time to leverage that and add some complexity.

For this project, we will be hitting The Star Wars API to tap into a “black hole” of Star Wars data. Mwahaha.

# Movie Tracker

* [Movie Tracker](https://github.com/anajauregui/Movie-Tracker)
* [Original Movie Tracker Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

This project is working off the The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api - note you'll need to go create an account to get an API key). The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies. Pretty simple right? HA HA not!

Bc this is still in beta here is what you'll need to know.

**MOVIE SPEC**:

### Specification Adherence  

* 3.5: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.


### JavaScript Style

* 3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


### Testing

<!-- * 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application using Enzyme. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application including the Redux actions and reducers.
* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.
* 2: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
* 1: There is little or no evidence of testing in this application. -->

### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Being an ally

* [Allyship](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)

This gear up session helped me explore scenerios where in which I might not have recognized or acted on the
opprotunity to be an ally to someone that was being discriminated against.

### Gear Up
#### Empathy and Privilege

* [empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

I learned about how easy it is to be unaware of your own privledge.  One big take away I had was "You studied the culture of your
ancestors in elementary school."   I never thought about how it may feel to be the minority or the only one in a class room
whos ancestors culture was not reviewd or perhaps not reviewed in a good light.
