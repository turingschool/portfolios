# Bret Doucette - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

For this module, I wanted to focus on how I tackled problems. A lot of stress from module one was related to me doubting myself and being  hard on myself. To combat this, I tried to become better at not becoming overwhelmed when facing difficult problems or when working with people that solved problems quicker. I improved but still struggled. My strategy was to focus on small problems; breaking them into logical components instead of focusing on the entire problem.

I also wanted to improve my public speaking abilities so I gave two lightning talks and volunteered to be one of the leaders for 1508's student orientation

### Work

In module two, I completed the following individual work:

#### Robot World

**Feedback to me**

Holzmann - "Bret is very organized and super fun to work with. He was the glue that held our little team together and made sure that we delivered the final product when we needed to. One of Bretâ€™s biggest strengths was being able to figure things out on his own. I could always trust him to figure out how to do something. An area for improvement would be take more breaks."

Pease - "It was impressive watching Bret work during Traffic Spy.  His ability to learn new information on the fly was pretty cool to see.  He was positive and supportive the entire time.  I honestly don't think I have seen him in a bad mood over the last 2 modules which is really beneficial to the people around him.""

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TeamConchord/earmarked)
* [Original Assignment Guideline](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

**Description**

In this eleven day project, we built a Ruby on Rails Application that allows issue specific donating in the 2016 Presidential Election.

Per our About Page:

"Earmarked is a tool that will revolutionize how people donate to presidential elections. Earmarked is unique because it allows users to donate to specific issues in each candidate's campaign. Do you like Hillary Clinton's stance on the environment? Donate to just that part of her campaign. Would you like to see each candidate's stance on the economy? Browse the Issues Section to see what each candidate thinks."

**Personal Comments**

The Good

* Building the site was a blast and we did extremely well on our review.
* Learning some front-end Javascript and styling. Learning new Active Record queries.
* Learning Rails topics on my own.

The Bad

* Poor communication during the middle of our project

**Evaluation Comments**

Notes:

* Got testing with Selenium working - very cool
* Site looks great.
* Implemented Stripe and Twilio as extensions

Scores:

* 1. Feature Completeness: 4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions
* 2. Views: 3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through
* 3. Controllers: 4: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack
* 4. Models: 3: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring
* 5. Testing: 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels
* 6. Usability: 4: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers
* 7. Work-flow: 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

**Feedback to me**

Haby - Bret was a really great team team member to work with. He had an extremely high work ethic during our project and was highly accountable for the quality of his code and his workflow. Bret also paired really well, and was very communicative during sessions with trying to unravel complex problems. I think one area for growth might be a little more patience for dealing with challenging group dynamics when other group members were disrupting his workflow, etc. I would absolutely want to be in a group with Bret again!

## Community

### Giving Feedback

After our first group project, we had group retros where we discussed the highs and lows of the project. During this session, I gave feedback.

### Playing a Part

* Volunteered for New Student Orientation for 1508.

* Git Helper - helped various students from 1508 with understanding the basics of Git.

* Organized a Friday talk with Stewart Fortier, CTO of MassRoots.

* Gave two lightning talks on the fun world of travel credit cards.
