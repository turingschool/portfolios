# Alexis Uriel Navarrete - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission
I came to Turing to finally be in a place where I can learn not just from the staff but from the students as well.

I'm finally in a position in life where I am not the top one in my class which means there's always something new to learn! I'm thankful that I get to experience this growth at such a young age which wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for me being a student in Turing.

In this module I came to test my abilities as a student and an indiviual by placing myself in an environment filled with hard working people. By placing myself in this environment, I've learned a lot about how there's a lot more work to do if I want to achieve my life goals.

### End of Module Assessment
**Challenge: None (Repeating Module 1)**

### Projects
Below is a collection of all the projects and assessment scores from Module 1.

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Salvi6God/Jungle_Beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/a0ccb625762f2ead4d0bcf554c88daeda1784eea/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

This project's emphasize was to learn how to implement linked list's by mixing sounds to our code. This program was challenging because in the beginning I thought that the only way for Ruby to have a collection of information was by containing it within an array. Yet, I discovered that that is not true at all.

Assessed By: Mike

#### Notes:

* Be careful with your indentation.
* Project did not return number of beats when played.
* One failing test.
* 12 tests

### Scores:

* Overall Functionality: 1
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3

#### Engima

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Salvi6God/Enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/enigma.html)

This project was inspired by Alan Turing so it's only natural for us as students to at least do something about him! This challenged me by really thinking about the small steps that needed to be taken into consideration before starting. From the input/output keys to the character mapping it really was something new that I hadn't expected. At least it was fun to do!

Instructor: Mike

### Comments:

* 13 tests.
* no extensions completed
* Enigma class was a God class
* tests could use better structure
* there were opportunities for better testing, more unittesting *
### Scores:
* 1. Overall Functionality (1 - 4) 1
* 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style (1 - 4) 2
* 3. TDD (1 - 4)
* 4. Breaking Logic Into Components __(1 - 4)__2

#### HTTP...Yeah You Know Me!

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Salvi6God/http_yeah_you_know_me)
* [Original Assignment]()

This project is second to being the most challenging one I've done being right behind Headcount. I hope to review it soon during my intermission week or at least read more about the material since I didn't complete it.

Group: Lenny & Alex

Assessed By: Horace

### Notes:

* Some initial progress on a procedural solution the problem
* Struggled to make layered progress on problem components, largely due to difficulties in applying dev processes a and techniques
* Struggled with outpacing feedback - no tests to provide feedback, seems to have led to difficulty understanding the progress that had been made thus far and the scope of the problem

### Scores:

* Overall Functionality 1: Application implements two or fewer iterations
* Fundamental Ruby & Style 2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
* Test-Driven Development 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
* Breaking Logic into Components 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

#### HeadCount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

### Giving Feedback
## Community

Hector Huertas Baeza: "Besides being the only person I speak Spanish with, Hector is an excellent person when it comes to his work ethic. I remember that he was going through some housing issues as well and still managed to balance it all out."

Toni Rib: "Toni is by far one of the dopest people I have ever met! I think that it's so cool how she explained the String Theory and Theory of Relativity to me a couple weeks ago. I guess it goes to show that her communication skills are really on point. So if you end up reading this always remember that your biggest rival is your UCLA alternate universe self."

Admir Draganovic: "Although we ended up not working together for our Headcount project, I'm glad it happened. Our  conversations and situation taught me how there's still a lot to learn in programming. It showed my weaknesses and where I need to improve on for my future work."  

### Being a Community Member
"Alex brought excitement and enthusiasm to our project. As I stared at our assignment and felt a sinking feeling at my ability to comprehend the task at hand, Alex was sure we’d get there. When I got lost in the project and I couldn't figure out how to escape the hole I had for myself, Alex was there cheering me on. Despite the late refocus on the project and the accompanying failing grade, the progress that was made was significantly the result of Alex’s infectious enthusiasm. To offer one point of criticism, I would suggest that if Alex learns to channel his enthusiasm toward the next most immediate task at hand he will grow into a formidable developer. I look forward to watching that growth happen."-- Lenny Myerson

### Playing a Part
I believe the biggest way I have contributed to the community this module was by volunteering to talk about my experience in Turing to the high school students. Being in that event was pretty cool because they weren't that much younger than me and it reminded me from when I was in high school. I'm glad I was part of the event because I got to see the faces of how interested some of the kids were. I even got to talk to some of them in private while I was upstairs in the lobby which got me to really get my message across.
