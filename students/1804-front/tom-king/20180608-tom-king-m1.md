# Tom King - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for Module 1 include becoming proficient in Javascript, HTML/CSS, and Communication.
I came in to Turing with some experience in HTML and CSS, so my primary goal for Module 1 was to aquire a working knowledge of JavaScript, writing code that firstly works and then making it pretty; secondary to that I wanted to spruce up my CSS skills to make responsive layouts; and lastly, but not least, I wanted to become a better communicator, collaborator, and supporter of my team.

### Projects

Individual Projects Include:

* Number Guesser
* Static Comp 1
* Static Comp 2
* Static Comp 3

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tomkingkong/Number-Guesser)
* [GitHub Pages](https://tomkingkong.github.io/Number-Guesser/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was our only individual project that contained Javascript. The static comps we had to do were mainly html and css. For the number guesser project, we created a simple webpage layout for users that guess a number between 1 and 100. As you go further in the phases, there are more steps added in, for example, have the user specify the range themselves and not have it set to be 1 to 100. Our concentration in the static comp projects are to recreate a layout given to us, but while keeping the same structure. We also had to make the webpage responsive to all screen sizes.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

* Linked List
* Ideabox
* To Do Box Pivot

  * The group projects consisted of 3 paired programming assignments: Linked List, IdeaBox, and ToDoBox. Each project expanded on the previous and added new features requiring us to expand our javascript, jQuery, and html/css skills. The final paired project, ToDoBox, was an interesting exercise in which we were given another group's IdeaBox project and tasked with parsing, re-factoring, and adding new features to effectively pivot the IdeaBox to the ToDoBox theme without scraping the original code base.

##### Evaluator: David Whitaker

###### Feedback from Partner 
Tom is a super nice guy with lots of energy and positive enthusiasm.  He spends a lot of time on his work and it shows. As Tom knows (from conversations we had), sometimes he needs to take more breaks and come back to things with a fresh mind.  His determination and drive are exceptional, they'll be even more productive with consistent breaks that allow for fresh perspectives.

##### Functional Expectations

* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

##### HTML

######  Accessibility

* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

###### Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

##### CSS

###### Structure of Code

* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

###### Implementation

* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

##### JAVASCRIPT

###### Data Types

* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

###### Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

###### Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

###### Arrays

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

###### Objects & Prototypes

* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

###### DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

###### Style

* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

##### GIT & GITHUB

###### Git

* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

###### Github

* Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.
* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

##### DESIGN

###### Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

##### PAIRING

###### Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

##### TERMINOLOGY

###### Technical Vocab

* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.

##### Evaluator: Nathaniel Foster

###### Feedback from Partner 
Tom, I learned an unbelievable amount from you while we were working on the project together; Not only about the project itself but about life, mindsets, positive thinking as well as some technical aspects of general front-end knowledge and essential skillsets. I have an intangible amount of gratitude for your patience, encouragement and general confidence with what we had to do with the project as well as teaching me how to teach myself more and helping me pull myself out of some deep funks. It was the best paired project experience I've had so far at Turing and thanks for all of your help and staying collected while I was having some tough times. I really don't have any coaching feedback for you at all. You went above and beyond with the project and dealing with my shortcomings and I'm sure it was a huge learning experience for us both. The only thing I would add is keep being open to other working styles and different types of people.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Health and Wellness

In this session we discussed different types of stress, their triggers, and indications. I've found that breathing steadily through difficult situations helps my mind to cope with moderate amounts of stress; also, taking frequent breaks during mental challenges and exercise greatly reduces the changes of becoming overloaded with stress.

#### Code 2.0

I learned in this session that diversity of perspective is crucial to quality products that benefit their users, especially if the creators of the product share nothing in common with the end user. I also learned to watch out for my own inherent biases, and to not assume someone else's story, but to instead ask about it. It was also interesting to talk to others about their history and what educations led them to become software developers.

#### MOD4 Gear Up - Treating Depression with Mobilie Apps

In this session Mod 4 students led us into a discussion surrounding depression and whether or not mobile applications were affecting their users mental state. I took the middle position on the topic as I believe applications are more of a catalyist than they are directly responsible for its users mental health; though I am in agreement that a good application should take into account how they can be triggering or enabling for those struggling with their mental health. Towards the end of the session we discussed applications that exist in the world, whose aim it is to support peoples mental health, and how we can improve upon these programs. The solution my group decided on was to ask users (in order to post) to rate their post on a scale of how they felt about the post, in order to tie their posts with their feelings and to provide information down the road about what they're posting and their mental health.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

As a new student I have been supporting the larger Turing community by spending time with other classmates to go over JS material, debug CSS and HTML, and push them to go beyond what they think is possible.
