# (Kiel Dehnert) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to learn the fundamentals and language of the three programs we will be using for the front end course. Coming in I had very little knowledge of coding, so I am very pleased with the progress I have made on the basic tools I will need to be successful throughout the later mods.

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I have always strived to be a team player. Having the distinct advantage of having a mentor and Turing graduate as a roomate has allowed me to start a tutoring session once a week with him that an increasing number of my cohort have begun attending. On top of that I have made sure to always lend a hand to those that haven't learned a certain thing that I have, and I have always asked for guidance when someone has knowledge that I have not learned yet. I also have worked on recruiting my friends from Oklahoma, so we might just get some new recruits out of that!
