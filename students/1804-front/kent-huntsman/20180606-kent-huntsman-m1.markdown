# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
  I wanted to get better at html, css and javascript this mod and I feel that I accomplished that by following the feedback from my instructors from my first time through mod one. I feel that I made steady progress in all aspects of the material in mod one, but could have done more with passing objects through functions.  I spent a lot of time mentoring fellow cohort mates in DOM manipulation as that is what I was asked to help with most often.  As much as I enjoy helping others learn and learning myself by the process of teaching, I pigeon holed myself by not working on other material more often.  I have a hard time saying no to anyone who asks for help.  In the future if given the opportunity I would better manage my time between my studies and helping others with their studies.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Our individual projects this mod were the number guesser, three static comps that put heavy emphasise on html and css and I had 2DoBox by myself also. The problem solving aspects of the projects is my favorite part.  I really enjoy the logical breakdown and solving of problems.  The static comps are great projects to hone your html and css skills.  I feel my html and css skills have increased dramaticly this mod.

#### Number Guesser

* https://github.com/KHunts4130/number-guesser2
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

Build an application where you guess a random number from 1 to 100 and increase/decreases by 10 everytime you get the answeer correct.  This was a fun light project to get the mod started.  I always enjoy some nice math problems.

#### static Comp 1
Recreate a static web page from a design.  The static comp projects are designed to improve your html and css skills and they do.

* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html
The first static comp was a nice project as it helped reaffirm my belief in my html and css skills.  My ability in those areas has grown immensely lately. 

#### static Comp 2
Recreate another web page from a design.  This time it is more intensive with more elements to be placed and styled. Designed to test your design, html and css skills.

#### static Comp 3
The last of the static comp projects to build.  This one is far more complex and complicated then the first two.  This project not only tests your design, html and css skills it also tests your patients as this project takes a lot of time and can be very frustrating at time.  Stick to it is the name of the game here.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The paired projects are a good exercise in working with others.  I enjoy the collaberation on these projects as id you have an open mind you get the chance to see solutions to problems done in ways that you might not have thought of.  I learned more from working with others on projects then working by myself.

#### Linked List

* https://github.com/KHunts4130/KH-JH-linked-list
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

Build a simple app to allow the user to build a list of bookmarked sites with links. Can be marked as read and deleted.

(It was a great paired project! I sincerely appreciated the time you took to explain things to me that I didn't understand with JavaScript and JQuery, and you took as much time as I needed. I also greatly appreciated the work flow and the good communication we had through Slack and our mobile phones and overall communication. And most notably, the positive feedback you gave me was encouraging and made me feel a lot better about my current abilities and understanding of the material. My only coaching feedback would be that we went through some things pretty quickly since you were more familiar with the material (JQuery vs Vanilla JS) than I was, and felt like our working styles of what was a priority clashed a little. I would suggest being just a little more open to different working styles however you adapted really well to my style and were open minded.)


### Idea Box

* https://github.com/KHunts4130/kh-ct-idea-box
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

Build an app for saving and recording ideas. The app is to have real time filtering of stored data. This was a great project to get your hands dirty with local storage and array prototypes.
https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1804/mod-1/idea-box/kent-cody.md

(no feedback was returned to me for this partner)

### ToDoBox Pivot

* https://github.com/KHunts4130/2DoBox-Pivot
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html

Refactor a code base in Jquerry.  Fix features that are not working correctly and add new features to the code base.

I did not have a partner for this project and I was excited to get into the code base by myself.  unfortunately for me I got extremely sick for 8 days and that dramaticly hindered my ability to work on this project.  I was very dissapointed in not being well enough to make any significant head way on this project. 

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL]()

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(I took the experience head on this time. My confidence was higher this time so I helped mentor/tutor my fellow cohort mates in anything they needed/wanted help with.  I ran a few early morning study sessions for the class along with two live coding DOM manipulation examples. I spent my weekends either at Turing studying with fellow classmates or at Skylab doing the same.  I really tried to engage in every social aspect of the program that I had time for. I ran the imposters group this mod to help support others who feel like they are out of place or lost here.  I know how that feels and do not want anyone to feel the way I did my first time through. One thing that is for sure is that you can not succeed at Turing without the community.)
