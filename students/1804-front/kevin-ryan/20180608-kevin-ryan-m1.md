(evaluation scores)

Functional Expectations
 * Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

HTML
 * Accessibility
 * Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

Style
 * Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

CSS
 * Structure of Code
 * Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
 * Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

Implementation
 * Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

JAVASCRIPT
 * Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
 * Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
Conditional Logic
 * Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.
Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

Functions & Scope
 * Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
 * Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

Arrays
 * Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift.  * Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
 * Proficient Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

Objects & Prototypes
 * Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
 * Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

DOM Manipulation
 * Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.
 * Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
Style
 * Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

GIT & GITHUB
Git
 * Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
 * Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

Github
 * Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.
 * Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

DESIGN
Comp Recreation
 * Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

PAIRING
Collaboration
 * Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
 * Exceptional Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.

TERMINOLOGY
Technical Vocab
* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time.  * Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Mental Health 101

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up)

It is no secret that learning something new, something difficult can be a mental strain. But often the physical impact is overlooked. Finding a balance is important. Taking care of your physical needs even when time is limited is integral and should be incorporated into your daily routine. Someone once said, "a healthy happy body is key to a happy healthy mind." I have found that the more routine my day is the more I am able to focus, even when something unexpected arrises. Short workouts and engagement in the moment has helped me to maintain a relativley focused perspective.

### Gear Up
#### Code Debugging The Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up)

Diversity continues to be an issue in programming. As a white male, my demographic makes up a majority of programmers. As a result, I feel we have a responsibility to share our knowledge and help to break down the perceptions that programming is exclusive to a specific group of people. I plan to find ways to share my knowledge through education. I hope to partner with my former employer to start a coding class/ workshop in order to bring awareness to the industry that my former students don't have opportunities to engage in. 

### Gear Up
#### Winning Through Failure --choosing the path of most resistance

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up)

"Learning how to accept failure as being okay is part of growing as a person." This session was led by Mod 4 students and it was interestig to hear their individual stories of success and failure. The session itself was light-hearted as many of the stories were told with good humor often with the story-teller laughing at their own stories. It was a perfect way for me to cap week 5 having already decided to repeat Module 1. It reinforced my desicion and helped me to focus on the reason I made the decision. It's for me, to become a better developer and better version of myself.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I feel I have become not only a participant but also an agent for the change Turing is promoting. Being here has helped me reflect on the person I am and rethink what I am capable of. I have reached out and found ways to connect with others at school. Whether through attending a Demo Night or bringing my significant other to the significant others meet up, I feel I have become part of the community.
