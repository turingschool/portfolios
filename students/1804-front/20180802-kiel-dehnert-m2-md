### Kiel Dehnert - M2/M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

At the beginning of the mod I honestly didn't know what to expect. Quickly it became apparent that the purpose of this mod was to develop the fundamentals needed for the future of Turing and my career as a developer. I learned that the most important thing was to understand conceptually how to manipulate data, and what is going on under the hood. I feel I accomplished that goal to my satisfaction and I'm excited about using the tools I have learned. I was also really excited about learning React, and I'm excited to get into it even more next mod.

## Community Participation

I definitley contribute as much as I can to the Turing community. The main way that I have done this for this mod specifically was staying busy on the pairing schedule. I quickly became busy and my schedule remained full. It was a pleasure to help mod-1 out and I feel like I was an invaluable resource to all of their learning process. I am also doing a top talk at the beginning of next inning, so that should help out all of the lower mods then as well.
