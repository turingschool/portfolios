# Kurt Miller - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My areas of emphasis this module were to continue to uphold the study habits I made in Mod 1, like pre-reading and doing additional research on lesson topics other than what was covered in class. I also looked forward to starting to learning React and solving problems using Array Prototypes.

In this project, I built a simple autocomplete system in JavaScript utilizing my boilerplate repo to set up the initial project configuration. We tested this application using Mocha and Chai.

My Group Projects this mod included Game Time & Weathrly.

#### Game Time

In this project, we constructed a fully functional snake game using Object-Oriented Programming (i.e. Classes). This project helped solidify my knowledge of Class inheritance and ES6 syntax.

#### Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kmiller9393/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

In this project, we created a weather application that accurately displays the current weather, seven hour weather and ten day weather based on the location a user inputs into the application. We built this application with React JS and utilized an API from Weather Underground. This application also includes an autocomplete feature that makes it easy for the user to search for a location.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This module, whenever a Mod 1 student reached out to me for help, I did my best to meet with them regardless of what I was working on. I did my best to set aside as much time as needed for each student that reached out to me in order to make sure they were in a better spot than before they met up with me to review their code.
