# Gray Smith - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For my first module I set out to solidify all of my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS fundementals. Although I had some experience coming into this course with online self-study, I am a firm believer that practice makes perfect and the more repetition and practice I had, the better my muscle memory for building apps would become. Most of my self study has been following along with a tutorial and I knew that at Turing, I would get a ton of practice in working through problems on my own. My goal throughout this first module was to be able to be presented with a problem and then be able to conceptualize how to solve that problem, break it down into small steps, and then execute a solution in JavaScript.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Number Guesser

For this project, I had the user set a min and max and then have to guess a random number in between those values. When the user guessed the correct number, they were presented with a math problem using the values of their first guess, the actual number and the amount of guesses it took the user to guess the number. Only after solving the math problem could the user advance to the next round. This was a great introduction to basic JavaScript logic, data validation, and and DOM manipulation.

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### Linked List

For this project we made a bookmark management application where the user could add a bookmark including its title and url. The user can then remove or mark the bookmark as read. The user can also clear all bookmarks that have been marked as read. This project taught me a lot about working with dynamically created elements in JavaScript using event delegation and propigation.

#### IdeaBox

For this project made an application for storing all of our great ideas and rating them, so we can remember our ideas later and how great they were. This project taught me a lot about how to organize a basic data structure and use local storage to persist data on page refresh.

#### 2DoBox

For this project we took an existing code base and refactored the code to make it fully optimized. We made it into a fully functioning IdeaBox and then pivoted the app into 2DoBox, which lets the user save a task with an importance level for later completion. This app taught me a lot about how to adapt to an existing code base and refactor without changing the main principles of the existing code.

## D: Professional Skills

In my professional development at Turing, I used the strengths finder test to establish what my strengths in the workplace are and how I can best use them to my advantage. Knowing these strengths will help me be aware of my identity as a developer. We also had many discussions about how to best cater to and work with people that have different strengths from our own. I created a Linked In profile at the beginning of the mod and have made almost 400 connections so far. Finally I continued to develop my profile on Github with over 450 contributions so far this year, as well as my stack overflow, twitter, and codewars.

### Gear Up

#### Mental Health 101

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

The mental health gear up was very interesting to me because we talked a lot about stress, the signs of stress, and how different people handle stress. This connected with me because I've always been a little bit of an anxious person and I've had to deal with a lot of stress especially within the last few years. I am also a firm believer that mental stress can 100% have physical effects. I've seen it happen. Being able to have concrete markers to know when my stress levels are getting out of the normal range and what to do to maintain a low level of stress is an important life skill for anyone.

#### Code 2.0: Debugging the Gender Gap

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

Having only one girl in our Turing cohort really made me realize that there is still a significant lack of diversity in the tech community we need to be actively promoting diversity. I thought it was interesting that the video went into some of the root causes of why this might be the case. Clearly, Turing and I would hope the entire tech community these days is completely accepting of women and all racial and ethnic groups. So why are there still these gaps? Part of the problem probably roots in why these diverse groups aren't getting interested in technical topics in the first place. If we can solve that problem, we may be one step close to closing the gap.

#### Public Data & Civic Tech

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1804inning/public_data.md)

Especially as a student in the front end program at Turing, I've been interesting in using APIs and manipulating data that is already available. I've also been very interested in civic tech and how I can use my skills as a developer to help the community. One way I've done that in the past is by working on an app called EncoreLink with Code for Denver, where establishments like retirement homes can connect with musicians willing to volunteer. I always hear about how messy and bad government data is, but one thing I learned in this gear up is that at https://data.colorado.gov/ there is actually a lot of good clean JSON API government data, that could be good to use in some future apps.

## E: Community Participation

I think I've done a good job in contributing to the overall benefit of the Turing community. I've spent lots of time helping my classmates when they've been stuck on projects. I've helped students in other mods with understanding React, ES6, Node, and Ruby on Rails. I've shared my original JavaScript and CSS markdown cheat-sheets with many members of the community. I've recommended tutorials and podcasts that helped me learn many different web technologies. I've also been a positive representation of Turing School at meetups like 'Code for Denver' and 'ReactJS Denver'.

### Playing a Part

I've done my best to connect with as many people as I can at Turing and to lift those around me. I am a firm believer in the collective success of all Turing students and how we each perform in the outside world reflects back on all of us. That said, I have been very open with any knowledge that I came in with and will really do anything to help my fellow classmates. I try to participate in the community as much as my free time will allow me to. I've attended the last 3 or 4 demo nights to support my classmates and see what they have been working on. I've also been able to represent Turing by attending several meetups throughout my first module.
