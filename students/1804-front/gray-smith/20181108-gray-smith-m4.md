### What was your biggest achievement of the module?

I think my biggest achievement of the module was working alongside my cohort-mate Tim and two students in the back-end program to build an MVP of our TalentBuyer app. This was an idea that I had been sitting on for a while and it was awesome to see it finally come to fruition. Since we were working on my idea, I took a leadership role on this project and was able to get everyone motivated and excited about the project. We worked very closely with the back-end students to come up with how the data would be structured and what endpoints we would need in order to build a clean front-end. It will continue to be an iterative process, but I am proud of what we have accomplished so far.

### What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

I think my biggest recent technical struggle was web-scraping talent agency pages for artists and then subsequently making API calls with those names to gather additional information and putting them into a database. The initial struggle was scraping an infinite scroll page. I spent time reading the Nightmare docs and reading some code examples until I was able to figure out how to continuously scroll and wait before collecting data.

The second problem that arose was delaying the process of iterating through the names as to not hit the rate limit on our API calls. Due to time constraints, this is a problem that we are still working through, but after being referred an npm package called 'Delay' by our teacher Robbie, I am confident we will be able to successfully be able to solve this problem.

I think I've learned that determining a specific goal on what you want to do is really the hardest problem. Once you know exactly what you want to accomplish and have some idea of how it should be done, it is only a matter of time and research until that problem can be solved.

### What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

I think one thing that sets me apart from my peers is how much independent learning I try to do outside of Turing. On my bike rides to and from school every single day, I have listened to 'Software Engineering Daily' and picked up a lot of knowledge about scaling and devops. I also watch tons of tutorials and conference talks in my limited spare time. As much as I learned from Turing and enjoyed the process, I know that it is only part of my total self curriculum.

I also truly subscribed to the idea of collective success throughout the entire program and have stayed late and done everything I could to lend my peers a hand if I was able to. I believe that helping others greatly increased my learning throughout the program. I have to thank my peers for this because this would have been much harder if I hadn't taken such a liking to everyone in my cohort.

### How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

I had prior experience in building out full stack applications through tutorials before Turing so I think I had more of a full picture than some going into the back-end lessons. However, practice makes perfect and I think I got a lot more confident in being able to take any idea and be able to turn it into an MVP.

I wouldn't say what I had previously learned had been completely reframed, but as I learn how to do new things, it makes me want to jump back into old projects, improve the quality of the code and add new features.

### What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

I think the most important skill that I will take into my job is my hard work ethic and being able to work well with pretty much anyone. I think I have the ability to motivate others and instill confidence in people. I have been trying to do this my whole life, but I think this skill was really refined at Turing.

I also think I have a keen eye for when things may be working, but they can be cleaned up and made to be more efficient and more readable so that when the next developer has to look at the code they will hopefully be able to quickly know how the code works.
