# Gray Smith - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I knew this module was about fundementals so I really set out solidify my JavaScript fundementals in understanding all aspects of the language as well as working with array prototype methods. I also wanted to solidify my understanding of some CS fundementals like sorting algorithms and more complex data structures. Finally I wanted to have a solid understanding of ReactJS and how to use it to build awesome apps!

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects, Sorting Suite and Complete Me, were both challenging and a great dive into some more fundemental computer science topics. I enjoyed them both and I think they gave me a better understanding of how some of JavaScript works under the hood. It is also good to have this knowledge if I want to learn some lower level languages that maybe don't have some of these things built in.

#### Sorting Suite

The first individual project, Sorting Suite, was great practice in implementing sorting algorithms in JavaScript. It was nice to code these algorithms out and know exactly what's going on under the hood since sorting is so important to computer science. I also enjoyed being able to compare these sorting algorithms to each other as far as their performance and ease of implementation.

#### Complete Me

The second individual project, Complete Me, was an implementation of a prefix trie and basic methods including insert, suggest, and populate. The populate method was used to insert an array of words into the trie, while the suggest method was used to give a user a list of suggestions from words in the trie depending on what they had typed in. This project was an interesting look into the different ways we can store data and it was nice to create my own npm module and then later use it in another project.

## C: Group Work & Projects

I really enjoyed working on both paired projects this mod. Game Time was a great look into game development, something I wasn't super excited for at first, but I ended up really liking. Weatherly was a great first dive into react and I really felt like I learned a lot and solidified things that I was kind of shaky on before.

#### Game Time

For this project, my partner Benjamin Paige and I recreated the classic Tron arcade game using Object Oriented Programming and vanilla JavaScript. I wasn't super excited for this project at first, but once we got into it, it was really fun to learn the basics of game development and to make something that people could have fun with.

#### Weatherly

Weatherly was our first React project. It was fun to make a single page application that pulled realtime data from an API. We mocked out the design for the app in Figma before doing any styling which was a really good workflow that I will definitely use in the future. I also enjoyed using Jest and Enzyme for testing this application so when we made a change, we knew if anything in our application had broken.

## D: Community Participation

I've done my best to connect with as many people as I can at Turing and to lift those around me. I am a firm believer in the collective success of all Turing students and how we each perform in the outside world reflects back on all of us. I have been very open with any knowledge that I came in with and will really do anything to help my fellow classmates.

### Playing a Part

I have tried to be a driving force in the learning of everyone around me at Turing. I have spent countless hours pairing with peaple in Mod1, helping them with their projects and instilling good fundementals and problem solving skills. I have participated in the community as much as my free time will allow me to. I've attended the last 5 or 6 demo nights to support my classmates and see what they have been working on. I also try to attend as many meetups as possible and always speak very highly of Turing.
