# (Nick Dambrosio) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For my first module here at Turing, I want to focus heavily on solidifying my foundational knowledge of HTML,CSS, and JS. I've done quite a bit of prework, but the lack of structure and community in my learning was very apparent and caused a lot of setbacks. Now that I've taken the jump towards changing that, I need to make sure my projects reflect these new benefits.

The community aspect of Turing is what interests me most. I want to eagerly reach out when I need it and embrace not knowing things.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I learned about CSS grid 5-6 months ago and it looked super fun, but quite daunting. One of my goals for starting Turing was taking a deep dive into grid and learning how to utilize it in a variety of projects. While it may seem like a fairly obvious choice, I used it on all three Static Comps and it made accomplishing clean and elegant layouts incredibly easy. I'm going to refactor my prework site using it, and ensure I use it in projects going forward.


#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imsteaky/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

To build a number guessing game that takes user input and returns a message based on that input

#Review
This game revolved around the concepts of randomly generating a number using Math.random() and comparing user input against that randomly generated number to determine if they won or not. It was a neat introduction to JS logic, validation, and DOM manipulation. My biggest takeaway form this project was the .toggleClass method, which I used to enable multiplayer, and bounce between the players turn after each guess. I utilized the .toggleClass method on every project following this one as a neat trick up my sleeve.

#Instructor comments
Functionality through phase 4, Love the multiplayer
HTMLS Avoid using BR small formatting
CSS Remove padding from body
JS organize variable declarations at top by type

#### (Static Comp 1)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imsteaky/nd-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

To build a static site based off a pre-existing design as a way to test out HTML / CSS.

#Review
I've become a huge fan of the "metro" theme that Windows OS has been pushing over the last few years. The clean, rearrangeable grids are super fun and make it very easy to customize. When I saw this static comp, it was the first thing I thought of and I leapt at the chance to learn css grid from Wes Bos' tutorial series. 

I really enjoyed learning about making div's daisy chain off of a hover event from another div, causing a style change on a DIFFERENT div. The CSS file may be ugly, and it would have been infinitely easier / more readable with JavaScript, but I got to experiment and learn something new and neat using just CSS. I also should have optimized my images instead of expecting 300mb gifs to work properly. I'll be refactoring this over break to ensure it's performance is fixed.

#### (Static Comp 2)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imsteaky/nd-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

To build a static site based off a pre-existing design as a way to test out HTML / CSS.

#Review
Dogs! I didn't have nearly as hard of a time with Static Comp 2 as I did with Static Comp 1 because I planned out the project beforehand. I knew I was going to use grid on the cards-section, and I knew I was going to do the project on Max Fund (the same shelter I got my dog at). This was the first time I experimented with hiding certain elements at certain media-query breakpoints and replacing them with nav-style buttons, to imply that all the elements that are now hidden can be found by clicking through said buttons.

#### (Static Comp 3)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imsteaky/nd-static-comp-challenge3-Refactor)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

To build a static site based off a pre-existing design as a way to test out HTML / CSS.

#Review
I glanced at Static Comp 3 project requirements at the end of my first week at Turing and got very scared. There were a lot of elements on the page and all were placed very intentionally, I didn't have any idea how I would handle the SVGs, and it looked like a it was going to take a lot of work. Unfortunately, I didn't look at the SC3 until the last week of class, a few days before it was due. 

What a mistake(y)! While I somehow managed to pull it off at all browser sizes, my (lack of) time management on this project is by far what hurt me the most. Putting off this project til the last minute gave me way more stress than it was worth, and caused all other areas of the Pentathalon to drag throughout that last week. My first pass through SC3 I barely used CSS grid, and that too, was a giant mistake. Putting each section into it's own grid, and then putting the items inside that section into a grid, made the whole project very easy to approach and should have been my focus from the beginning.


## C: Group Work & Projects

#### (Linked List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imsteaky/LinkedList)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Our first paired project saw us taking user inputs and appending them to a part of the page and was the first time most everyone worked with template literals. Fun stuff, but having a strong partner made it a much more enjoyable experience. We had some pretty novice mistakes with out handling of Github, but nothing that actually caused any problems. 

#Comments

HTML
Use aria labels on inputs!
CSS
Pull duplicate declarations into their own class. ie. border-bottom
Consider using more organizational comments
Lots of inconsistencies - look at the style guides!
JS
Lots of inconsistencies with indentation and semicolons - look at the style guides!
Could be a bit more descriptive with naming conventions

#Partner Feedback
Nick was a very organized partner who took time to structure our workflow into actionable itemized lists. Using Trello as a resource, we were able to track our progress through the various phases and this prevented us from misusing our work time.  Nick also was excellent at completing his designated tasks on time and then helping me solve the problems i had. Nick excels at solving complex coding problems by being unafraid to try different ideas until something works. The only downside to this strategy is sometimes the working code is complex and difficult for others coming into the codebase to understand quickly. To remedy this going forward, Nick could go back and refactor his code to make it easier for others to understand. - Michael Lyons

#### (IdeaBox)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imsteaky/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Thomas was a really powerful partner in this project. We spent hours on and off campus working together on different parts of the project and making sure the other understood it fully. It's a shame that he's moved on to other things.

For the project itself we had to get an ideaBox with local storage going on and we didn't crack that egg until the second to last day. 

#Comments

Able to make blank cards on page load
Quality does not persist
No search or content editable
Looks great!!!
Look into handling overflow from the cards differently so that cards maintain consistency in height

#Partner Feedback
Excellent job styling the page and making it mobile responsive. Also, seeking out the Mod-2 peeps to help with pairing definitely helped us progress through the project quicker! I'd say prioritizing time management more would be beneficial for future partners but we were both guilty of spending too much time on Static Comp 1 so this point is kind of null. - Thomas Scully

#### (2DoBoxPivot)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imsteaky/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

2DoBox Pivot saw us taking a pre-existing project, written by someone else entirely, and refactoring / improving it to meet new standards. It was a in interesting experience taking someone elses code and understanding how it works and how you could refactor it.

#Comments

Functional Partial phase 3, through importance
UI Make input text different color from placeholder text remove quotes around body Show completed items,should have completed class
ARIA all interactive elements should have an aria-label
HTML Be careful with elements with only one child use cdn version of jquery
GIT Make sure to use imperative present voice, be more descriptive with description
JS Make sure you are using parameters in your functions, e.g. IdeaCard id parameter

#Partner Feedback
Nick was incredibly cooperative throughout the entirety of the project.  Any personal deadlines we had set, was met with diligence and promptness from Nick.  In addition, He was adamant about distributing the workload as evenly as possible to not only be fair, but to ensure the best possible outcome.  Most importantly, Nick was very responsive and constructive to any feedback, questions, or comments i had during our project. Nick has a healthy list of strengths when it comes to programming.  One of those strengths is CSS.   Knowing that Nick is exceptionally proficient in CSS, I felt that his focus on Static Comp 2 took away from some of his focus on 2DoBox, so I would suggest he communicate with his next partner more about how to prioritize work together. - Paul Kim

## D: Professional Skills
Telling a proper story is essential and working on a way to spin mine into a positive light has something I've always struggled with. Not only do I generally feel that my story isn't worth hearing at times, but also that it's much better told from a point of struggle and my failures along the way (as there are maaaanny). Putting everything in a positive light is something I'll have to continue working towards throughout my time here.

### Gear Up
#### (Mental Health 101)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

Tackling mental health can be tricky. I for one have experienced struggles with it throughout my adult life, and know that it's something shouldn't be taken lightly. Hopefully by building a strong community here at Turing knowing that this is an opportunity to learn and grow will help improve my success here, and prevent any problems stemming from lack of confidence or stress from things that... generally don't deserve me mentally wasting brainspace to.

#### (Code Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

My previous career saw me in a very male-focused position,in a combat unit in the Army. We didn't have any women assigned to my part of the unit until 2010 or so, and that was a very drastic and sudden change. It was a really interesting experience and shattered a lot of norms / beliefs that women should be sticking to certain roles in their careers. It's a shame this is still a thing in tech eight years later (It's a shame it's a thing anywhere, but still.) As a white heteronormative male, it's my responsibility to ensure the inclusivity of everything I do to try and remove these pre-exiting beliefs about gender/race roles.

#### (You Probably Won't Come To This Session, You'd Rather Be Working On Your Project)

* [GitHub URL](missing)

Hooboy. Once the Pentathalon started I was finally hit with the stress-bus over managing my time / energy and making sure things got completed on time / if I'd be able to move on the mod2 / if I'd be successful at all here. Most (all) of this was me unnecessarily getting inside my head and it was apparent how ineffective it was at motivating me to get things done on time. I'm really glad I got to go to this session, because it gave me the chance to open up to other people in a similar space as me and let me talk about the things that have been bothering me, effectively removing them. I would highly suggest going to this gear up again.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

My biggest goal with coming to Turing (outside of coding) has definitely been embracing the community here, and I think I've done that incredibly well. I've spend the last 3-4 years at my previous job feeling isolated or silo'd, and living in a fairly isolated area, so getting to work well with others was my biggest focus. I think I've done this incredibly well so far, and I thoroughly enjoy working with classmates from different mods / programs and trying to understand their approach.
