## Areas of Emphasis

Hello again.

This mod was a fun one. A week into intermission a mod1 student messaged me on slack asking about what I knew about grid, and if I could help them leverage it for Turing / Personal projects. A short time later I'm known as a css obsessionist and I've got pairings 7 hours a week.
But I really enjoyed it.
Like with mod1 (and what I said in my m1 review md), my biggest emphasis here at Turing has remained involving myself with the community. Teaching a tool I had just learned / got somewhat good at seemed to propel me in that area. I'm not sure how many pairings / total hours I spent here helping 'my juniors' with something I was somewhat good at, but it felt good and I went home at the end of the day feeling accomplished and recharged.

I really wanted to have a better grasp on array prototypes by the end of the mod, but the 'big picture' for me didn't sink in as soon as I hoped it would. I came through on all of our projects despite the challenges they presented, but at the end of the day, I should have a better understanding of some of the material than I do.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Did not pass. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I spent the first half of intermission doing the deepest of dives into CSS. I built a few static-sites from the ground up, and really cemented an understading of grid, positioning, and design. I've made continual, gradual progression and feel like I'm on a really good track to be able to make some incredible looking things, very, very soon.

# Description
(This site takes forever to load the first time. It's a soon to be addressed problem, even listed in issues!)
For prework in mod1, we had to create a site that followed some very basic guidelines. Needs to have a form, needs to have an unordered list, an image, etc. Most of my web experience before Turing was done with framework like bootstrap, so I used what I knew best. Upon evaluation of our day1 sites however, I learned that was a huge mistake(sorry Pam). I never actually revisited the site without using bootstrap, but it was also wasn't brought up again.  

Over intermission break I wanted to remake it and combine a number of the css tricks I learned from the week prior. I made some weird design decisions initially, but also made it a goal to move onto something else after I struggled with any part for 20-25 minutes, so I never really addressed them. (Like that giant text on the hero-page and dividers. Disgusting.) It has a rather big readme with all of the issues I hope to address soon, but most of them are design choices.

#### (1804 Gametime Browser)

* [https://github.com/30ozSteak/1804Game-browser](https://30ozsteak.github.io/1804Game-browser//)

# Description
The first project in mod2 is Gametime, a seemingly harmless paddle through HTML Canvas. A lot of our class struggled for a long time until we got something to work in the slightest, often passing the information about what they just learned to the other group. When the code fair came along there were a number of other students that didn't get to / didn't want to submit their games to it.... but that didn't really jive with me. Everyone should have a change to show off what they made, and I was going to help them do that.

I convinced a number of students to get their game pushed to github pages (which is an immense struggle on it's own) and built a game-browser static site that housed all of them. It's only one page, and is missing a bit of functionality, but it looks dang good and I only spent .... 7 or 8 hours on it.

#### (CompleteMe)

* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html]()

# Description
Our first solo project in Mod2 was to create an auto-complete feature. Auto-complete is a popular feature that uses a prefix trie to structure our data in a way that can be accessed very fast. We incorporated the english dictionary into our trie's in an attempt to guess what the user was typing as they typed it.

# Evaluation Comments (B. Storoz)
Thorough thought process and articulation; needed some extra guidance around the coding but overall kept a logical step-by-step process

# Student Comments
This project was a doozy. There were a good number of hours that passed where I either didn't know where to start, or what I'd even do when I got there. Thankfully, 1804 is filled with incredible devs that really go out of their way to make sure everyone understands the problem and how to get to the solution. Turing was closed on the weekend before the project was due, so a number of us crammed into Denver Bike Cafe and went hard in the paint for close to 10 hours. It wasn't fun, the project didn't really provide any visual feedback that I crave, and I couldn't tell if my tests were legitimate or not for the longest time. The 11th hour of the Sunday before evals I finally learned how to talk about the trie, and somehow to (somewhat) create a new feature for it the next day.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Mod2 projects were fun! I haven't determined if it's luck or not yet, but I've been incredibly happy with all of my partners in 1804 so far. A lot of the projects had us struggling for a few hours, but we always managed to finish a day or so early- leaving time to play around with design or UI.

All of the mod2 group projects were approached with an agile methodology, and were all well documented on the team trello boards. This allowed better collaboration, code understanding, and issue tracking.

#### (Gametime - Snake)

* [Learn about Object Oriented Programming while you build a game in HTML Canvas]()

# Description
Coming into mod2 I was most excited for Gametime. Tory Dannenberg had shown off a really fun adaptation of snake during his Mod2 Gametime project, and it started giving me ideas for what I wanted to accomplish with mine. I was also paired with Chris Boylen, who was repeating mod2, so a lot of the initial hurdles that I likely would have faced with canvas we cleared with moderate ease, as he already knew what to look out for. Chris was an incredible partner, and the late night sessions we had with him, Jesse, Megan, and myself were super helpful.

Back on topic: Tory's gametime game had a fun spin on it's name with 'Severnus Snake'. I took this and ran with it and all of a sudden we were giving the game an "Escape From New York" aesthetic, and the game starred Snake Plissken, an ex-special forces soldier stuck on Manhattan Island Prison.

Fun project. Fun choices were made. Can't wait to approach it again.

# Evaluation Comments (P. Lovett)
- Love the UI AND those angled divs. 
- Appreciate that the game is the centerpeice of the the app and that additional info can be found further down.

# Description
Weatherly was my first glance at anything React, and boy oh boy was it scary. I understood the overall concept of components, and I understood state/setting state, but writing it was a mountain of work. I spent many hours at my Kiel Denhert's house, and his roommate helped steer us in the right direction whenever we were getting lost. It felt like magic when everything appeared on the page properly, and I was honeslty suprised any of it worked for a very long time. I made some fair design choices when it came to the UI, but I was mostly focused on the mobile view. The day before the project was due I had a grand epiphany about how to make css grid and react work, but it was far too late in the game to make some drastic partners. We'll see if I get to implement those ideas in 1806.

# Evaluation Comments (B. Storoz)
- UI was incredibly well received
- All required functionality was presented in an elegant, easy to understand manner.


# Evaluation Scores
- none.. yet?

## D: Community Participation

Like with the last mod, being involved with the community and helping propel others has been one of my main focuses since coming to Turing. I feel like I've done a great job at accomplishing this so far, and can't wait to do it again.

# 1806 Mentorship
A few days into intermission break I received a slack message from an 1806 cohort asking about CSS grid. I was super excited, as it was a tool that I felt I had a good understanding of, and shared as much as I could over the following few days. I guided them through their prework site and helped them understand the fundamentals of html and css before they stepped foot on campus. This really catapulted me into a role of mentorship, and caused me to be open to as many questions and pairings with 1806 as possible. I think by the end of the mod I was pushing 30~ ish hours of pairings with m1 students, and many more after hours of slack chats covering projects, lessons, self esteem, and more.

# Lightning Talk - Top Talks Extravaganza
One of my favorite tools since coming to Turing is CSS grid. It makes positioning elements on your page incredibly easy and has a very small learning curve. After gaining a reputation as 1804's 'Very Good Grid Boy', I chose to make that as my main topic for the required lightning talks that we give to the mod that's our junior. By showing my thought process through a series of animations and guides, I showed 1806 some incredibly easy ways you can tackle seemingly difficult designs, and it was very well received. So much so that they decided I was worthy of talking infront of Turing in the first week of the next inning. Not sure if that's the outcome I was looking for, but I know the changes I need to make and have a good idea of how to make this a fun experience for everyone.

# Code Fair / 1804 Game Browser
There were a limited number of slots for availability when it came to the code fair, but definitely not enough for all of 1804 to submit the hard-work that was their gametime projects. As an attempt to keep up-to-date with my HTML/CSS, I created a simple site that allows the user to browse all of the games that 1804 produced, and play them all in browser. I shared it at the codefair to help promote the community and all the hard work that the fellow devs in 1804 put out in this project.

# World Traveler / Back-end Project Demo-night
I'm working alongside devs in mod3 / 4 backend and helping guide design choices for their capstone project, World Traveler. I'll be listed as a collaborator once intermission comes around and we can really start having some fun.

# Blog
I've started a blog, but was waiting until the end (and restart) of mod2 to publish it. It'll have a major part in my journey through repeating mod2. This blog will eventually be listed on the portfolio site now that I've finally decided on a design, and will be available soon.
