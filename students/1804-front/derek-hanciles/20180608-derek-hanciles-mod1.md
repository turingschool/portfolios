# Derek Hanciles - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
My goal for this module was to develop a foundation and understadning of css, html, and javascript. 
Having this foundation would not only set myself up for success at Turing, but also put me on a trajectory to become a 
successful web-developer. To reach this goal, my focus was to reach out the all resources available. Meetings with my mentor and pairings with collegues from module 2 were approached with clear outlined-objectives. By having clear objectives and expectations for these pairings, I was able to reassure and clarify what I learned, but also align with individuals were recently in my shoes, and use their testimony to help fine tune my outlook and approach to my learning experience. To reach this goal I knew that I would have to work harder than I ever had at anything else in my life. Which meant micromanaging every aspect that would help me reach success and pushing myself put in over 60 hours of work per week.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)
Throughout this module when meet with instances of adversity, and challenges I have never meet before. I knew that I would have to develop a mentality that would conquire myself doubt. Working on my subconscious insecurities would be the only way I could push my self to complete all projects and evals presented. After tough mid-mock assesments, I had now idea how I was going to continue pushing through, after my fears had been met and I fell flat on my face.  As this doubt grew I still had other projects to work on. As I approached these other projects I began to reflect, and understand this is a marathon and not a sprint. The only way I could be confident in my work was to truely measure my growth. Reviewing each days lesson and then applying what I learned. By doing this I began to open up and talk to others about what I learned, and ask more clarifying questions. As the weeks progressed my outlook on my learning experience changed from, "Do I know this?", to the realization that week to week my acumen has not only grown, and that I am can only have confidence in my learning if I reflect on and apply what I learned. Following my end of module assesment I have continued to grow, and showed the growth to demonstrate that I have the knowledge to pass and move on to the next module. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/Dhanciles/dh-number-guesser-portfolio
* [Original Assignment] http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

In this project we built a game where users can guess between numbers 1 and 100. We crated an input field for the user to guess the number, and the specific button for clearing the input field, a button to submit the guess, and a button that resets the game. To make the page interactive with the user a section should display their most recent guess, and give feed back on their guess.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)
My approach to group projects was establish a mentality of professionalism, because once I am done at Turing and in a job setting I will commonly find myself in these situations and I feel it would be great to establish great pairing habits now. Each parired project or group activity was a learning experience from me. My focuses each time were to make sure me and my partners were on the same page by aligning with them, acknowledging any concerns, and assure that were on task.

#### Linked-List

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/dmiller1623/linked-list-
* [Original Assignment] http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

Using two input fields, we had to prepend the information from the input fields once the submit button was triggerd into a new section. Once the new section was created it should have features such as, a button to remove the section, a button to mark the seaction as "read", and the input that transfers the url text to the new section should be clickable. 

(evaluation comments)
Functional Parts of phase 1, 2, 3 Read first bookmark only, cant unread Delete first bookmark only check to see if https is in url string

UI remove white spacing body { margin: 0 }
HTML fix indentation use ul for list remove uneccessary label elements
CSS fix formatting
JS Avoid mixing JS & jQuery for DOM interaction
GIT Work on branching cycle

(feedback to me - from Dennis)
We worked really well together. I appreciated the amount of time you put into the work. We were not able to apply our media queries so we needed to work on being able to implement our media query to finish our project. We needed to have a better understanding of how media queries work.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/james-burbage/idea-box
* [Original Assignment] http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

This project involved looking at the server and client as seperate entities. Using two input fields and the event of our submit button we are transferring information from the from the inputs into a new section. This new section added functionality where users could press an up or down button to toggle through desired quality. In this new project the user should now have the ability to edit the information transferred to the input fields, as they are now currently displayed in a new section. A third input is involved that is now a serach input which allows the user to filter through ideas in real time.  

(evaluation comments)
Solid comp implementation.
Good use of aria-labels - really only needed on inputs though
Consider adding organizational comments
Consider pulling duplicate declarations into a more broad class rule
Make sure you're using google fonts correctly
Pseudo code more and possibly use a checklist
Separate the data model from the markup - ie. Idea instead of IdeaCard

#### To Do Box Refactor
* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/K-Rye/2DoBox-Pivoit
* [Original Assignment] http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html

In this paired project we were assigned a project from an individual who was in a previous module. The goal was to refactor their code, making it more efficient, and also fixing bugs through refactoring their code. In addition to refactoring we were also required add aditional features to the code as well. 

(evaluation comments)
Cards do not persist
Quality is not working
Can create cards without information
Make sure that application is accessible
Organize your CSS with comments and SMACSS

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Health and Wellness

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md

This session helped me identify areas of my well being that I would need to focus on to be successfull at Turing. I really honed in on things that stress me out and how to recognize the stress. Ensuring that I am open with my concerns and addressing my stress is the best way to avoid having a break down in this pressure cooker. Also being cognisent of the things I can do to make sure I'm having fun and doing things outside of Turing that make me, me. 

### Gear Up
#### Code Debugging and the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md
Being a minority who pursuing a career in a primarily white male dominated industry is definitely a challenge. I was quilcky able to empathize with the women in this video, and how society attempts to typecast them into different roles that would never fit the tech industry. It was great to relay my thoughts to the individuals in group and it allowed them to empathize with me, and also have a new outlook in which they can contribute change and be at the forefront for inclusivity of all races, genders, and sexual-oreintations in the tech industry. 



### Gear Up
#### Self Doubt

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1804inning/self_doubt.md

Above I mentioned addressing my self doubt would be key for me to be successful at Turing. This session allowed me to get input from people who have the same thoughts. It was great to get their insight on dealing with self doubt, but also talk about embracing it and truly lying to yourself as a condition to build confidence. This session really resonated with me and I was glad to be apart of it. 


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
I was respectable and empathetic to others throughout this my first module at Turing. By being inclusive to others, reaching out to learn others stories as well as mine, helped strengthen this already blossoming community.
