# Chris Boylen - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal this module was to improve my understanding and implementation of the array prototype methods, improve my solving problem process, solidify my foundation of react and improve my communication skills.  I focused on improving my vocabulary when talking through code.  I've improved my problem solving process by first defining the problem, defining what type of answer we want back, breaking larger problems into smaller identifiable problems, and talking my way through my process.  I feel as though I have improved in all of these areas.  

## Self-Evaluation

* **A: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **B: Group Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **C: Professional Skills**: 3.5
* **D: Community Participation**: 3.5
* **E: Final Assessment**: 4

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

I feel that the individual projects this module helped me improve my problem solving process.  Due to the fact that the projects were more difficult and contained more pieces, I had to break these problems down into smaller identifiable problems, so they were easier to test and complete. I plan to continue this moving forward.

Moving forward I plan to work on problems that I don't know and might show up on an interview.  I want to improve my problem solving process while learning to break through tough points easier.

### Study Habits

My study habits changed this module by actively seeking help from a variety of resources to enable me to better understand concepts that were harder for me to grasp on my own.  I utilized instructors, classmates, upper mod students, and my mentor to pair and force me to work through problems when I encountered something difficult.  I plan to continue this moving forward.


### Complete Me
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chrisboylen/complete-me-2.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 3
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 3
* **Functional Expectations:** 4
* **Code Sanitation:** 3

I enjoyed working on Complete Me by myself. It helped me to improve my problem solving process.  This project helped me improve upon taking a solution that i can envision and turn it into code.  By breaking problems down into smaller identifiable problems, I was able to focus more specifically on one thing. I was also able to talk through the code during my evaluation.  This will help me moving forward when I encounter large complex problems.

## B: Group Work & Projects

My group work throughout the module strengthened my collaboration, communication, leadership and problem solving skills.  I enjoyed all the partners that I had throughout the module and think that my group projects went well.  I plan to continue to strengthen my collaboration, communication, leadership and problem solving skills moving forward.

### GameTime
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/30ozSteak/CB-ND-Gametime-Snake.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)
* **Partner:** Nick Dambrosio
* **Game:** Snake
* **Functional Expectations:** 3.5
* **User Interface:** 4
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 3
* **JS Style:** 3
* **Workflow:** 3

With GameTime, I enjoyed working with Nick.  We set up a game plan up front and one of the aspects that we wanted to focus on was creating a retro style game based on the movie escape from new york.  We focused heavily on designing the user interface so that it worked well with our theme.  I also enjoyed learning canvas.  Working with Nick strengthened my collaboration, communication, leadership and problem solving skills.  I was able to take on a leadership role in the direction of the project. 

### Weathrly
* [Github Url](https://github.com/chrisboylen/React-Weather-App.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)
* **Partner:** Todd Ayres
* **Spec Adherence:** 4
* **User Interface:** 3
* **HTML Style:** 3
* **CSS/Sass Style:** 3
* **JS/React Style:** 3.5
* **Testing:** 4
* **Workflow:** 3
* **Code Sanitation:** 3

With Weatherly, I enjoyed learning and testing react.  By taking a leadership role, I felt like I was able to gain a better foundation of React.  I found it rewarding taking the lead with Todd as a partner and thought we worked well together.  Moving forward, I plan to develop my react skills further.

## C: Professional Skills

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * Empathy and privilege, tragedy of the commons, and Relax.

I found that the empathy and privilege Gear up was really valuable.  I encouraged discussion around ways we as a whole can minimize privilege and marginalization, therefore creating a more inclusive community. I feel that this helped our cohort become closer by having these discussions. I also feel that these discussions are important moving forward, especially when working collaboratively with others.

## Community Participation

In the community I tried to bring a positive experience with anyone that I interacted with.  I paired with students from mods above and below me and found it to be valuable.  I also tried to support the students in my current cohort during difficult times.

## Final Assessment

Moving forward I plan to improve my problem solving process, communication and organization skills.  I also want to get better at React, testing and working more efficiently with others. Over intermission I plan to spend more time with React while enjoying time with my family, while still maintaining healthy eating, sleeping, exercising, and studying habits.
