# Tim Fischer - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I focused on refining and expanding my understanding of object oriented programming by diving more into the Javascript language. I also created a base knowledge of the React library.

A trie is a data structure in computer science. The word trie is derived from the word retrieval (as in re-trie-val).

Now there are many types of tries and one you will hear a lot about is the binary search trie. It is similar to a linked list the difference being that each child node has a single left and right node attached to it.

The benefits of something like a trie is that it makes dealing with large sets of data easier to handle.

It’s important to know what Mother Nature is going to throw at you each day – what if you wear flip flops because it’s sunny and 65 degrees in the morning and then it snows all afternoon (this is Colorado, after all).

As web developers you’re going to be living in the context of the web. With this next project you will be interacting with a web-api. Ultimately this is going to be a preview for what the real world is going to look like for most of you. Data is important and thats what the API provides. As a web-developer you will be giving value to that data by visualizing and organizing that data for your user base.

In this project you will be getting your first real interactions with ReactJS, asynchronous javascript, and managing the state of your application.

## D: Community Participation

I dedicated a significant amount of my time to reaching out to mod 1 this inning. I attempted to leave my schedule open to pairings as well as check in at the end of days. Mu intention was to offer as much of my advice as possible to whomever was willing to reach out for it.

### Playing a Part

I continue to reach out to anyone considering a career change. I feel like the best way to spread the potential of Turing is to inspire those who are looking for a new passion driven skill set.
