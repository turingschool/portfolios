# Benjamin Paige - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In Mod 1 I set out to create a strong foundation of knowledge upon which I can build on during my time here at Turing and for the rest of my career as a developer.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

My end of module assessments went well. I was slow but strong with my DOM manipulation and creature code challenge. Surprisingly my static comp challenge went really well, even though I felt like my design skills have always been my weakest link in my projects.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

During mod 1, there were four individual projects including, Number Guesser, Static Comp 1, Static Comp 2, and Static Comp 3.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/benjaminpaige/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser tested our skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript after only one week of classes. The directions were to build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. The phases then added complexity by adding requirements such as only numbers can be inputted, buttons toggle enabled or disabled, and increasing difficulties for the user. I learned so much building this program and am shocked at how much progress I have made since then. 

## Evaluator: Nathaniel Foster
## Notes/What To Work On:

* Functional through phase 4 with some minor bugs min can be greater than max guess counter does not reset guess counter keeps counting even if outside range

* HTML Use a form

* look into form reset

* Validate input value is not NaN

* formatting of JS random number function

## Functional Expectations

* Exceptional: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three and one or more of the extensions.

#### Static Comp Challenge 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/benjaminpaige/benjaminpaige.github.io/tree/master/bp-comp-challenge-1)
* [GitHubPages URL](https://benjaminpaige.github.io/bp-comp-challenge-1/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

Static Comps are intended to keep our HTML and CSS skills strong while our classes focus on JavaScript. We are provided with a static image and are required to recreate it as a responsive site. We are not given liberties with the layout, but colors, images, and styling is allowed.

#### Static Comp Challenge 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/benjaminpaige/benjaminpaige.github.io/tree/master/bp-comp-challenge-2)
* [GitHubPages URL](https://benjaminpaige.github.io/bp-comp-challenge-2/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

Static Comps are intended to keep our HTML and CSS skills strong while our classes focus on JavaScript. We are provided with a static image and are required to recreate it as a responsive site. We are not given liberties with the layout, but colors, images, and styling is allowed.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

In this first mod, we had three group projects. They were Linked List, Idea Box, and 2DoBox Pivot. These projects put to test not only our technical skills, but also our partnering skills. It was just as important to work well with other people who may or may not share your strengths, weakness, or work styles as it was to complete the requirements.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/benjaminpaige/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List was a paired project and my partner was Tom King. The rubric required two layouts, a desktop and mobile. The basis of the project was to have two input fields for Title and Website, and using these inputs create a list of bookmarked sites. As the phases progressed, the functionality became more complicated such as a "read" button, restricting input values, disabling buttons, and usable links after creation.

## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Make sure to do a DTR every project

## Functionality
- Good job with getting through all the phases - but remember to stay within the scope of the project spec

## Comp Recreation/Design
- Goal should be to recreate the comp in a pixel-perfect fashion - app does not do this for majority of screen sizes. 

## Git/GitHub
- Be sure that you are following commit conventions (i.e., first letter capitalized, concise but verbose, etc)
- Would like to see more commits

## HTML
- Add labels for inputs
- Add lang for `HTML` tag
- Send through screenreader
- Good nesting/formatting

## CSS
- Nice job using `box-sizing: border-box`
- Declarations in selectors should be organized alphabetically or [clustered by related properties](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)
- Keep your [CSS selectors short](https://csswizardry.com/2012/05/keep-your-css-selectors-short/)

## JS
- Remove commented out code
- Opportunities for refactoring with duplicated lines and breaking apart functionality
- Work on naming
- Returning boolean in `else` on lines 41-43 not necessary
- Nice job attempting to dig into regex code

## Functional Expectations

* Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.

## Feedback from Partner
I appreciate those critical moments when you kept things on track and stopped me from attacking all the problems at once. You have a knack for providing positive reinforcement at the right moments and that really helped me keep a cool head. The student has become the teacher, you persevered even when things were confusing and unnecessarily difficult. Challenging yourself to accept the added hurdle of persisting through all the data wasn't easy, but without your commitment to it we would have never gotten through. That willingness to push beyond just 'good' is what will make you great.  

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

For this paired project my partner was Alex Bruce. Idea Box was a project very similar to Linked List with two input fields creating a list of ideas. However, one of the focuses was providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. We relied on JavaScript and jQuery to implement filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist the ideas between sessions.

## Evaluator: Nathaniel
## Notes/What To Work On:

Functional
problem searching body 
Add empty items

HTML
use article for cards or other semantic tag
love the aria-labels
use aria-labels for save button

CSS
get rid of stuff that is not necessary
justify-content/align-items only effect elements with display: flex

JS
Add local copy of jquery
use return with map
dry up repetitive code, 


## Functional Expectations
* Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.

## HTML

## Accessibility

* Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.

## Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

## Implementation

* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.


## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

## Conditional Logic

* Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.

## Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

## Arrays

* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

## Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

## DOM Manipulation

* Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.
* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style

* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.


## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.

## Github

* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

## TERMINOLOGY

## Technical Vocab

* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.

#### 2DoBox Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/benjaminpaige/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

2DoBox was a great experiment in taking another groups Idea Box and pivoting it into our own project. Without scraping the code entirely, we were to complete any missing functionality, change it's styling, and building more functionality on top of it. This provided a great experience of not starting from scratch, breaking down and understanding someone elses code, then knowing the code well enough to utilize it in expanded functionality.

## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

## OVERALL
- Good job doing DTR and working remotely
- Through part of Phase III
- No need for rounded inputs/buttons
- Comp recreation looks good overall - some polishing and attention to spacing needed
- Search is a little buggy with upper vs lowercase
- `Completed Task` functionality not complete

## GIT/GITHUB
- More commits
- Work on being descriptive with your commit messages

## HTML
- Make accessible - add labels to your inputs, run through a screen reader, etc

## CSS
- Organize rules and use comments - parts of CSS are hard to follow
- Several places with duplicated code from original codebase
- Avoid IDs as selectors in CSS due to specificity

## JS
- Great job breaking functionality apart and getting rid of global vars, anonymous functions, broken code
- Naming is easy to follow
- Some areas of duplication that could be refactored

## D: Professional Skills
Turing's mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. Our vision is a world powered by technology where the people building it represent the people using it. We're here to build a movement.

In order to advance this mission and vision, the curriculum transcends technical training. We are presented with opportunities to grow as individuals, members of a team, and members of a community.

Gear Up provides a forum for students to develop self-awareness and interpersonal skills. Each module includes 3 Gear Up sessions, one each on personal growth, team dynamics, and social responsibility.

### Gear Up
#### Health and Wellness 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

This Gear Up was about always having a growth mindset. Many turing students are developed adults that have grown into patterns and set ways. However, we have all come here to make a change in our lives and ee need to take that mindset of growing into a new role, and apply that to many aspects of our life. 

This was a really productive class,  I think this was hard for me during a time of high stress because I was putting pressure on myself but I became frustrated when not being able to understand certain concepts. I enjoyed discovering how learning and difficult tasks can drain all of your cognitive resources. I particularly liked these suggestions:

* Split your learning material into smaller sub-skills and learning in pieces
* Revisit skills you've mastered
* Learn with high quality and high quantity examples


#### Health and Wellness 2

*[GitHub URL](https://turingschool.slack.com/files/U794DR5KL/F8R3RGX9B/well-being_self_care_101.pptx)

This Gear up was about stress and how it affects us; about the types of stress, how it affects a person, how to manage it, and what you can do about it. The second power point was about macro and micro self care. It also provided us with remedies to negative stress and provided tips on setting boundries. 

The second health and wellness session was focused on self-care. I learned about how important self-care is for sustainability at work, creativity, and stress resilience. I have continued to think about how self-care starts with self-awareness and that we can create new norms in the tech industry. I have tried to maintain a consistent exercise, feeding schedule, and sleep schedule to maintain a healthy mental state.

#### Mod 4 Leads

For this Gear up we split up into groups to have talks that were lead by mod 4 students. My group presented BioHacking. This session addressed the concept of what the general conception of what Bio Hacking is understood to be. There were several directions the presenters took, including genetic code manipulation. Physical acts of self mutilation in order to incorporate our human biological structures with technology, etc. This was a very interesting topic and the presenters did a great job of keeping everyone engaged and entertained. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

My community involvement revolved around helping students around me. I was always open and willing to help anyone in need. Much of my assistance was focused on the logic aspects of our projects. I also let a group session with students from our mod through Mythical Creatures to help them prepare for the evaluation. I also joined in social events such as the code fair and group gatherings outside of Turing.
