## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)

I feel like I passed the pentathalon week for sure. I didn't make it through all of the phases in the dom and I didn't tottaly finish the mythical creatures challenge, but I felt pretty comfortable with solving the material and I feel that the feedback from my instructors reflected that.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

These are my projects that I worked on individually.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brandonfiebiger/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

The application generates a random number between one and one-hundred. The user guesses the number if they guess too low the number guess will tell the user to guess higher and if the guess is too high it will tell the user to guess lower. If the user guesses correctly the application prints 'BOOM'.

(feedback to me)

Brandon is a really good guy.  I sincerely appreciate his focus and dedication.  I believe he'll do well as a developer and anything else he chooses to work on. We had some scheduling challenges that I take responsibility for.  As our first project this was also elevated by neither one of us being great with  using github.  We did work well together and made good progress considering my limited time on the weekend.  Brandon had some understandable anxiety over this (as did I) but I think we both learned to set up more specific scheduling/logistics with future pairing projects.

#### (IdeaBox)

## D: Professional Skills
  
  The professional skills development curriculam in module 1 taught me a lot about how to present myself to employers both online and in person. I was shown how to set up my LinkedIn account as well as the content I should feature in my account. I also learned a lot about how to tell my story and why I'm trying to enter this new industry.

### Gear Up
#### Health and Wellness

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

In this Gear Up we spoke about the different kinds of stress and about stress we've experienced in the past. This gearup definitley gave me a new perspective on the different kind of stress I've experienced in the past. It was also enlightening to hear about how other people in the room have experienced and managed stress.

#### Code 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

  This gear up was awesome. We spoke about a topic that really needs to be addressed in the tech industry and culture alike. We talked about the gap of oppurtunity and utilization between white men and all disenfranchised groups including women and people of different color or sexual orientation. It's a topic I've thought long and hard about in the past and it was cool to have that conversation with like-minded individuals that I agree with. It got me thinking and it begged the question: Is it possible for us to bridge this gap utilizing the influence of the tech industry?
  I believe it can be done.

#### Biohacking

  I thouroughly enjoyed this presentation. The Mod 4 humans did a very good job facilitating an envirement to have a conversation about a normally obscure topic. I love talking and thinking about themes and ideas surrounding transhumanism and it's a conversation that I don't get to have to often with people who are as enthusiastic about it as I am. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I've stayed very engaged during class, always asking clarify questions that other people might be having. I have also kept very open communication with my cohortmates asking for help and taking time to give help if someone asks me. I've found that I fit into the Turing community as a whole quite well and am enjoying my time here.
