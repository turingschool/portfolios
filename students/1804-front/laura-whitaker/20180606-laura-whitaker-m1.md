## Notes/What To Work On:

- Make sure to do a DTR every project

## Functionality
- Through Phase III

## Comp Recreation/Design
- Overall good recreation of the comp 
- Minor details to polish
- Letters are kind of big

## Git/GitHub
- Would like to see more commits
- Continue to push forward with more description in body of commit
- Nice job deleting branches after finishing

## HTML
- Add lang attribute to your HTML
- Run through a screenreader
- Nice formatting

## CSS
- Add comments to your CSS for organization
- Nice job organizing declarations alphabetically. Look into [idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) for organization as well
- Work on naming for your classes in HTML so that it's easy to follow naming as CSS selectors. Two popular options are [BEM](http://getbem.com/) and [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) 

## JS
- Code is very easy to follow
- Some opportunities for refactoring and pulling out functionality specific to counter and updating UI

## Functional Expectations

* Proficient: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

## Partner Feedback 
I really appreciated how much effort you put into this project to make it as good as possible. You also did a great job with much of the styling in our project and I think it was great how open you were to my input throughout the project as well. Possibly one thing to keep in mind for the future, and I was at fault for this too, is to be a little more open with communication in terms of what you're planning on doing and then that way, I can know what to work on as a result. This was only a minor issue, overall I think we worked well with one another and it was a pleasure working with you!

## Student: Laura and Kiel
## Evaluator: David Whitaker
## Notes/What To Work On:

* Excellent comp implementation

### HTML
* Great use of aria-label and aria-required
* Look more into bem block: form, element: form__input, modifier: form__input-title

### CSS
* Consider adding organizational comments and leveraging container elements more

### JS
* Look for duplication, pull out into its own function and pass dynamic info as arguments
* Pass objects as arguments instead of properties of objects for maintainability
* Idea, not createIdea

### Git/Github
* Say more, do more commits

## Functional Expectations

* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

## HTML

## Accessibility

* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

## Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
* Exceptional Crafts lean, efficient markup and can speak directly to choices made to improve performance, including but not limited to, page load times, css/js optimizations, image optimizations.

## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

## Implementation

* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.
* Exceptional Can articulate rationale for all parts of the CSS implementation (each line of code/CSS rule) specifically in regards to the balance of: structure of code, design integrity, performance.

## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

## Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

## Functions & Scope

* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

## Arrays

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

## Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

## DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style

* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

## Github

* Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.
* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
* Exceptional Developer skillfully captures the spirit and design intent of all comp details. Execution is pixel-perfect and any design decisions left open to interpretation are solved intentionally, are as seamless as if the designer had provided the solution, are handled gracefully, and enhance the overall design.


## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

## TERMINOLOGY

## Technical Vocab

* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.

## Students: James Laura
## Evaluator: Nathaniel
## Notes/What To Work On:

Functional
add feedback for save button, not working
prevent more than 120 letters from being typed
re-enable save button if less than 120 letters

2 extensions

Aria
Make sure to use Aria on all interactive

Be very careful with floats, if you need to float right, try to use flexbox

JS
Storing ideas in an array before putting in localStorage
When using ternaries in if/else statements consider combining the conditional from the ternary and the conditional from the if statement e.g. the conditional in changeImportance

HTML
use header/footer

Practice vocabulary

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Health and Wellness

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

A lot of the content of this gear up was quite familiar to me, but I think it is always helpful to be reminded to take care of ourselves. In future mods, I would like to make sure I get more exercise and also force myself to take more breaks from coding on the weekends. 

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

While I think this film could have had more representation of people across the gender spectrum, I do think it touched on a lot of important points. The gender gap was one of the things that initially scared me away from programing and being in a community that openly discusses it has abated some of that fear.  

#### AI Carumba with Mod4

It was interesting to learn about were AI is at (or isn't at) and also get other people's perspectives of different implementations of it. People have pretty strong opinions about it, but I found my stance a little ambiguous. There is so much potential for good, but I feel that it is very susceptible to being used in negative ways. 

### Professional Development
#### Into to StrengthsFinder

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/intro_strengthsfinder_session.md)

My strengths were empathetic, futuristic, restorative, intellection, and responsibility. I never would have picked restorative for myself, but after some reflection I realized that I do enjoy leaving things better than I found them. Overall, I feel these strengths will serve me well as a developer and I hope to draw from them often.

#### Working Styles

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/working_styles.md)

I am definitely more of an introvert, but can be more extroverted if needed. It was helpful to see everyone else's working styles and be able to support an awareness of the differences. Although I like to work by myself, I think it is very beneficial to actually work with others and I plan on making sure I show up in person for projects. 

#### Learning to Pair

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md)
* [DTRs](https://gist.github.com/laurakwhit/d3336ccd7f42d591fa60606967b036cd)

This is something I still need to work on. My strength of responsibility sometimes takes over and I have a hard time delegating work. Communication is fine, but division of workload has been uneven. 

#### Feedback

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/feedback_i.md)

I found this very helpful, as I have the hardest time giving critical feedback. If I do, I tend to sandwich it between compliments. Hopefully as I get more comfortable in my abilities I will be able to voice more honest feedback.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

As part of the Student Advisory Board (SAB), I was able to help brainstorm for community wide events at Turing and co-lead weekly cohort retros. I also attended school wide events, such as the social and code fair, as well as weekly meetings with the Joan Clarke Society. Going forward, I would like to look into joining more posses and meeting students from other cohorts.
