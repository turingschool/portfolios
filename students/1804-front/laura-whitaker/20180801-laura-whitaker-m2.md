## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This was my second time serving on the Student Advisory Board (SAB), where I continued to help brainstorm for community wide events at Turing and co-lead weekly cohort retros. I also helped with the voting booth at the code fair and attended the Turing Bake Off. I went to weekly meetings with the Joan Clarke Society and attended Iron FE at least once a week. Being in Mod 2 meant I was also able to pair with students in Mod 1 and help with their projects.
