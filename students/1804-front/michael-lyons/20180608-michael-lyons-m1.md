# Michael Lyons - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for module 1 were simple. I wanted to get a better grasp on the following: how to operate in the terminal, solve the riddle that is GitHub, use HTML/CSS to style pages, and learn how to write functions using javaScript. I had done a fair amount of pre-work coming into Turing, but I lacked an understanding of how those concepts would be applied when actually programming. Keeping this in mind, it was soon obvious I knew nothing. Beyond all that, I wanted to take advantage of all that Turing has to offer and to integrate myself fully into the community. I knew that in order to be successful at Turing I would have to fully commit in every facet of my life. At this point out of everything I've listed above, my commitment has been total without question.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod, we worked on 4 projects individually. They were a NumberGuesser application and a few CSS-heavy static composition challenges. 

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelyons/number-guesser/tree/master/Desktop/mod1/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser is an application designed to generate a random number on load. This number is between 1 and 100. The goal is to guess the number that the program generates. You are given hints if it is too low or too high and you must go from there to solve.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

In Groups we built some cool applications this mod, and in this section, I will showcase Linked-List, Idea-Box, and 2Do-Box-Pivot.

#### Linked-List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelyons/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List is a jQuery powered application that grabs and displays a user's bookmarked web pages.

#### Idea-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelyons/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Idea-Box is a jQuery note taking application that allows the user to sort their ideas based quality and can search through the list to find the specific idea that they want. We created functionality that stores their ideas in the browser's local storage.

######  Pamela Lovett's Evaluation

#### 2Do-Box-Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelyons/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

2Do-Box-Pivot is a jQuery note taking application that is an extension of the linked list application mentioned previously. The biggest challenge for this project entailed be given an anonymous idea-box code base from a former student and refactoring the code for clarity and functionality. We also created additional functionality beyond the scope of the idea-box application. These extensions included adding an importance level for the 2do's and editing the existing 2do's while at the same time getting the edits to persist in local storage.

## D: Professional Skills

In mod1, we focused on building complete LinkedIn, GitHub, and Stack Overflow profiles, and additionally exploring our personal strengths using the StrengthsFinder application. We also focused on how to maintain a healthy head space using meditation and mental health accountability buddies.

### Gear Up
#### (Mental Health 101)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

I realized very quickly how critical tending to your mental health is while at Turing. I love that we discussed it as a community because it made me feel like I am not the only one who has a tough time maintaining a good head space. Programming is very difficult for me in general and without the fundamental understanding that I can and will get better but I just have to remain calm when faced with adversity, I don't see how I could have dealt with the stress and completed the module.

#### (Code Debugging The Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

The film and subsequent discussion from this session provided me with several takeaways that have made me much more aware of the dynamics that exist within the tech scene. Understanding the basis for the lack of diversity in tech allowed me to frame my own position currently in tech and also understand why diversity is important when developing web applications. 

#### (Public Data)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1804inning/public_data.md)

Being able to not only learn from, but also interact with the much more experienced module 4 members was a fantastic experience on it's own. When coupled with a fascinating topic like public data, the takeaways were many for this gear up session. Briefly, my biggest takeaway was in regards to the dissemination of data and how to validate data once you receive from a database. Public data in many cases in not as accessible as you might think and being exposed to this early on allowed me to re-frame how I will handle data from public sources in future projects. Another issue that was mentioned was in regards to the source of the data and it's validity, even when the data is coming from government sources. Many times data is provided but not authenticated when placed into the database. By knowing this, I will be able to tread carefully in the future, not simple taking all data at face value. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During this module, I tried to integrate myself into the Turing Community as much as possible. I was elected as 1 of 2 student advisory board leaders for my mod, attended a codeFair, joined a posse, attended many lunch study sessions lead by mod 2 students, showed up for a Denver tech meet-up, and had a generally capital time.
