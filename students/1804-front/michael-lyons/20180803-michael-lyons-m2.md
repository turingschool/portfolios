# Michael Lyons - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for module 2 were similiar, but different from Mod 1. I knew we were taking a deep dive into computer science, so I was intimated but also excited. Beyond all that, I wanted to continue to take advantage of all that Turing has to offer and to integrate myself more fully into the community.

## A: End of Module Assessment

PASSING

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This inning, I worked on several projects individually. Here, I will showcase a few chic sorting algorithm projects.

#### Complete-Me

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelyons/complete-me)
- [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

In this project we built a low level version of an auto complete system in JavaScript. Initially, the program was designed to take a word into the trie and keep count of how many words have been inserted. Once the words were in the trie, we designed a suggest method to take a word prefix and return different options based on words that matched the initial prefix. Once we had our suggest method functioning, we populated our trie with a apple default dictionary to provide a library for our suggest method.

Nathaniel failed to give me an eval :(

#### Sorting-Suite

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelyons/sorting-suite)
- [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

In this project I built 3 different sorting algorithms:

BubbleSort: Bubble sort works by moving through an array of data and iteratively moving the largest number to the end of the array.

InsertionSort: Insertion sort works by adding items to a sorted array. Typically sorting is done in place inside the array which needs sorting. The first element in the array becomes the sorted array. We iterate through the set to be sorted, pulling one element at a time, then inserting it into its correct position in the sorted section of the array.

QuiteSort: With quick sort we take an array and choose one of the indexes as a pivot. We then want to move all the elements larger than the pivot to the right of the pivot and all the items smaller than the pivot to the left. After moving all the elements to either side of the pivot our pivot will be in the correct spot. Now all the larger elements can be quick sorted and all the smaller elements can be quick sorted.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This inning, we worked on several projects in 2 person teams. Here, I will showcase a few chic projects.

#### GameTime

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelyons/game-time)
- [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Paul and I built an awesome 80's throwback version of the classic arcade game TRON. We built it using vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas and it was so fun.

##### Evaluation Comments

Functional Expectations
4/4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors. Github pages deploy & level up extensions complete, nice!

User Interface
3.5/4 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. Little difficult to tell when the scores were updating on each collision. Nitpick about the skewing of the trails vertically vs. horizontally

Testing
3/4 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.
(evaluation scores)

JavaScript Style & OOP
3/4 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.

Workflow
3/4 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.

#### Weathrly

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelyons/weathrly)
- [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Haley and I built an awesome weather forecasting application in ReactJs. This was our first real interaction with ReactJS, asynchronous javascript, and managing the state of our application.

##### Evaluation Comments

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod, I've really immersed myself in the Turing community. I continued my involvement with with SAB as one of 2 elected representatives from our cohort. I joined Iron-FE, which met every morning to tackle complex javaScript problems. I also met with a meditation group most Wednesdays and practiced for thirty minutes. I tried to put myself out there as much as possible and I feel as though it really paid off. What a challenging but great mod.
