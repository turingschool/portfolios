# Dennis Miller - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out this mod to try and grow on the skills I had learned from mod 1, and work as hard as possible to understand the concepts taught in mod 2. I wanted to have a good grasp on array prototypes and understand the basics of react before going on into mod 3.

The Game Time project wanted us to build the Tron game using html canvas and focused on using object oriented programming. The game had two players and was won if one of the player crashed into a wall, themselves, or the other players trail.

The Weathrly project wanted us to build a webiste that displayed the current weather for a city based on the user's search. This was our first time our project needed to be built in React. The site needed to display the current weather for that day, a seven hour forecast along with a 10 day forecast.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Coming from mod 1 where a big reason for my succeess was pairing with the mod ahead of us, I wanted to make sure I offered the same opportunity to the mod 1 students. I've learned from being a student at turing that a big reason for students passing a mod is getting help from the community, it solidifies previous learned concepts and at the same time your helping some one else get a better understanding of that concept
