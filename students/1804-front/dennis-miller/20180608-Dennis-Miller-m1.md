# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out this mod to learn and try and soak in as much as possible information as possible. My goal was to have a full understanding of the content from the mod and feel comfortable applying these concepts. A personal goal was to pass mod 1.

### Number Guesser

#### (Project Name)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dmiller1623/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

The number guesser project asked us to build a game that generates a random number and has the user input a guess and checks to see if that number matches the random number, or if that guess is to high or to low.

#### Static Comps

I was given three static comp challenges, which asked us to recreate the layout that was provided. Also to have the site be responsive on a mobile layout. We had some creative license but the main goal was for our project look similar to the comp provided.

Linked List asked us to build an apllication with two input fields that allowed the user to enter a title and link. On submit a card with the title and link needed to be displayed on the page. Each bookmark needed a button that marked as read and deleted.

## D: Professional Skills
### Gear Up

### #Mental Health 101


* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

In this gear up I learned that there's many types of stress and many different ways of handling your stress. Throughout the mod i was stressed out with the amount of work that was being put on us. Looking back I was less comfortable with being stressed in the beggining of the mod but as the weeks went on, I found different ways of handling that stress. The gear up deffinatley helped me discover new ways of handling.

#### Code Debugging the Gender Gap 

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

This Gear Up pointed out that there is a huge gender gap in the tech industry. The movie we watched pointed out many flaws of how not having both sides of an argument can affect the outcome of a problem. The example that was showed was that women were dying when a cars airbag was deployed because the designers were using male sized crash dummies and not accounting for smaller women. I think with a mainly male environment its easy to behave in the work as like it wis a "locker room" in order to change that acting respectufully and making it a comfortable environment for gender to work in will help with debugging the gender gap.

#### Public Data

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1804inning/public_data.md)

We learned about civic tech and public data we discussed where and how public data is accessed. Also we went over what kind of barriers there are when dealing with public data. We also went of a bunch of projects that were involved in civic tech. We looked over how they're helping the community.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Since the beggining of the mod I knew that the community was very strong here. It seemed like everyone was very close, even though I'm not the most social person I tried my best to get out of my shell. I went to meetups outside of class to meet with people from different mods. I tried to be friendly and welcoming to everyone I encountered at turing. Also cleaned up after my self and helped out in the kitchen when needed. I would like to keep meeting new people and help around the community as much as possible.
