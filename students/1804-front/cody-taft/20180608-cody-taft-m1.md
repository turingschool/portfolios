## B: Individual Work & Projects

These are my Turing Mod1 Projects

#### Number Guesser

* https://github.com/codytaft/number-guesser
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

The project was to build a number guesser game, in which someone guesses a nunber that is randomly generated.  They also have the opportunity to set a min and max and for their game.

**Evaluation Comments**

* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

This was a paired project that I completed with Brian Tiedt.  It was a program in which the user could type in a Title and a Link and it would display in a list.

**Evaluation Comments**

**HTML**
*Use aria labels on inputs!

**CSS**
*Pull duplicate declarations into their own class
*Consider using more organizational comments
*Lots of inconsistencies - look at the style guides!

**JS**
*Lots of inconsistencies with indentation and semicolons - look at the style guides!
*Could be a bit more descriptive with naming conventions

**Feedback To Me**
*Cody I truly enjoyed paring with you on the Linked-list project, I really enjoyed seeing your thought process and how you would take the time to breakdown the issue at hand the implement a solution. In addition you have a great demeanor and attitude. With the understanding that this was your first paring project, I think you did a wonderful job overall. Moving forward I believe if you are more vocal in your opinion and the direction you'd like to take, I have no doubt that you will be very successful here at Turing and moving forward into your new career. Thank You.

##### Idea Box

* https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1804/mod-1/idea-box/kent-cody.md
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

This was a paired project that I completed with Kent Huntsman.  It started with an input field for a Title and Idea.  This was then displayed and also needed to persist on the page by storing into local storage. We would then manipulate by deleting individual entries and changing the qualities of them. There was also a search function.

**Evaluation Comments**

**HTML**
*Nice job with semantic HTML
*Add labels to input
*Run through a screenreader

**GIT/GITHUB**
*More commits
*Be verbose in bodies of commits - what are you doing/what has changed?
*Nice job with working on feature branches

**CSS**
*Box-sizing on * instead of body
*Remove max-width on body to account for larger screens
*Avoid vw/vh on elements like cards so that cards can maintain integrity
*Remove empty selectors

**JS**
*Great job talking through codebase
*Keep master branch free of console logs and commented out code that isn't implemented
*No need to return false in 166
*Only pass in changing values as arguments in 76 - no need to send as object literal

**Evaluation Scores**

**HTML**
**Accessibility**
*Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

**Style**
*Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

**CSS**
**Structure of Code**
*Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
*Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

**Implementation**
*Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

**JAVASCRIPT**
**Data Types**
*Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

**Conditional Logic**
*Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.
*Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

**Functions & Scope**
*Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

**Arrays**
*Proficient Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

**Objects & Prototypes**
*Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
*Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

**DOM Manipulation**
*Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

**Style**
*Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

**GIT & GITHUB**
**Git**
*Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

**Github**
*Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

**DESIGN**
**Comp Recreation**
*Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

**PAIRING**
**Collaboration**
*Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

**TERMINOLOGY**
**Technical Vocab**
*Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.


##### ToDo Box

* https://github.com/codytaft/CT-DM-2DoBox
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html

This was a paired project that I completed with Dennis Miller. It was a pivot from Idea Box in which we had someone elses code and were required torefacture and then change the project to a a ToDo list that was earchable.

**Evaluation Comments**

**HTML**
*Get rid of those  s!
*Good addition of aria-labels
*Like that you switched to 2 space tabs instead of 4

**CSS**
*Add organizational comments
*Remove ids as they are too specific
*dry it up

**JS**
*Look at the style guide
*Work on naming conventions!
*Be more descriptive
*Keep data model separate from how it is displayed on the page
*Pluralize properly ie. parsedObjects is a singular object so call it parsedObject
*dry it up
*single responsibility

## D: Professional Skills
These are the professional skill classes that we engaged in throught module 1.

### Gear Up
#### (Mental Health 101)

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md

##### Mental health is still constantly on my mind. As I look back at my notes I am refreshed on what i was thinking during the gear-up. I still need to focus on time management, inclduing making sure im blocking out time for meal prep.  During the module I also met with the counselor Jun and was remindded that I would like to create time to reflect, relax, and metaphorically and maybe literally just sit under a tree, if only for a few minutes, because i do have those moments if I make them.

### Gear Up
#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md

##### This gear-up was very informative and I had the most engaging talks within it.  In my group there were diverse individuals and the most interesting was an age gap as well as a gender gap. I was informed of their mindsets and an age bias in the tech world.  It was very nice to see there points of view and we all got to this agreement about the need for lack iof judgment on the surface, because in this industry the mind is what matters, and it takes time to get know whats undedr the hood of a person.  It's cliche about not judgiung a book by its cover, and a beautiful dream to end prejudices but its absoultely ridiculous and  requires patience, to understand people and make decisions. 

### Gear Up
#### Self-Doubt

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1804inning/self_doubt.md

##### In this session we go into great conversations about the use of prublic data and what can be done with it to help people in need. There are many problems in the world and its amazing how many solutions appear as soon as people start talking about them and thinking about solutions.  We began talking about homlessness and ways to create hubs and technologies to connect both services offered or needed to people that need or can provide them.  With technology abundant there are so many solututions and so much data in the world that just needs to be utilized in new and unique ways. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I have been trying to engage with as many Turing Students as possible. There are things that I know that others don't and vice versa so its so beneficial to connect with others and be scaffolding for each others growth.  The community gatherings are fantastic to build a sense of comradery.  Though time is short here much time is spent with the same people and I feel I help build community and conenctions with others and hopefully ease peoples stress during this time at turing.
