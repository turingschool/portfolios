## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Below are the projects I worked on this module)

#### (CompleteMe)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/codytaft/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

(This project was a solo project in which I created an Autofill based on a TRIE data structure.  There is an insert method for sorting words into the tree as well as a suggest method that would suggest a word based on letters typed. It has no front end and relies soley on tests.)
