# James Burbage - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I really wanted to absorb as much information as possible and pass the module. I also wanted to be confident in developing. The process of breaking complicated problems down seemed simple in my unrelated previous life experiences, but in web development, seemed overwhelming. I wanted a better grasp at how to tackle my learning in this new feild.

### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/james-burbage/jb-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

Description
* The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, you’ll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Don’t worry, we’ll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer’s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

### Static Comp 2

#### My Feedback

 * I had a great time working with you! I thought we got along really well and it made the project more fun to work on for both of us. I could tell you have good attention to detail, and you were able to notice quickly when a word was wrong or something was in the wrong spot. You were picking up concepts quickly and came in with the clutch recursion idea at the end of the project! You also were very eager to get your javascript knowledge up and dove into the codeacademy lesson, which I thought was cool. I would encourage you to try to get better muscle memory for writing javascript in proper formatting and really keeping in mind where everything is opening and closing. So if someone says "lets make a function with a conditional that takes these 2 parameters and call it using these arguments on this event listener", you can write it out without having to think too much about the syntax. Keep up the codeacademy javascript lesson and also try to take the javascript file we wrote together and put it side-by-side with a blank file, and just type it out over and over again and really try to understand what every line is doing each time you type it. Then do it a few times without looking at the original. 

### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/james-burbage/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Description
* Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

#### Evaluation Comments

* Solid comp implementation

HTML
* Good use of aria-labels - really only needed on inputs though

CSS
* Consider adding organizational comments
* Consider pulling duplicate declarations into a more broad class rule
* Make sure you're using google fonts correctly

JS
* Pseudo code more and possibly use a checklist
* Separate the data model from the markup - ie. Idea instead of IdeaCard

#### Evaluation scores

* Novice  Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.

HTML

Accessibility

* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

CSS

Structure of Code

* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

Implementation

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

JAVASCRIPT

Data Types

* Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.

Conditional Logic

* Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.

Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

Arrays

* Novice  Can create array and use array indexing to extract data from array or modify array. Comfortable using arrays to store simple data types: numbers, booleans, or strings.
* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

DOM Manipulation

* Novice  Can articulate what the DOM is and can effectively target elements in vanilla JavaScript via class, id, or tag.
* Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.

Style

* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

GIT & GITHUB

Git

* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.

Github

* Novice  Can articulate what GitHub is, how it is different from Git, and why it is important. Can comfortably push and/or pull changes from master.
* Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.

DESIGN

Comp Recreation

* Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

PAIRING

Collaboration

* Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.
* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

TERMINOLOGY

Technical Vocab

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate what is going on in the overall codebase and uses the correct terminology some of the time.
* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.

#### My Feedback

 * James did a great job of staying focused and identifying attainable goals to accomplish for our project. Moving forward your pairings will be more successful with keeping an open mind and thinking out your process with your partner. These projects are meant to make us better, and your partner wants to get better just as much as you, so I would be empathetic to your partner in those regards. 

### 2DoBox

#### My Feedback
 * I really appreciated your willingness to stay in contact (even over the weekend) and stay after class to work together. I know being sick definitely didn't help, but I think going forward it might be beneficial to dive into the javascript a little more. Even if you don't work on a piece of code, I think it is always a good idea to know why it's there. This could just mean sitting down with your partner and making sure that you know exactly what it is doing. All in all, it was a pleasure working with you James and I look forward to collaborating again in the future!

## D: Professional Skills

Intro
 * Turing's mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. Our vision is a world powered by technology where the people building it represent the people using it. We're here to build a movement.

 * In order to advance this mission and vision, our curriculum transcends technical training. We also present students with opportunities to grow as individuals, members of a team, and members of a community.

 * Gear Up provides a forum for students to develop self-awareness, interpersonal skills, and gain awareness of the issues preventing tech from being an inclusive space.

### Gear Up
#### Health and Wellness

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

Takeaways
 * Stress can consume us and there are different types of stress. Stress management is something I need to work on.

### Gear Up
#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

Takeaways
 * Women in the workforce are judged more than men and women may not realize it due to the 'normality' behind it. More women leave their tech careers in 10 years than men due to constant harassment and to non-promotions due to gender inequality. Obviously women are not being given the same opportunities as men in tech, and are mostly pushed away at a young age.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was always willing to help my classmates when I could. I also enjoyed pairing and meeting with my mentor. I love the tech community as a whole and want to go to more meetups.
