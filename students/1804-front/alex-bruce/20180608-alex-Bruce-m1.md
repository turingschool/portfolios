# (Alex Bruce) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to gain a more well-rounded understanding of all concepts introduced in the module, but especially with an emphasis on javascript, unit testing, objects, and prototypes. The biggest thing I wanted to accomplish though, was to reevaluate the way I learn. It’s taken some time for me to figure out the best ways to spend my time and energy in a productive manner. Since I’ve never been in a learning environment this intense, I wanted to retrain my brain to be able to take in the amount of information I’m being given.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual projects this mod included Number Guesser and the three Static Comps

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was the first major project this module, and it introduced vanilla JavaScript functionality. A random number between 1 and 100 was generated, and the user would try to guess the number with text inputs. Depending on whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct, the interface would interact with the user, giving them hints.

evaluation comments:
- Indentations needed in html
- Add aria-labels to all inputs
- fieldset instead of article in form
- Pull duplicate css declaration blocks into another class
- Love the transitions!
- js - dry it up! 2 or more lines in a row in multiple places should be pulled out into their own function
- Naming conventions

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/ab-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

The Static Comp projects were given in the form of a screenshot of a webpage. The idea was to use HTML and CSS to recreate the basic layout of the page, both testing our abilities with precise css, and our creativity with styling. The first Static Comp had a checkerboard-style grouping of elements. It was a good starting point that gave students an opportunity to learn about CSS Flexbox and Grid. It also required the use of media queries for the first time, so students had to learn not only how to make them, but also how to use their creativity to make a functional and attractive page layout, regardless of the screen size.

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/AB-Comp-Challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

The Static Comp projects were given in the form of a screenshot of a webpage. The idea was to use HTML and CSS to recreate the basic layout of the page, both testing our abilities with precise css, and our creativity with styling. The second Static Comp was a more straight-forward layout, but had a lot more elements to keep track of. The styling was based on what you may see on a social media page.

#### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/AB-Comp-Challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

The Static Comp projects were given in the form of a screenshot of a webpage. The idea was to use HTML and CSS to recreate the basic layout of the page, both testing our abilities with precise css, and our creativity with styling. The third Static Comp was by far the largest and most time-consuming. It had a unique layout, with a lot of elements which had to interact with each other properly, have hover states, and be responsive.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We were given three major group projects this module. They were meant to give us a functional understanding of vanilla Javascript, JQuery, JSON, localStorage, several of the concepts within each of these, and an 

#### (Linked List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/Linked-List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List gave us our first real look at pushing items onto the DOM. It was also a good introduction to JQuery. We created a list of website bookmarks that could be marked as read or deleted, individually.

evaluation comments:
- Make sure to do a DTR every project

[evaluation scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1804/mod-1/linked-list/tim-alex.md)

feedback to me:
```Your knowledge of template literal and DOM manipulation was extremely helpful to this project. Your ability to speak to your code not only showed your experience, but also helped me to learn. I think there were certain times in the project when we were stuck and hesitated to reach out for help. While we figured things out eventually, asking for assistance may have led to a quicker solution.```

#### (IdeaBox)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

IdeaBox introduced us to localStorage. It was also the first project this mod that I used JQuery on. The assignment was to create a system for posting, manipulating, and storing ideas locally. This meant that any previously created ideas had to be visible on the page after reloading.

evaluation comments:
- Functional problem searching body Add empty items
- HTML use article for cards or other semantic tag love the aria-labels use aria-labels for save button
- CSS get rid of stuff that is not necessary justify-content/align-items only effect elements with display: flex
- JS Add local copy of jquery use return with map dry up repetitive code

#### (2DoBox Pivot)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

2DoBox-Pivot was a project based around repurposing code written by another developer. We were given an IdeaBox project from a former Turing student, and had to modify it, first to complete all functional expectations, but then also to pivot it into a list if to-dos.

evaluation comments:
- Functionality Partial Phase 2
- UI Line up boxes with Input form
- HTML consider using a main element
- CSS Clean up, remove unused css, lookout for strange values e.g. font-size: 275%
- JS Remove unused functions, localStoreCard?? Use jquery consistently for dom manipulation, e.g [0] Don't wrap item multiple times in jquery Make sure you are using all parameters defined in a function
- GIT More descriptive log messages, use imperative mood, present tense use git to rename files to save git history

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Health and Wellness)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

I found the Health and wellness Gear-Up to be very valuable, especially in a fast-paced environment like Turing. I think it's very important to find ways to manage stress, and I haven't always been great at that. I've tried to be better about habits because of this. Sleeping, healthy eating, and working out are the three main areas that I've tried to focus on. And overall, I've definitely improved.

#### (Code 2.0)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

I believe diversity is incredibly important to every industry, and tech is no different. That said, I found this gear-up very valuable. It was very interesting to talk to my fellow students, hear about their backgrounds, and hear their thoughts about diversity. There were some examples in the video we watched that show specifically why diversity is so important, and I think it was a great thing for everybody to see. Both times I've gone through this gear-up, I found it interesting and important to talk about.

#### (Self Doubt)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1804inning/self_doubt.md)

I've learned a lot about self-doubt over the years, and especially in this gear-up. I've struggled with it countless times. This Gear-up was probably my favorite one that I've been to because it really gave me answers on how to manage self-doubt. I've been practicing positivity, inward and outward, and I've already noticed a difference. My goal is to continuously improve and reflect on what I've taken from this session. I think it'll be very valuable in my future as a developer.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I'm very happy with the part that I played in the cohort and the Turing community. I was often a person who people would reach out to if they had questions, and I also became friends with everybody in the cohort, which I didn't nevessarily do last mod. I made it a point to be more social and come out of my shell, which is typically a hard thing for me to do. I wanted to make it a comfortable envoronment for myself and others. I think I succeeded, and am very proud of that.
