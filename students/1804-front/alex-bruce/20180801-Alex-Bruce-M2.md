## B: Individual Work & Projects



#### (Complete-Me)

* [GitHub](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

Complete-Me was a project meant to give an introduction to prefix tries and to create an autocomplete system, which would later be implemented in Weathrly. It was an interesting way to visualize and create a relatively complex data structure.

Evaluation comments: Struggled with talking through thought process/articulation without reverting back to code. More pracitce with whiteboarding would be good

Evaluation scores:
- Process: 2.75
- Fundamental JS & style: 3
- TDD & Code Sanitation: 2.75
- functional expectations: 3

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Both of the two group projects this module were created to focus on multiple newly learned aspects of development for the students. They also helped with our skills of working together in groups, 

#### (Game-Time)

* [GitHub](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Game-Time was an introductory project for HTML Canvas and ES6 syntax, as well as a deeper dive into object oriented JavaScript than we had really seen before, especially when considering the new class/constructor structure introduced with ES6. With my project in particular, Laura and I created Frogger.

Evaluation notes:
- Both articulated their knowledge of classes/OOP very well
- Little too many things in the index.js that could be moved into the Game class but overall classes seemed well-structured and they each had appropriate methods and instance properties on them

Evaluation scores:
- Function Expectations: 3.5
- User Interface: 3.5
- Testing: 3
- JS Style and OOP: 3

Feedback to me:
- Don't autoplay music
- give more emphasis on the game/less on instructions
- keep track of lives

#### (Weathrly)

* [GitHub](https://github.com/kmiller9393/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Weathrly was our first project where we used React. It was made to show us the power of components, class, props, and general React syntax. It also gave us a look at API fetch calls, by pulling in live weather data to make a functional web weather application.

Evaluation comments and scores are still pending
