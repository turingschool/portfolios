# FIRST LAST - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

During Module 1, I hoped to gain a firm understanding of the basic concepts of ruby. I envisioned learning the fundamentals of programming, TDD, and Git. Not only do I feel I was able to accomplish a foundational understanding of these concepts, but I was able to grow as a person and team member as well.

###Notes
* Reflecting on all that I have accomplished this module, overall I believe I was successful in all areas and learned a lot.
* The link I provided for Jungle Beat is being updated. (play method now works)

## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

[DTR Memo Head Count](https://gist.github.com/chantal66/591f21d746d650deadf560e184d0d2a8) to DTR Memo from 1 paired project.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

#### Project 1 (Larisa Anderson):

**Feedback for Larisa:**

> During the week of our pairing project I saw how invested you are in learning and even though you say it's not clicking believe me it is, Your brain is doing the job in the background, one of this days you will have that elusive AHAA!! moment that we all love. Also I would like to add that maybe for your next time, take into consideration the type of person your partner is, since you are an extrovert and I'm an introvert I felt pressured to work in your style instead of the way that works the best for me. I do have say that when we divided our tasks, me the key-maker , Larisa the Offset generator, you did a wonderful job reaching out to the right people and fulfilled the job in timely manner, communication is also one of your strengths to be proud of. Lastly, I would like to add that I’m very proud of your performance during our evaluation, it showed how much you've learned.

**Feedback from Larisa:**

> When I found out I was paired with Chantal, I felt a wave of relief sweep over my body. How lucky was I to be paired with such and understanding, smart, and friendly person. We made our DTR, and we both knew that because of my lack of experince it was going to be a tough project to both feel that we we're going to be able to contribute equally. We started out working together, and we decided that we were going to divide and concour. Looking back I feel that this wasn't the best way to start our project. Reason being is I needed to be able to see the ins and outs of the code to help me understand the problem. I started to work on the project with Dave Maurer, and invited Chantal to work with us. We decided that we should stop moving forward until I was able to catch up. I am not sure if this was the best idea for the project, but it made sense at the time. Chantal, I really appreciated your work on the project. You were very commited to finding the answer to the problems. I know that this dedication to coding will take you far. You also have a great gift in pateince, and believe me I know all about patience. Had you been a partner that wasn't able to take a step back and genuinly care that I was apart of the project it would have turned out badly for us both.

#### Project 2 (Yohanan Assefa):

**Feedback for Yohanan:**

> I honestly don't have any negative feedback! I think we were good about switching roles, picking up each other's slack when we were brain-dead & dividing and conquering. We never surrended to Head count, even when we had to refactor iteration zero 3 times frustration never took the best from us, we kept fighting it and winning. I would like to add It was a real pleasure working with you! The fact that you were so willing to put every last minute of your free time into this project was highly motivating.

**Feedback from Yohanan:**

> I honestly don't have any negative feedback!  I know we are supposed to give suggestions on how we could improve but I can’t think of a single area where you could have given more, you’re effort was outstanding.  I think we were good about switching roles, picking up each other's slack when we were brain-dead & dividing and conquering. We never surrendered to Head Count, even when we had to refactor iteration zero 3 times. Frustration never got the best of us, we kept fighting it and winning.  I would like to add It was a real pleasure working with you!  The fact that you were so willing to put every last minute of your free time into this project was highly motivating.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset

I really enjoyed the Gear Up session on growth mindset. Attending Turing requires that not only your brain but body and soul are in Growth Mindset state as well. It doesn't matter how smart you are, a fixed mindset will not allow growth.  If you add a bad attitude to that, you'll be in big trouble. Keeping the GM can be challenging but it is a thing that I try to keep track of because I have learned how important it is. I also try to pay attention to my wins, it doesn't matter big or small is a win, it needs to be celebrated. If mind and body are connected everything will work out.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things

The Gear Up session on getting better at difficult things introduced me to another new concept - cognitive load. I find it fascinating that cognitive load can affect the way you learn, especially the reaction of your brain when cognitive resources are being wasted. Before starting Turing, my wife and I made some preparations so I wouldn’t waste resources. We didn’t have a name for it back then so I was encouraged by the fact that we were moving in the right direction.

The lady in the video presented 3 ways of learning: the things we can’t do but need to learn, things we can do, but require effort, and then the things we have “mastered” and don’t need to think about much.  I believe this has helped me to succeed on mod-1, to focus on and conquer my weaknesses in code.


#### Session 3: Introvert vs. Extrovert

This Gear Up could've not come in a better moment!  It helped me understand how this idea can affect the way we were paired for our group projects.  It is so important to understand your pairing partner, to get to know his/her best way of working as well as my own.  Once you figure that out you can try to reach to a middle ground.  In this session we also saw how important it is for active listening to be in place in both sides of the DTR. These were lessons as valuable as any code I have learned at Turing.

#### Session 4: Strengths & Storytelling

During this session we answered questions about why we want to be developers, why we chose Turing, what lenses we see the world through and how are values are involved in our decision making. I was able to realize that even though I am from another country I could see that we (other students and myself) are more similar than different; we all share a passion for learning, at some point we all got bored with our jobs because they stopped being challenging. I’m convinced this could never happen at Turing nor in the coding world. I chose Turing because we share values like inclusiveness, personal growth/learning, creativity and honesty. This is one of best decisions I’ve ever made. (I have to say “one of” in case my wife reads this.)


#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap

I appreciate that Turing shows this film to all students. I was moved by the video and had a hard time believing that this can still happened to women in 2017. However women have been fighting the gender gap since FOREVER!, we need to keep pushing and as in other industries we need to research to place where we want to work, they are not only interviewing us, we are interviewng them. We need to join a company in which we believe we share we have the same standards and ethics.

### Community Participation

I thought I would struggle with this mod since it’s always been difficult for me to speak up in community settings.  However, because I care so much about my fellow students at Turing, and feel like a valuable part of the community I was able to embrace this mod with excitement!  I feel the connections I’ve formed through pairings, SAB and general communication with others have allowed me to make an impact not only in my cohort but in the Turing community as well, just as others have impacted me.
