# Samuel Lim - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I hoped to more clearly grasp OOP concepts and get familiar working in Ruby, especially when working with advanced enumerables. I found this to be very compatible with my previous experience in Python (sans the more complicated enums). I also hoped to become more independant as not only a student of Turing, but as well as an individual who is young and living on their own for the first time. I know my attendance has been an issue, but within the last two weeks of the module I believe I have begun to if not already have set up a systematic lifestyle change that enables me to keep my attendance and participation up-to-par as well as allowing me to become more involved with the community.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

#### Project 1 (William):

**Feedback for William:**

> Overall I think you did an excellent job as a pair. We worked through the various challenges logically and communicated ideas of what we had in mind when it came to pseudocoding. Your biggest strength in the project would definitely be writing our unit/integration tests for our various classes. For some coaching, I'd like to recommend getting more familiar with branching and branch organization. We both had issues with this, and I believe it is something we both need to work on. Other than that I would love and hope to work with you again on future projects!

**Feedback from William:**

> For my most recent project, I was partnered with Sam Lim. I had a great partner project experience and only have positive things to say. If I had to select something for coaching, the only thing I can think of would be Sam having a fast pace on the first day when we were separated, so I had trouble catching up up the next day. This was not an issue however, as we were able to work together and I was able to catch up on what was missed relatively quickly.  All in all, I wouldnâ€™t change a thing and had a perfect first pairing project with Sam.  Thanks!

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset

After this Gear Up session, the weeks following have really introduced and reinforced the ideology of _yet_ and a growth mindset. Being presented with a challenge beyone the scope of my ability has encouraged m to put in more and more effort through means of self discovery/learning to overcome said obstacle.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things

Building a new more healthy, better-sustainable schedule is one thing in particular that I have had difficulty with. Going back to a growth vs fixed mindset, I have applied those concepts to difficulties not only in lifestyle but with conceptualizing various aspects of Ruby as well. Overall I believe it takes patience and work ethic to become better at difficult things.

#### Session 3: Introvert vs. Extrovert

I have been succesful (at least in my opinion) in maintaining a growth mindset in terms of building relationships with my peers. Being so much younger presents quite the challenge, a social onstacle. But with a growth mindset it has allowed me to overcome that. It is very important to be communicating clearly and openly to an extrovert (me being an introvert). Often times we introverts can come across as "stand-offish", and a big part of succesfully dealing with this spectrum is being aware of that. Where I place myself on the Introvert/Extrovert spectrum (I'd consider myself an ambivert leaning towards introversion), is perfect for carreer development. Once I'm comftorable and confident my introversion morphs into extroversion; sure it may be tiring, but that's how we derive and lose energy in social situations. My spot on the spectrum allows for not only good communication with all sorts of varying intro/extroversion, but also allows comfort in working alone in solace.

#### Session 4: Strengths & Storytelling

The largest takeaway I have from rereading my themes has to do with the Intellection theme and it's relation to the Introvert/Extrovert spectrum we learned about. I think this combined with my theme of Ideation really help to explain why I fall where I do on the spectrum. My mind is always processing, thinking, and in order to better communicate I have to learn to better express those abstract thoughts. I know an immense amount more about OOP and how networking and such is essential to finding a job in the industry. I think my fascination with programming is even stronger now than when it was at Day 1 because I can visualize what more experience and learning will do to expanding my potential. I want people to see me as a more invested reliable peer in the Turing culture. I know my attendance has been less-than adequete thus far but I really have faith that I can turn that around. It's all about learning to become independant as this is my first time on my own. Themes of ideation and competition come into play when describing how I proved to myself that I could be a developer; the Intel Science/Engineering Fair I participated in last year, as a mere high schooler, with a project written in python complete with a backend and frontend that I won first place in Comp Sci/Engineering with.

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap

It is absolutely incredible to me how the gender gap has risen so much over the past 30-40 years. Nowadays women in the industry experience all kinds of discrimation, sexism, objectification, and so on and so forth. Due to my gender I can't _directly_ relate to the issues women experience in this environvment. However after watching that film I've realized in hindsight how many times i"ve witnessed a woman being uncomftorable and isolated due to the problem at hand. A big part of this is _realizing_ there's an issue and actually stepping in to advocate! Perspective is absolute key here when gender disparity comes into play. Due to my age and coming to Turing right out of High School, I can somewhat relate to how gender disparity can affect women poorly. As with them, I am also a minority, but in age not gender. I have been working hard on bridging that gap to create meaningful relationships with my older peers, and now I finally have begin to see myself not as a high schooler interested in programming, but a _Turing Student_.

### Community Participation

This mod I was not very comftorable networking with people outside of my cohort. A large part of this was due to the self-concsciousness I experienced due to my young age. However I have big plans for next mod (which I hope to advance to) such as starting a cybersecurity posse and perhaps leading some spikes on network security and threat assesment.
