# YOHANAN ASSEFA - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this module was to develop strong foundations in Ruby, improve my problem solving skills, and ability to think logically. I still have a lot of room to grow in all of these aspects, but I have certainly been able to stretch myself and grow over the past six weeks.

### Pair Feedback

#### Project 1 (Enigma):

**Feedback for Squee Muller:**

> Squee, thank you for being a great pair on the Enigma project. From the very beginning you helped to foster a collaborative and enjoyable environment. You are really good at logical thinking, breaking problems down to small manageable pieces, and putting in the required effort and time to finish a project. These skills, combined with your positive energy and kindness towards others, will undoubtedly make you a great software developer/teacher. I think we both agree that we missed an opportunity to learn more about how to use git during this project, as we didn't want to spend too much time trying to figure out our many git issues. Though we found workarounds for git, I think we both recognize that git is a tool we need to learn to use more effectively. Other than that, I think our personalities complimented one another and we both made valuable contributions to the project. Thanks again for being a joy to work with.

**Feedback from Squee Muller:**

> Yohanan, you were absolutely fantastic to work with. I really appreciated so many aspects of working with you. First, when I was having problems thinking through what belonged in our code, you started by just giving me the answers or pointing out where I was going wrong. I asked you if you could give me a minute to think things through before telling me the solution. You actually looked like you got excited that I wanted a challenge and that I didn't want to rely on you to get the work done. I know we could have done some things faster if you'd just given me the solution, but it was important for me to get some of those processes hardwired into my brain without help. Thank you. There was also your compassion around my need for breaks. It is really important for my brain to take breaks. Every time my brain started to get sluggish, I would ask you for a break. Every time, you would agree without hesitation. It made me feel safe in telling you when I was struggling and when I needed to buckle down and focus. Thank you for understanding my needs in that. Also, you are so great at asking for help. I tend to buckle down and want to try everything I can think of before I ask for help. I want to work for the solution myself. You were great at recognizing when that was getting us nowhere and seeking out additional support that could get us back on track. It made us move much faster and dramatically decreased the amount of frustration we both ended up experiencing with the project. I was also so grateful for your motivation to find solutions to questions we had about our project. I would get so caught up in finding a solution to problems that I discounted how important it was to learn more about the side things. The fact that you sought out how to build Modules and included them in our project was a saving grace. It not only improved our score on our project, but it filled me with so much happy to see such a cool tool! That turned into a major motivator for me to ask more questions of our other classmates to see what else I could learn. Thank you for setting such an awesome example in engaging with your curiosity for curiosity sake. That was beautiful. The only thing I can think of that might have made you a stronger partner for me to work with would be holding me accountable to the things that I can find work arounds for. Git was a struggle for us. We both just wanted to give up on git and get the project done. But I think that part of that lesson was about getting us to figure out a git workflow. We missed that lesson when we just got frustrated with git. I think if one or both of us had been more insistent that we needed to figure out git and solve our problems with it, we would have gotten much more out of that lesson. But even in that, I was so appreciative of your patience and cool-headedness. That was so enormously frustrating! All in all, working with you was a fantastic experience. I appreciated your patience, chill nature, experience, and enthusiasm. You brought so much to the team, and I know that you will continue to contribute enormously to your future teams as well.

#### Project 2 (Headcount):

**Feedback for Chantal Justamond:**

> Chantal, I want to thank you for being a genuine teammate under a very difficult and stressful situation. This was a challenging project for both of us. But not once did we take out our frustrations on each other or act in a manner that made the other person feel like we weren't in this together. I really felt like we bonded meaningfully throughout this experience and learned a lot about git, manipulating information from a csv file, and accessing information from a database. Though it would have been wonderful if we had gotten to iteration 5, I'm commending our persistence in making sure that we had solid foundations for our code at the very beginning. We also did a good job of pulling together our resources and we learned a lot through this process. I very much appreciate your patience, grit, easy going nature, and consistent use of pry during our project. Thank you so much for being a wonderful teammate!   

**Feedback from Chantal Justamond:**

> I honestly don't have any constructive feedback!  I know we are supposed to give suggestions on how we could improve but I can't think of a single area where you could have given more, you're effort was outstanding.  I think we were good about switching roles, picking up each other's slack when we were brain-dead & dividing and conquering. We never surrendered to Head Count, even when we had to refactor iteration zero 3 times. Frustration never got the best of us, we kept fighting it and winning.  I would like to add It was a real pleasure working with you!  The fact that you were so willing to put every last minute of your free time into this project was highly motivating.

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset

I am much more appreciative of the progress that I have made thus far and I feel more confident in myself. The initial doubts that I had about whether I will be a good developer are no longer as strong. Most days, I believe that with time and consistent effort, I will become a good developer. But there are also times when I feel discouraged and disappointed in myself for not grasping things as fast as I would like, or expect. Perhaps these are moments I should try and be more empathetic towards myself and try to adapt a "not yet" mindset.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things

I have accepted that being at Turing and learning to code is not an easy process. This has helped reduce my frustrations with the pace that I am grasping what is being taught and it helps me to not waste my cognitive energy by wanting this experience to be a breeze. My effort at getting good at difficult things has included making time to do drills and a range of Ruby exercises. I also try to cherish moments where concepts and drills that were once really difficult become more manageable. Pushing aside my fears and focusing on how to become a good developer has been conducive to my learning.

#### Session 3: Introvert vs. Extrovert

Open and respectful communication about our temperaments is very important when working with others. People draw their energies differently and their ability to do their best work can be impacted by the type of stimulation they are surrounded. We need to do our best to understand each other's personality traits and be empathetic to the other person's needs.

#### Session 4: Strengths & Storytelling

I came to Turing because I wanted to develop new skills and use them to make positive contributions in the world. I feel fortunate to have the capacity to be here and I am growing and learning every day. Compared to my first weeks at Turing, I am much better at managing stress and not doubting my capacity to learn and understand difficult concepts. I am much more on top of things and have faith that I can succeed at Turing and beyond as long as I continue to work hard and make use of all the community resources that help to reinforce what we learn in class.

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap

It is very disappointing that the tech industry has a significant lack of gender diversity and that there is widespread discrimination and bias towards women. Many of us are choosing to enter this industry because we expect it to bring positive change in our lives. It is unfortunate that once we enter the job market, many of us will face bias and unfounded questions regarding our skills. But it is encouraging to see that Turing is doing a good job at addressing this problem and has committed itself to having a diverse student body. The school still has some ways to go, especially with regards to racial diversity, but I believe that its efforts are in the right direction. I also think that the Joan Clarke Society provides women at Turing an important space where we can lean on each other and have a support system.

### Community Participation

This module felt less stressful than the last one. This helped me to interact more with my cohort and I felt much more connected with the Turing community.
