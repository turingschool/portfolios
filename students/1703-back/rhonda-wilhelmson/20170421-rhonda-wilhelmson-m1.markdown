# RHONDA WILHELMSON - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For module 1, I aspire to obtain a solid understanding of Ruby fundamentals in order to supplement my professional skills and experience. In addition to technical knowledge, I also would like to further develop my strengths, assess my weaknesses, enable self-awareness and improve my communication skills.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

#### Project 1 (Partner Name):

**Feedback for Marc Fidelman:**

> I am grateful that Marc was very conscious and self-aware during the entirety of our project. Every step of the way, Marc made sure to check in with me regarding my feelings and understanding of the project and his role in those feelings. I think our main issue with the project came from developing an effective time table and thorough planning that we could stick to throughout the course of our coding process. I believe that this was overlooked and/or put on the back burner in the beginning by both of us and never revisited. That isn’t exactly a critique of Marc individually as I think that was a shared responsibility. I enjoyed working with Marc and tackling my first paired project. We definitely should have at least tried to break down the project into a schedule of what we wanted to accomplish every day and we also shouldn’t have let ourselves get stuck on a minor issue with the coding for such a long period of time that other aspects of the project were overlooked.


**Feedback from Marc Fidelman:**

> Rhonda, I had a great time working on the Enigma project with you. There are a lot of areas where I felt we were a good balance for each other. I think the way we defined our working relationship and made a point of being up front about weaknesses we were aware of helped us support each other effectively. You really helped keep me from getting us into rabbit holes. I think the strongest suggestion I have is to front load the time put into a project and stick to a real pomodoro schedule. We both have that urge to plow through to a goal but it’s important to recognize that effort spent with a tired brain is often poor quality. I hope you keep up with experimenting in the console and using pry to affirm ruby behavior, it goes a long way to avoiding keyboard paralysis. I’m not going to forget running our first crack anytime soon, I’m glad I got there with you: “not so secret anymore ..end..” -Marc

#### Project 2 (Partner Name):

**Feedback for Nick Edwards:**

Nick has been a thoughtful, brilliant and focused partner throughout the entirety of our project. Nick’s Ruby skills and ability to parse through the hefty amounts of data to make complex calculations really motivated me and educated me as we worked together. Nick made sure to talk me through his portions of the code and allowed me to drive for the majority of the project. He’s super open to any contributions and questions I had regarding our work throughout the iterations. I encourage Nick to continue building his stamina for partner collaborations and keep up the great communication. I learned a lot by partnering with Nick and I am also grateful for his encouragement of taking meaningful breaks as I have a problem with working non-stop without regard for necessary intermissions. Thanks, Nick!

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset

To really benefit from a growth mindset at Turing, I need to first welcome challenges and truly believe that I should be at Turing. It's important for me to view challenges as a good thing. I also need to place my focus on 100% deliberate effort and the journey itself rather than the daunting nature of the destination. I am triggered by feeling confused, comparing myself to others who I perceive as doing better than me and feeling like I have to be the absolute best at everything I do in life. It's more important for me to help others, collaborate with more experienced and knowledgeable students and keep the lines of communication open.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things

In order to get better at difficult things, it's crucial to develop an effective learning method. It is helpful to take one subject at a time and divide it into areas of specificity. I need to instill a method of learning that utilizes high-quality, super high-quantity examples. At the moment, it feels like there simply aren't enough specific resources or even time to review these resources, but I am making a concerted effort to turn my learning process towards that direction. Whenever I feel hopeless, I lose my focus which, in turn, negatively impacts my ability to learn.

#### Session 3: Working Styles

Being on the more introverted end of the introvert/extrovert spectrum has no impact on my working style. I know that I can function independently just as efficiently as I can function working with a partner or group. It definitely helps for me to have a specific task. I can also lead a group as I have a personal strength that involves identifying the individual strengths of group members and assigning them applicable jobs that will benefit the project as a whole. I never before thought about the ability of others to function better in a group if their introverted/extroverted is taken into account. That opened up some opportunities and challenges to me.

#### Session 4: Strengths & Storytelling

I decided to attend Turing because I compared it to other options and it always took the lead in regards to fulfilling my desire to transition from the broadcast entertainment industry into software. I view the world more as an outsider who possesses a certain consciousness about how the world really works, but who also can't seem to shake societal conditioning. I struggle to abandon all senses of identity while also trying to find my place. I'm driven by my values to maintain my integrity and cultivate relationships that are meaningful. I also heavily value mental and physical health. I put my utmost effort and intensity into nurturing my relationships and achieving my goals.

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap

My experience at Turing thus far has been different than the unfortunate experiences shared in the documentary. At Turing, I don't feel excluded or "less than" because of my gender. I haven't experienced any kind of harassment nor have I been discouraged from pursuing a career in software engineering. I think I likely represent minority groups and I interact in a way that is welcoming and inclusive of everyone regardless of their background or identity and it feels like everyone is given an opportunity here. I haven't yet personally or via others witnessed anything similar to the experiences shared in the documentary here at Turing.

### Community Participation

Throughout my time at Turing, I openly and enthusiastically participated in several community events such as demo nights, weekly guest speakers, weekly gear ups, the SAB mixer, additional weekend/evening "classes", mentor pairing, pairing with upper mod students, pairing with Turing alumni and extracurricular outings with my cohort.
