# Nick Edwards - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I aimed to learn how to build and consume APIs, and I think that I achieved this goal and I still have much more to learn. More importantly, I got experience in working independently and on teams to solve problems I had never seen before. This was the hardest part for me of Mod 3: the need to approach new problems on the fly and quickly adapt instead of just memorizing patterns.

## Group Work & Projects

**[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
  * Rales Engine is a RESTful API that sends business intelligence and resource data.
  * Building this API was good practice for learning how APIs work. I also found it to be good experience in working with a partner who has a different communication style than I do.

**[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
**[Trail-Up](https://trail-up.herokuapp.com/)**
  * Trail-Up allows users to browse from thousands of trails across North America and create hiking events, and connect with other outdoor enthusiasts.
  * This project was a great experience in working on a 5-person team. It was my first time implementing JavaScript, which was a challenge and a good learning experience.

**Cloney Island Sprint 2**
  * This is a Kickstarter clone. We used a brownfield codebase and implemented new features and other changes that enhance the user experience. Users can create a project, browse other projects, and they can back a project. The user can browse projects by categories, and from there can filter the categories by specific parameters. We included business intelligence from our custom API looking at statistics such as locations hosting the most projects. This project uses two factor authentication with Twilio when a user logs in. When the user is updating a location for a project they create the fields are autofilled with geolocate from the google places API.
  * This project taught me about the difficulties involved in working on existing codebases. It has offered me more perspective on how to write code that is readable and maintainable by others, and also perspective on being more forgiving about the code other people have written.

## **Gear Ups**

[MicroAgressions](https://gist.github.com/nickedwards109/24a1aab0739cd158474e250f8aeddd69)
We talked a lot about the need to be cognizant of microagressions and the need to speak up when you observe them. The appropriate way to speak up depends on the context, so it may be best to speak up immediately or possibly to speak to the offender in private later. In any case, calling it out when you observe a microagression can go a long way towards preventing this type of behavior in the future.

[Allyship](https://gist.github.com/nickedwards109/c529d7e37304770d3df115d13c035218)
In this gear up, our discussion group focused on a scenario where a student says that all the talk about gay pride is a distraction to what we are all trying to do here at Turing. We talked about the responsibility to point out to the student that this is not about YOU. It is about people who are marginalized in our society and it it not up to you to decide how they can express themselves. If nobody said anything in response to this student, it would reinforce the person's misperception that it is acceptable to disparage marginalized peoples' expression of themselves. It is our responsibility to speak up.

[Coding Schools or Coding Fools](https://gist.github.com/nickedwards109/7852c8abfd007790e03dca6c7ffc1d16)
The technical education industry is evolving rapidly. On one hand, the job market is becoming well-suited for practical skills rather than abstract theory. At the same time, a lot of bootcamps have emerged that are saturating the job market with junior developers. Turing is special because of its non-profit status, which allows the organization to focus on education instead of maximizing profitability. We observed that Turing grads are generally more prepared than grads from other bootcamps.

## Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
  * During this mod, I was very proactive about pairing with colleagues in situations where I had more knowledge or experience than them in a certain area. In particular, I helped a few colleagues get started with implementing JavaScript. This was worth the time because we both leveled up based on the discussions we had.

#### **Posse**
  * Our posse ended up having a lot of loose discussions about similarities and differences between Ruby and JavaScript. I learned a little bit about JavaScript from these discussions, and some of the front-end people in the posse learned a little bit about Ruby.
  * We are planning on being more organized next mod by spending our time actually doing CodeWars challenges in Ruby and JavaScript together, which will hopefully provide more structure and help people learn more from each other.

#### **Playing a Part**
  * I played a little bit of music for the school as a "lightning concert", which was fun!
