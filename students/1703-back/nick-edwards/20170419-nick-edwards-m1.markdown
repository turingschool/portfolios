### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

#### Project 1 (Partner Name):

**Feedback for Charlie Corrigan:**

Charlie-
I thoroughly enjoyed working with you on Enigma. I thought that your efficient use of time was a great asset to our team, which helped us move forward as a team when I was moving slowly. I would add that you might work even more successfully if you stick more diligently to a TDD workflow of iterating red => green => refactor, instead of several iterations of red => green followed by one big refactoring attempt. This approach might seem slower initially, but with practice it should ultimately make it easier to understand and modify your code in the future, and it often makes the development process take less time overall. Thank you for being a great team partner, and I look forward to continuing to collaborate on refactoring Enigma in the future!

**Feedback from Charlie Corrigan:**

Nick, thank you so much for being such a great partner on this project. You demonstrated a lot of skill in TDD and in your methodical, careful approach to articulating code. I think those qualities really show through in our project’s fabulous testing stats and in the general level of organization present in our program. I also thought you were really open to talking through points we didn’t initially agree on and helping us reach a good consensus. I think both of us have had such a great opportunity to learn and practice compromising between your more careful way of writing of really well-thought out code and my more goal and deadline oriented approach to writing code. I know you plan to stay conscious of time management and deadlines as much as I plan to be more intentional and disciplined in my testing and refactoring. I’m glad to have gotten to work on this project with you and hope we get to work together again. Thanks for helping to make this a great experience.

#### Project 2 (Partner Name):

**Feedback for Rhonda Wilhelmson:**

Rhonda-
Thank you for collaborating with me on Headcount. You bring a very positive attitude to the table, which was helpful for moving forward when we were tired and stressed. I think that your attitude and demeanor helped us push through a lot of really challenging work. I would add that you might be able to work through data processing tasks more quickly by spending more time using pry to examine the results of your code as you go. Even though this takes a little bit more time immediately, it often helps avoid confusing bugs in the future, which ultimately saves time and makes development go more smoothly. I'm happy that I got the chance to work with you, and I hope that we get to work together again!

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset
**How have your experiences this week put you into a growth or fixed mindset?**
I had to change my mindset into a growth mindset in order to implement sorting algorithms for the first time. I had a lot of difficulty getting the algorithms working at first, but instead of viewing that status as fixed, I chose to believe that I could grow past my current status. Eventually, I was able to implement the sorting algorithms, and I have grown into a more experienced and knowledgeable developer.

**What do you believe can cause a person to get stuck in a fixed mindset?**
Often, societal messages can contribute to a problematic fixed mindset. When we hear language saying that someone is "smart" or "dumb", it creates a false notion that ability is fixed.

**What strategies can you use to move into and stay in a growth mindset?**
It is important to continuously reflect on the truth that ability is not fixed. By consciously acknowledging that ability can change with concerted effort, we can promote a growth mindset within ourselves that can hopefully inspire people around us to grow as well.

**What supports can you ask for from peers and instructors to support a growth mindset?**
I feel that I can openly communicate with peers and instructors in order to check myself if I get stuck in a fixed mindset. By communicating with people who are or have been in similar situations, I can remind myself and remind others that ability can grow with time and effort.


#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things
I thought that this GearUp session was very helpful for showing me how to be more systematic in my approach to learning. In particular, I am drawn to the notion of three categories of ability (A: things you can't do but need to, B: things you can do with effort, and C: things you can do effortlessly). Personally, I need to work more on moving abilities from B to C in order to gain true mastery of my tools. This focus takes away time from moving things out of A, but I accept that tradeoff for now because my backlog of abilities in B is already substantial. Through deep practice, I can gain the ability to implement my abilities with minimal effort, which will free up time for moving another skill through the pipeline from A to B to mastery at C.


#### Session 3: Introvert vs. Extrovert
This session was very helpful for promoting a perspective of respect for people who have a different working style than you. Personally, I am somewhere on the middle of the spectrum, so I would consider myself an ambivert. I view this as a strength in contexts where I can be a facilitator in a team that consists of both introverts and extroverts. I need to be mindful of the impact my actions might have on other team members, especially since my extroverted aspect might be overwhelming to introverts and my introverted aspect might seem non-communicative to extroverts. By being empathetic and mindful, it is possible to collaborate synergistically with people who have a different working style.


#### Session 4: Strengths & Storytelling
**Look at your initial StrengthsFinder reflection that you completed in week 1 -- how have your perceptions of the top 5 themes changed?**
- I now perceive that the Learner strength is particularly important, because in nobody in Software Engineering is ever finished learning. I am trying to build on this strength in my own time at Turing, and I am also trying more actively to help people learn if they need help.
- As for the Input strength, my perception of it has not changed during my time here. I still think it is important to provide input wherever it is valuable, while also stopping to think beforehand whether that input is relevant or whether its impact could be different from the intent.
- I am starting to feel that the Belief strength can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it is good to believe strongly in best practices in Software Engineering, and implement those good practices continuously. However, it could be problematic to stick to a certain belief that is actually wrong or irrelevant in a different context. So, I think it is important to recognize that beliefs should be updated as knowledge grows, and beliefs should be constantly re-evaluated depending on the context of the problem your team is working on.
- As for Connectedness, my perception of it has not changed during my time here. I still think that it is relevant to remain connected to the outside world, even when deep in the rabbit hole of Software Engineering. By maintaining a sense of connection to the world and society at large, it seems possible to focus more while at work. Since there is an understanding that you are still a part of something greater, it becomes less problematic to spend lots of time working out minute details as is necessary for Software Engineers.
- My appreciation for the Restorative strength has greatly increased during my time here. I have found that it is very important in stressful situations to periodically take the time to restore one's energy and make sure that the team's needs are also met. This can help a team continue to make steadfast progress when faced with a large and difficult workload.

**How are you different today than when you first started at Turing? Where are you stronger now than on day 1?**
I think I am a little bit stronger on the Input strength, because I have had more chances to provide input to others, which has forced me to think about how I frame input in different situations. I also think that my Learner strength is evolving, since I approach learning in a more systematic way now than how I used to. Most importantly, I have become a much more empathetic collaborator. I think that my skills in working with other people has greatly increased, and I now strive to continue to develop those skills.

**Considering how you describe these themes, how do you want others to see you as you continue to progress through Turing?**
I want others to see me as someone who is a good collaborator. I want others to understand that I am a good team player who can work well with people who are different from me.

**How might these themes play a role in describing your Turing story?**
These themes are important in describing my Turing story because they will hopefully show that during my time here, I have grown and become a more experienced collaborator.

**Even though your Turing story isn't finished yet, what do you envision for your development in future mods? How will this story end?**
I hope that my own growth will continue and I hope the same for everybody else. In particular, I envision becoming more experienced with pairing and teamwork in the context of software development. I think that this growth will make me a valuable professional candidate, and I hope that my excitement about collaboration inspires those around me as well. This story will end with every graduate getting a job in the software industry!


#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap
This was a very eye-opening session for me. I learned a lot about how gender discrimination is problematically a norm in tech, and how we need to take an active role in fighting this discrimination. I learned that I need to practice active listening more, so that I can better understand the perspectives of people who are discriminated against. I agree with the notion that ability in Software Engineering is learned through growth, not inherited as a fixed quantity. So, in order to bring the best set of talent into the field, we need to promote inclusivity and growth for everyone (and especially under-represented demographics) so that all the collective potential in the industry can be realized. Finally, I learned that I need to take a more active role in standing up against discrimination and speaking out when I see it. My individual efforts will hopefully inspire others as well to promote inclusivity and fight against prejudice.


### Community Participation
I have tried to be a resource for students who need help. This has mostly taken the form of responding to specific requests for help, although I have also occasionally actively reached out to the group saying that I am available to help on a particular topic. I hope to reach out more actively during future mods.
