# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

I was most excited to learn Javascript during Mod4, both because it's a language that I've wanted to learn since I saw what it could accomplish on the client side experience, and also because I was excited to know what the experience of learning a new language would be _after_ learning to program in Ruby.

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

My biggest technical challenge this mod was in creating my capstone in Javascript. I basically googled everything.


* What did you like the most about the challenge?

It has given me a lot of confidence in my ability to figure out new challenges on my own.


* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

Again, I basically googled everything. I read docs, I read tutorials, in some cases I installed, played with, and then discarded many options before figuring out what worked.


* What did you learn?

I learned some good strategies for working with a new language. I learned to be a bit more comfortable in Express.


## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  - Migrations and queries with Knex (especially in accessing data from promises)
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  - Aaron and I did a lot of Googling, a lot of trial and error, and when all else failed, asked an instructor or a peer for some direction
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
 - There were a lot of similarities to migrations and queries in Rails once I got started, they just weren't immediately apparent and it was tough to figure out the approprate approach for Express/Knex at times. A good example is dependent destroy/cascade delete
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  - Webpack/npm build/bundle.js
  - Routes with Express
  - PSQL Database interaction with Knex
* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
  - Start with better organization on the backend next time instead of retrofitting. Or, at the very least, refactor into organization more frequently instead of at the end. We didn't learn how to organize an Express app until the last day or two of the project, but once we were able to organize into controllers and models, the concepts we were learning were really clarified for me.
* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
  - Wonderful! I like getting to put two brains towards a new problem. Also, my partner was a fantastic organizer of code and I felt like his organizational skills really helped our project to be a success.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

My biggest individual technical challenge in this project was authentication and authorization in Javascript.


* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

At first I sought the good advice of my peers and instructors, but when I wasn't able to find answers, I relied pretty much entirely on the internet.


* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I feel like this particular challenge gave me the confidence I still needed to move forward from Turing and take on new challenges in a not-school environment.


* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

1. Advanced Googling
2. Passport authentication with Dropbox Oauth2 authorization
3. Designing and completing a project without TDD


## Feedback

Once again, I think that my most meaningful feedback this mod was from Schutte. When I was getting really frustrated with Javascript authentication/authorization in my capstone and was getting a bit desperate for help, Schutte sat down with me. While he was able to help me with a deployment issue I happened to get snagged on right before our pairing, he didn't help me with my larger project problems. After I explained the level of my confusion and despair, he told me, "You _do_ understand that I can't help you with all of that, right?" Everyone always says that while Turing teaches students how to program, more importantly Turing teaches students how to _learn_ to program. And, having the confidence to do that is the thing I've struggled with most. I'm pretty grateful (after the fact), to have been given a strong final reminder that I can and should be able to learn whatever comes next on my own. And, I'm really grateful for the experience of having actually pushed through on my own after that.

## Gear Up

I enjoyed planning the GearUp on AI. It was my first opportunity to lead a class since I left my position at the library. It was a lot of fun to organize and I really enjoyed getting to discuss the tech of the future with other cohorts.

## Community Involvement

Most of my community involvement this inning was in helping Mod1 and Mod2 students with projects and in trying to foster supportive relationships with other 1703 folks, FE and BE. I also continued to help organize a couple of industry tours for my classmates to try to encourage more networking and more camaraderie in the job hunt.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

- Programming
- Learning new things in programming
- Communication and collaboration
