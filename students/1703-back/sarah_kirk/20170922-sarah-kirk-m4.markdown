# Sarah Kirk 1703-BE Module 4

## Area of Emphasis

My area of emphasis this inning was to actively search for jobs and network before graduation. I don't have as many options as other students so it was important for me to keep my eye on the prize. I was able to meet and speak with a lot of people in the area that I want to live in, and I think one of those people could become a good friend of mine. I realized the importance of making connections on a personal level, something that I had taken for granted in the past. I not only want a job that fulfills my financial goals, but my personal goals as well. Because of the connections I have made I believe that it is possible.

## Assessment

Outcome: Fail

For the JavaScript assessment I just simply was not ready. I was dealing with personal matters all throughout the Quantified Self project which hindered my learning. I was proud to have come a long way from where I had first started, but it wasn't up to Turing standard. I enjoyed that the challenge was able to make me think about how I would manipulate the DOM to make what I wanted happen. I learned that I perform a lot better when I do not feel stressed about the situation of a test. It is helpful for me to try and remove myself from the panic mindset of test taking - something that has afflicted me since childhood. I was offered an opportunity to redeem myself with my capstone project.

## Quantified Self

My biggest challenge with Quantified Self was being thrown in to a JavaScript project immediately with little to no preparation. I did my best to buckle down, look at examples or tutorials, and ask my partner for help when I needed it. It was really cool seeing how the front end worked however, it made me think about how I might refactor some former projects to include a more reactive site. I learned a lot about building an API in express, JavaScript, and JQuery. I was particularly excited about event listeners and having things happen when I interacted with a page. If I had to change one thing about my technical approach it would be to take a deep dive into learning and understanding JavaScript. I would have been more helpful for me to see what was going where, and taking advantage of the debugging tools. Working with a partner to learn something like JavaScript was interesting. We were both in the same boat and started the app out together, building the foundations, and then separating when we knew a bit more. 

## Capstone Project

My biggest technical challenge was working with the Google cloud SDK, AWS bucket, and Heroku trying to make the three get along. Because a couple of those were such unfamiliar concepts, I had to dive heavily into the docs just to get an understanding so that I might get started. I looked at a lot of tutorials, found similar implementations on stack overflow, and made decisions to come back to problems when I was too tired or frustrated to continue. I really enjoyed being able to combine my prior and current disciplines into one thing. It was a lot of fun to see how my knowledge about geology compared to that of a machine. Turns out, I still have the advantage. I learned a lot of new concepts in this project, namely working with the Google Vision API. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before. I challenged myself with making a separate front end and back end, front end with Javascript, and the backend with Rails. I also learned about accessing and storing photos with AWS photobucket so that my app could rely on the photos stored through my backend framework.  

## Feedback

During Jeff's session on technical interview prep he said that the three key components to landing a job were discipline, hustle, and skill. This struck a chord with me. I knew that if I didn't have the skill a company wanted I could just move on to the next company because I would have already had things going on aside from that one prospect. From my job hunt so far it has proven true that the more I reach out the more I hear back. I have been getting better and better at cold outreach and structuring cover letters and thank you emails. I believe that this practice benefits me in the long run and that I will be able to find a position that I lover relatively quickly.   

## Gear Up

It was very fun to write a Gear-Up on a subject that I am passionate about. I saw JK Rowling's speech on "The Fringe Benefits of Failure" and it resonated with me so I wanted to share her knowledge. I think it is important for Turing students and really everyone to understand that from failure there is also growth. I think it is important that we start to change the narrative about failure in our culture from an entirely negative thing, but rather a reflection on what can be learned from those situations.

## Community Involvement

We started something that we called "Interview Posse" where we got together after class and practiced interview questions with one another. It is helpful to hear how someone else would answer that question, and also forces you to see where your own understanding may be lacking. From this, I put together a google doc shared with the members of interview posse. This was an editable doc where we could put questions that stumped us up, reiteration of information that we learned, and helpful charts to understand some more technical concepts.

I also wanted to keep the Girl Squad channel open from Mod 3. It was very nice working with such incredible women that wanted to help one another out. I think it is important to stand together with other people that are under represented in the tech world to support, congratulate, and give advice to.

## Going Forward

I am going to make sure that my needs are met in terms of recharge and self care. I learned this lesson the hard way, but sometimes those are the lessons that last. I will take my git workflow into every job that I do from now on. It has proven extremely helpful to have clear and concise commit messages with descriptive pull requests. The last thing that I will be keeping in mind moving forward is my ability to learn something entirely independently. Even though it may not be as fast as working with someone else, if I put the time and the effort in I am able to understand a concept that was new to me. My capstone, if anything, taught me this.
