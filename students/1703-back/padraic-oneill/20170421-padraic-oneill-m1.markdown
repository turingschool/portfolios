# PADRAIC O'NEILL - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

It was clear from the start how intense the Turing program would be. I tried my best to maintain a forward progression, while consistently trying to strengthen the foundations of my skills. I focused on OO programming principles and developing good practices, step by step. I became comfortable with creating Modules, Classes, and methods, and am continuing to develop a knack for sending objects back and forth. TDD has also been a primary focus point, and the more I used it the more value I gain from it. Alongside coding, I also made time for self-reflection to question my habits and call out my preconceived notions or judgements of other people. This is the first learning environment where I feel age isn't a factor in my ability to interact with other students.

### Pair Feedback

#### Project 1 (Adam Gunther):

**Feedback for Adam Gunther:**

I’m grateful to have had my first pairing project with you. I felt like we were often on the same level as far as experience and skills, but more importantly in terms of our dispositions and ability to communicate. These factors made the experience smooth and productive. There were times when I became frustrated with the code and its unwillingness to do what we wanted, and I could tell that you picked up on that. Part of that frustration was that we were running out of time. In retrospect, I would have preferred if we’d worked on Sunday, but I followed your lead and agreed to take Sunday off. We probably would have made a lot progress ton that day and that may have resulted in us finishing the project before the wee hours of the morning. I’d suggest trying to use the weekends to be as productive as possible since there is less pressure, and it’s usually the beginning of the project. Instead of sharing in my frustration you were able to forge ahead and get us to the next level, when we then could share a little victory. Your fortitude was a big part of our success as a team.

**Feedback from Adam Gunther:**

Overall, the pairing went smoothly. We took on the driver/navigator role which worked well, because we found ourselves to be at the same level of skill and found it was helpful for us to articulate our thought process to each other. It was easy to get along with each other, even during struggles. It was a nice way to relieve fatigue to switch from figuring out how it should be coded to/from how it should be approached. We were each aware we had a lot to learn to get the project completed, but welcomed the challenge positively, and certainly learned a lot. Upon retro, we were very much on the same page as far as problems/opportunities for improvement.  We failed to adhere to the rubric/scaffolding which caused lots of refactoring down the road, which made us lose sight of the full scope of the project. We did not sketch/diagram/pseudocode or discuss our overall approach once we started and began to abandon TDD when it became crunch time. Moving forward, it's clear a working program needs to be done two days before the due date to save a day for refactoring. The pairing was worthwhile, each member did their part, and when the struggle was real, each of us came through with creative solutions.

#### Project 2 (Partner Name):

**Feedback for Joel Lindow:**
Joel,

Holy cow, did we endure a lot during this project! Between you and a wicked fever, and me and heavy things unrelated to Turing, we really seemed to hit our limits. I wish for the both of us that our minds were able to be more present and focused on the project. I think no matter what our circumstances the project would have been challenging, and despite our circumstances, I'm glad in some ways to have experienced it in this way. When shit goes just totally awry, maybe we'll both have a little more fortitude.

In the beginning of the project I was in the mindset of hitting the wall hard, struggling to get past the concepts of an intricate and complex project and you were eager to seek outside help. This turned out to be a recurring theme for us and I think we acknowledged each other's stubborn natures. When you got sick I did look for outside help, and then realized that pressures from outside Turing were really draining me. We both made progress individually at times, together at times, we both learned a lot, and that's what really matters.

I spent a fair amount of time mentoring you during first week of this project. While I am happy to help, I think you'd benefit from really digging into the basics. It's not easy to need to work on foundational Ruby knowledge while taking on a vast project. Regardless of the mod-2 prework, or if you decide to repeat mod-1, getting those foundations down is the single most important thing, in my opinion.

Overall, I cannot be more thankful for you during this project. You sensed something was not okay with me, and when I finally told you what was happening, you were immediately there to support me. As it turns out, I didn't need a stellar project, I needed a spectacular project partner. And I got one.

**Feedback from Joel Lindow:**

I've really enjoyed getting to know you better while we've worked on this project. I've spent more time with you in person or online than I've spent with my own family and now it feels like you're almost a cousin or a long lost brother. I'm always impressed by your knowledge. When you or I hit a dead end it seems we can find eachother a "way out" and a place to continue on. I think, given the crazy circumstances we both encountered during this project, that we still complemented eachother's working and learning styles better than could have been expected. I would encourage you to keep pursuing refinement of test driven development. You're doing great work and I think that even better tests will push you far ahead of the pack in your abilities. Thanks for all of your hard work, patience and inspiration. It's been a fruitful experience. Keep up the great work.

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset

This week I've struggled to write code to complete each exercise. The process has helped me identify some weaknesses in my abilities and now I am excited to spend weekend improving those areas.

In the past, I've experienced great amounts of stress, or problems with self-confidence that have made it easy to give up on the challenges I've faced. I know I did it - gave up. But now I feel energized to learn new things and push my boundaries.

My triggers are stress and a lack of self-esteem. These will cause me to tuck tail and run or escape temporarily using methods that are ultimately detrimental to my future growth. My peers can check-in, make sure I'm doing the work on me. Exercise and eating healthy, and sleeping enough are all important factors. Also, my peers can communicate help in a way that is on the level, not be patronizing, and not assume that they know what's best for me.

Now, at the end of the mod, I realize that some of the above came true, and some didn't. The things I thought about myself seemed to remain, although I did push through many boundaries. I adopted more of a work hard, play hard mentality. The things I thought about my peers turned out to be better than ever. We have a strong cohort and I'm lucky to be a part of it.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things

At this point, I'm not really managing, but just going full steam ahead into a very dark abyss. Well, that's how I currently feel about this question in this moment. So, I suppose that this is a challenge. The idea of management seems to be more about breaking things up into small pieces. To section out one's work in, say, farming, is necessary, and arguably a natural human tendency, developed over thousands of years. However, when learning emerging or complex things, it doesn't always come naturally to me to manage the tasks. Section the topic into sub-sections, learn each, and then put them all together.

#### Session 3: Introvert vs. Extrovert

At first I had an issue where'd I feel inadequate when others finished exercises before me. I think I had a fixed mindset. Since, I've focused on developing my skills and asking questions, which has led to good progress and no more worrying about the other people.

My challenge in maintaining a growth mindset has been in empathy. I feel like I default to a me-centric point of view. As an introverted-ambivert, I can act as a good intermediate between the opposite ends of the spectrum. I can perceive the inner frustrations of anyone, well not really, but I mean...some people.

I heard that extroverts need communication because they don't always know when an introvert is needing alone time. This is somewhat crazy to me.

#### Session 4: Strengths & Storytelling

What brought you to Turing?
I'd had enough of the life I'd been living where I try something new and get excited about it mainly because it is/was new. The "new" brings challenges, which is inviting, but in that it's easy to forget about enjoyment of the career.

What lenses or identities do you view the world from most?
Possible ethnicity/culture. I enjoy learning about people's backgrounds and cultures. I think it's important to have a sense of someone's past so that you can have a foundation to building a view of the person's future. I don't think it's necessarily right to ignore ethnic and cultural backgrounds because we are essentially a human community and that includes our entire selves.

What values drive you?
Often, charity and goodwill drive me. I like to help when I can, whether it be a monetary donation or volunteering my time. I get a boost from recognizing I can do things that help other people.

How do I demonstrate those values?
I try to get out into the community and find a good cause and attend to it. I'll typically find a non-profit and volunteer. Also, I'll try to be grateful as society expects, but also take it up a level if I am able.

Could other people identify your values?
I think my friends know of my charity and people new to my life soon learn I'm not out to put anyone down or make jokes at the expense of others.

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap

How are your experiences at Turing similar/different?
The percentage of women in classes at Turing seems well above the norm for the industry. I haven't seen any blatant disregard for women, but I do realize that I may not see what others see.

What role do you play in creating a more inclusive environment?
I try to maintain a laid-back, talk to anyone attitude that I think helps me connect with more people, regardless of gender or color. Our cohort has one or more people representing a range of gender, race, and sexual orientations. It's easy to see that I can in fact, connect with all of these people without really thinking about their race, gender, or sexual orientation.

Brainstorm a specific situation you've witnessed or heard of at Turing that's similar to the movie.
I'd heard about some guys talking out loud, around women, about some inappropriate topics. The girl who related this story was obviously triggered when repeating it for this conversation. I don't think I'd participate in that kind of blatant disregard for the qualities of women. I can imagine what the guys were talking about, and there's something just plain rude about that sort of childish bullshit.

### Community Participation

During my weeks at Turing I've helped a couple of students a lot in their studies. I enjoy the type of mentoring opportunities I've had just as student somewhere near the middle of my cohort's current abilities set. I've attended the Wozniak spike several times and learned a lot about data structures. I've also spent many hours with a professional mentor, Peter Carr, who has helped me on almost all of my individual projects, taking me slowly through the concepts and making sure I find the answer on my own. Step by step, line by line.

I think I've contributed positively to the community at Turing. I have tried to branch out to other mods and students in the other cohort, and have gotten to a friendly basis with many.
