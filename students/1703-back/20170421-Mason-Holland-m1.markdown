### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Enigma (Aaron Olsen): It was quite a pleasure working with Mason. I appreciated his ability to communicate what his limitations were. He laid it all out up front, being cognisant of how those limitations could affect the project, and how he could adjust if it was affecting the project. We agreed at the start on a few sideboards, scheduling conflicts, and what we wanted to achieve by the end. He stuck to those decisions and we had no conflict as a result throughout. Mason was ready to let me take control of the project, such as asking what I wanted him to do, or asking me how we should proceed. This is my main critique for Mason. In the next project, consider taking the lead in steering the direction for a few parts of the project.  You did very well leading when I prompted you. As a result our project benefited from his ideas and effort. The biggest critique is not just for Mason, but for me as well. We met all the basic criteria for the project far ahead of schedule. Rather than ask if there were ways we could further improve what we had, we called it good and moved on. It definitely looks good, and I'm proud of what we made, but we were not critical enough of the project when given the opportunity to be critical. Overall I think Mason has a sharp mind and is great person to work with. While he often downplayed his ability or his contribution, his work gave me no reason to doubt him.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1
**Growth Mindset**

This session was extremely valuable and much needed at the time. I found that I was feeling very overwhelmed and this session helped ground me and teach me a few things about the mindset I needed to adopt to succeed. By the middle of week one I was feeling very stressed and these concepts helped me understand why I was feeling stressed and how to cope with some of those thoughts. 

#### Session 2
**Getting Better at Difficult Things**

This session was equally as valuable and came at the perfect time. I was definitely feeling that I was having a hard time catching on and understanding the concepts. This helped me understand how learning should take place and what skills I could employ to help cultivate my learning. 

#### Session 3
**Strengths & Storytelling**

I enjoyed this session and it allowed me to organise how I thought about my journey and how I would then project or convey that story. I found that I could tell my story in a simkle and concise manner that would allow me to make a good first impression. This session was very valuable. 

#### Session 4
**Debugging the Gender Gap**

Where to begin, I was sceptical of this session going in. However I was very surprised and found the content to be extremely informative and enlightening. It helped alter how I thought about the industry and how I should interact in it and changes I could help implement to create a stronger, more diverse community. I look forward to making a difference in the industry.

### Community Participation
At this point at Turing I wouldn't say I've contributed a great deal to the community. I have attended a few   productivity lunches and have enjoyed and been active in the spikes I have attended. I look forward to doing more pairings next module and being able to help people new programming like I was.
