## Self-Assessment Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module.

| Section | Category | Score |
| - | ----- | - |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 3 |
| B | **Individual Projects** | 3 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 3 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 4 |
| E | **Community** | 4 |

#### Notes

* I believe I still have room to learn a few things. However, considering how sick I was for the last week of class and durring assessments, I believe I did well enough to prove my progress.
* I have 3 children and a 4th child due in about 5 weeks. Despite heavy responsibilities at home I have still put in over 60 hours a week on my education. I have contributed to my community by helping classmates where I can, supporting others who needed friend, creating silly events for the class to participate in together and doing my part to bring people together. I have been truly overwhelmed by my current list of responsibilities but feel I've managed them well considering the load.

------------------------------------------------
## A: End of Module Assessment

| Category | Result (pass, fail, pending) |
| ----- | --- |
| Pairing Assessment | fail |
| Independent Timed Assessment | fail |
| Diagnostic | pending |

* My assessments have all shown that I can easily achieve a 3 in conventional ruby style and a 4 in colaboration. I also have received 4s in mastery of git and GitHub using frequent commits and pull requests.
* The code I write is consistently improving and is of good quality. The fails on my end of module assessments are really only due to time constraints. If given the opportunity to figure something out or find the help I need, I always achieve the goal. Sometimes it just takes a little longer. Keep in mind I've been coding for a total of 7 weeks.
* In the paired assessment I got all 3's, a 4 and a single 2. The 2 was becasue I was 1 or 2 lines short of completing the iteration. Given a little more time I will become quicker and I don't think that this single 2 should constitute a fail.
* I could have easily finished writing all required tests for the "bon_appetit" exercise and achieved a better score. However, I built the tests line by line while following the spec, as to not "write too far ahead". If I'd known that simply writing all the tests up front would have guaranteed a better score, I would have done so.
* I nearly finished iteration 2 of "bon_appetit". You will notice I have commented out an enumerable block I was near completing in the "add_to_shopping_list" method of the pantry.rb file. I believe that some credit should be given for writing the enumerable. I commented it out to allow the rest of the program to run correctly after submission. I didn't want to submit completely failing tests due to 1 bad method, hence commenting it out.


## B: Individual Projects

| CATEGORY | Credit Check | Jungle Beats | Mastermind |
| ----- | - | - | - |
| **Project Spec** | [link](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/credit_check) | [link](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat) | [link](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/mastermind) |
| **Github** | [link](https://github.com/JoelLindow/mod_1_homework/blob/master/credit_check_with_comments_for_reference.rb) | [link](https://github.com/JoelLindow/jungle_beats) | [link](https://github.com/JoelLindow/mastermind) |
| **Functional Expectations** | 3 | 1 | 3 |
| **Test-Driven Development** | X | 3 | 3 |
| **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components** | 1 | 3 | 3 |
| **Fundamental Ruby & Style** | 2 | 2 | 3 |
| **Loop or Recursion** | X | 3 | 3 |

#### Notes
*   I believe my "Credit-Check-Recheck" deserves recognition, as it is a far better representation of my abilities than the original project from week 1. Please see link to my repository:

## C: Group Projects

| CATEGORY | Enigma | Headcount |
| - | - | - |
| **Project Spec** | [link](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma) | [link](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/headcount) |
| **Github** | [link](https://github.com/JoelLindow/Enigma) | [link](http://www.linkedin.com) |
| **Functional Expectations** | 3 | X |
| **Test-Driven Development** | 3 | X |
| **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components** | 2 | X |
| **Fundamental Ruby & Style** | 3 | X |
| **Loop or Recursion** | X | X |
| **Teamwork** | X | X |

#### Notes

* In the project "Enigma" I believe the evaluators comments should be recognized, mainly:
  + strong use of helper methods
  + great pair work - loved seeing the dynamic of raising each other up and making sure each is on the same page.

### Pair Feedback

#### Project 1 (Partner Name):

**Feedback for Ben Ross:**

> Ben,

It was one heck of a week and we came out looking pretty darn good. Mostly due to your fantastic grasp on the Ruby language. Even as someone with just a few months of exposure to the language, you're making strides that I am truly envious of. Throughout the time we spent working on our project, I was constantly impressed with your drive for completion. Although our goal was not necessarily project completion, you took that challenge very seriously and put in long hours to achieve a working version of our program. I did experience many moments where I couldn't follow the pace that you were moving at, which mostly stemmed from nothing but an enormous knowledge gap between you and I. I've seen your desire to see others succeed and your character proves that you're just as focused on others as you are on yourself. As your knowledge of the Ruby language deepens so will your proficiency in the knowledge of "next level" pairing with other individuals from all skill levels. I would highly suggest that you double down efforts to recognize when your partner might be lost to the point of disconnection. We truly experienced a few tense moments, yet we both came out the other side with a project we could both say we truly contributed to in our own meaningful ways. I appreciate the learning experience we shared and the friendship that we've been able to launch throughout that time. I look forward to the chance that we will collaborate again in the near future and using the lessons learned on this endeavor to make the next project an even more focused and exciting growth experience for both of us. Keep up the great work and never be afraid to step out of your comfort zone!

Your partner in code, Joel Lindow


**Feedback from Ben Ross:**

"I know that you have a lot on your plate Joel, and I respect the fact that you are at Turing putting the time and effort in to improving your life, and the lives of everyone in your family. Kudos. I know you feel like this material is really difficult to understand. I think that that's how it's going to be for a lot of us, for a while. I saw many things clicking with you towards the end of our project, it was great to see. I saw how smart you are when you dig into a subject and how enthusiastic you become. You really gave our partnership a lot of energy at the end when that was just what we needed. Keep it up. I guess for the sake of giving you something to work on in terms of pairing I will mention one thing. When you started to have concepts click and you were getting ideas about what needed to happen, your energy level was quite high.  While it was difficult for me to juggle complex ideas in my head along with your exuberantly delivered suggestions, I will say it also injected some much needed spirit into the situation.  Also, most of your ideas were spot on. So if I were to give any suggestion at all, I would say, be aware of the multiple affects your excitement has while coding, and apply strategically."
