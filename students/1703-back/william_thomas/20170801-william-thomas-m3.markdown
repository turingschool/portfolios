# William Thomas - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Throughout module 3 there were several goals I set out to accomplish for myself. My initial focus was to encompass all of the aspects I have learned throughout my time here at Turing thus far, and to expand my knowledge by incorporating new topics within my projects. After acquiring the skills to be able to consume and build api's, I finally feel that I have a full understanding of backend development and will be confident in regards to my post Turing career.

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/wthoma22/apicurious-github)**

>* \<Description>

In this project, we’ll be focusing on consuming and working with data from public APIs.

As a vehicle for learning these concepts, we’ll be selecting an API from a popular website and working to re-construct a simplified version of the website’s existing UI using their own API. For example, you might decide to use the Twitter API to build a basic version of the Twitter feed where users can view and post tweets.

As we build these features, we’ll also be working with the OAuth protocol to authenticate our users with the third-party provider, and using various testing techniques to allow us to test against the third-party data.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>

As one of the initial introductions to api consumption, I enjoyed this project very much. I especially enjoyed using an Omniauth authentication library for authenticating users with a third party service.
This was also an amazing opportunity to try to mimic the css from the Github website for front-end and styling implementation.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine]https://github.com/wthoma22/rails_engine)**
>* \<Description>

In this project, you will use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>

One of the best experiences from this project was dividing the work and practicing git workflow with a partner. This project was the perfect exposure to building a JSON API and helped me to develop a greater understanding of routes within a rails project. It also introduced me to more complex ActiveRecord queries and business intelligence which I have grown quite fond of.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/wthoma22/cloney_island_airbnb)**
>* \<Description>

In this project, you’ll be building a new platform from scratch to handle multiple types of users (guests, registered users & admins). You’ll build a new project assigned by the instructors. This is sometimes called “greenfield” development, because you are starting from scratch.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>

Throughout my time at Turing this has been one of my favorite projects. As a team, we were finally able to take on more challenging problems and come up with interesting solutions. This was when I began feeling more confident with my developer capabilities and a sense of being able to tackle any problems without depending on external help. It is amazing to see how far we have all progressed and this project proved how much knowledge we have obtained within the past three modules.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://github.com/wthoma22/kickstarter_clone)**
>* \<Description>

Taking on Cloney Island Spring 1 as a "brownfield" development.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>

In my opinion, this is one of the best projects Turing can offer its students. Within our careers we will almost always if not always be working on code that has been created by someone else. It was a unique experience in multiple ways. One being a realization of how challenging it is to work on someone else's code. It can be extremely challenging at first to understand where the previous developers head was at or what they were wanting to accomplish with each step. This led me to always want to be more careful with my code for future developers. I believe this will be a great talking point for potential employers and was all in all one of the best opportunities Turing has offered.

## C. **Gear Ups**

MicroAggressions
> [Link To GearUp](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

My takeaways from this gear up are too understand how to identify micro aggressions as well as how to respond to them when in a situation where a micro aggression may have occurred. It was interesting to be placed in different scenarios and asked how we would react. This placed us in others shoes and also made myself be more prepared in case an unfortunate situation arises in which I need to speak up.

Allyship
> [Link To GearUp](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)

My takeaways from this gear up are similar to the first gear up. In the initial microaggressino gear up we focused on inequality and injustices and speaking up against these situations. This gear up seemed to be a more in depth version of how we can address these issues upon encountering them. We learned how to use our relationships and daily interactions to challenge discrimination. I have become more aware of privilege throughout my time here and have learned ways to use this privilege to support marginalized groups.

Session one: Looking good
> [Link To GearUp](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JrdIvzIwLUIn_lvMM6mHsACgPUGy6sbA6ca13mYyCSg/edit#gid=1301196065)

My takeaways from this gear up was very beneficial for my professional development. The gear up brought up the impact of body language and how it can affect the world around you. Holding yourself in a more confident manner can help you become more confident as an individual and increase your happiness and success. Since communication is 80% body language, it is important to understand the positive and negative affects it has and use this to your benifit.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**

My biggest community contribution was volunteering with Build in Colorado.
I am also friends with one of the founders of Develop Denver and may be helping next week during the conference.

#### **Posse**
  >* \<Blurb about what you did with your posse over the module>

  Our posse focused on helping student in earlier mods with questions. We also took on various interview questions such as Big O Notation and touched on these concepts.

  >* \<Your favorite thing about the posse experience>

  My favorite thing about this posse experience was meeting other individuals throughout Turing whom I may not have had the opportunity to meet otherwise.

  >* \<How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?>

  This posse experience helped me grow as a professional by helping me refresh old concepts to help students in earlier mods, and by having me look into new computer science topics.
