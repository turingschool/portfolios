# Chris Smith - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Starting Turing with a background as a web developer, my main focus of Mod 1 was establishing a strong foundation in coding best practices as well as learning Ruby.  My specific foundational focus was around TDD, OOP and single purpose classes/methods.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

#### Project 1 (Natalia Colome):

**Feedback for Natalia:**

> Natalia was great to work with.  She had a strong understanding of the Ruby methods and code organization we needed to complete this project.  We worked well as a team and were able to clearly talk through any challenges we came across.  Upon reflection, one of the things I think we both agree we could have done better is be more skeptical and/or play devil's advocate. This would have helped us catch holes in our testing/logic.  Since used the driver/navigator style for the project, we didn't get as much of a chance to practice our Git branching and pull requests or to do code presentations/reviews.  I look forward to working with Natalia again.

**Feedback from Natalia:**

> I think we worked very well together and we found balance in our contributions to the project. I really appreciate the way you organized our work, how you accepted my input and improved the code with your better knowledge of Ruby.  Also, you are very resourceful, always bringing additional features to improve our work and most of all, you are a great teacher. I think you have great communication skills and I enjoyed our time working together. With regard to opportunities to improve, I think it applies to both of us, we were so happy with our work we didn’t tested it correctly so it’s important to be aware of this and try to get an extra set of eyes or be more cautious in the future. Also, we worked really well as Driver-Navigator so we never tried Distributed Pairing, and it would have been interesting to try it.

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset

##### How do you think past experiences or experiences this week that have encouraged growth or fixed mindsets?
While I have not been exposed to Dweck's theory before, in reflecting back on my life, I have been fortunate to be able to live mostly with this perspective.  I appreciate the idea of emphasizing growth more than intelligence/knowledge.  I am coming to Turing with a stronger than most background in programming and have already seen people fall into the trap of thinking I am better at them than this or "smarter".  However, we all, my self especially came to Turing to struggle, to fight, to grow.  If we wanted to simply be successful and comfortable, we could have stayed in our previous lives.  We are here to grow.  This is important to always keep in mind in the future when someone else understands a concept faster than I do.  This is not because I'm 'dumb' but an opportunity for me to grow.
##### What are your triggers, what's likely to move you to fixed mindset?
Seeing someone else get something first is definitely a trigger for me.  Also, if I struggle with a problem long enough, I can feel like I'm in a corner and just can't get it.  
##### What can you peers do to support you staying in the growth mindset?
Knowing that I don't need to be a master at everything right away.  Mastery is earned, not given because of someone's intelligence. Asking for help from others and giving help to others. Sharing the process of understanding a concept does a lot in my view keep us all in that growth mindset.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things

Sierra's talk was very helpful in visualizing the process of becoming an expert at something.  I was struck, but how I could relate it to my own web development path.  I would struggle with basic things like learning how to start and end an HTML doc.  Then i Was struggling with  how to understand OOP and read others' code or work with a testing framework.  Struggling to always keep up on the latest language. Which language to learn... How can I understand examples.  I instinctively knew that I needed to get out of my house, away from online tutorials and surround myself with people who knew how to do what I was trying to do better than I did... Turing...

I am frustrated by the examples of perceptual learning because I always want to know WHY.  However, I have also seen its positive effects in my life and know that it is a very powerful thing if you can just lean into it and be comfortable with the initial discomfort and trusting your instincts.

I identify a lot with Coate's article!  I have studied languages.  I went to Middlebury.  I know the feeling of hopelessness.  The frustration of JUST NOT GETTING SOMETHING.  How psychologically dangerous the negative spiral can be.  I also know to be okay with being an infant in a topic.


#### Session 3: Introvert, Extroverts & Ambiverts

##### Where have you been successful in maintaining a growth mindset?
Being open to new learning methods, learning new information, reaching out to people for help.
##### Where have you been challenged in maintaining a growth mindset?
I have been challenged thus far in not feeling challenged enough with the curriculum. Also on the occasions when I get stuck falling into a feeling of "i'm never going to figure this problem out"
##### What new strategies have you identified to help you strengthen your growth mindset?
Being open to asking for and offering help
##### What did you hear from people who were opposite ends of the spectrum from you?
That it can be challenging for them as well at Turing because of the lack of opportunity for interaction/not being able to contribute to conversations.
##### What would it require for you to give someone else what they needed to be at their best?
Listening seems to be the key component.  That allows us to be respectful of the energies of each member of the team.
##### How can you leverage your place on the spectrum of introversion/extroversion to impact your career in the future?
Being aware and honest with myself and how my energy flows.  When I need to work, finding comfortable places to do that.  Setting boundaries when I need to use Extroverted energy and planning ahead so I have a quiet night before a networking event or social activity.

#### Session 4: Strengths and Storytelling

* Look at your initial StrengthsFinder reflection that you completed in week 1 -- how have your perceptions of the top 5 themes changed?
I feel like my perceptions haven't changed that much.  Most of my StrengthsFinder reactions were around hard work, learning, the thrill of discovery and being introspective and open to helping others.  I believe that remembering those as primary strengths has helped me in the intervening weeks of Turing, but haven't really changed my perceptions of them.

* How are you different today than when you first started at Turing? Where are you stronger now than on day 1?
I think I am stronger at looking for the challenge; knowing that if whatever I am doing feels easy, I should be pushing harder. I feel better connected to and invested in the success of the people around me and more committed to Turing being the right place for me. I am definitely stronger in dissecting programming problems, seeing solutions broken down into smaller accomplishable pieces and hopefully I am getting better at "socratic" teaching.

* Considering how you describe these themes, how do you want others to see you as you continue to progress through Turing?
I want to be approachable to others when they have a question, need to talk through a problem and/or just need to distract from being stuck at the moment.  One of the StrengthsFinder things that came out, which surprised me, was that visionary thinkers come to me for a reality check.  I have often been in that position and usually felt it was somehow a deficit.  I still have some unpacking there, but Turing has helped remind me there is value in being the realist/boots on the ground/how are we actually going to do this thing person.

* How might these themes play a role in describing your Turing story?
I think knowledge and challenge seeking is definitely part of my "why Turing".  As I mentioned in the first response, hard work and challenge are important for me.  I definitely thrive in an environment where I am able to push myself further in areas that interest me and where hard work pays off. In my previous business, I had reached a stagnation point where, the work that was required was not interesting or challenging enough.

* Even though your Turing story isn't finished yet, what do you envision for your development in future mods? How will this story end?
I definitely think that looking forward to my future "Turing story" these will be defining themes.  I will need to be cognizant of seeking out the interesting challenges and looking for job situations that are least likely to stagnate quickly.

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap

##### How are your experiences here at Turing similar or different than those shared in the documentary?
I feel like the Turing experience has been different from what is portrayed in the movie.  The community has a higher representation of women than the industry in general and, very importantly, actively talks about and engages the systemic problems. There can still be a gender influence here.  I feel like many of the female students I talk to have expressed similar experiences or at the very least struggled with the added cognitive load of believing they may not be getting something because of their nature/who they are.

##### What role do I play?
This is the pivotal question for me.  This is the second time I've watched this movie this year and even more the second time than the first, I finished it with two overwhelming emotions... I'm pissed! and simultaneously at a loss.  I feel like my very presence or my successes in the industry furthers the problem and reinforces the stereotype.  I know that I can and should 1) always be aware of my own actions and the environment around me and 2) speak up when something wrong is happening.  However, I don't want to just take a passive role (waiting until something happens) I want to be part of the proactive solution, but I don't know what concrete steps to take and I am worried about falling into the stereotype or being perceived as acting out the role of the "man to the rescue"

##### Brainstorm a specific situation I've witnessed or heard about at Turing.
I cannot point to a specific situation at Turing.  As I mentioned, many of my female friends have spoken about similar experiences and struggles.

### Community Participation

While at Turing, I have tried to be a strong and productive presence in the community.  Outside of class and answering the occasional questions about work or projects, I spoke as part of the HAccessibility Spike for the Pahlka Posse, attended a couple of Woz Poz meetings, led a 1703 BE review spike and volunteered as a TA for the Try Turing weekend.  Next mod, I am considering becoming involved in leading a Posse or at the very least in focusing in on one.
