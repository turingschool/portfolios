-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/ACC25/consume-github)**
>* A web app that consumes the GitHub API and displays basic account information, summary feeds, and repositories. It uses OAuth to authenticate each user.
>* It was great practice working with an API and helped solidify my knowledge of Faraday.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/ACC25/rails_engine)** 
>* This project was designed to mimic a sales data API, where you can query merchants, customers, invoices, transactions, items, and their associations.
>* I was weak in SQL and ActiveRecord before this project and this helped me understand how to join multiple tables together in a query.

> **Cloney Island**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/ACC25/trail-up)** 
>* Trail Up allows users to browse from thousands of trails across North America and create hiking events, and connect with other outdoor enthusiasts.
>* It was tough keeping up with the pace of my groupmembers, but it was really rewarding to see how much could be accomplished in two weeks with a passionate team.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://github.com/squeemishly/dark_clout)** 
>* The goal of this project was to inherit an already working codebase and build upon the existing functionality. The original app was a clone of 'Dropbox', so we opted to use your documents, images and Facebook 'public profile' and photos to visualize how much information you are exposing when you authorize with Facebook.
>* It was a great, and terrible, experience working on another groups codebase. I had a lot of fun scanning documents and figuring out what I could do with them. It reminded me how much I like working with language and I think I'm going to start working on a natural language analyzer of some sorts on the side.
