 *

### End of Module Assessment
Assessed By: Mike
Challenge: Top Plays

Notes:

* Used Rspec. Yuck.
* Put logic in model
* refactored to use AR

1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking
4: Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way

2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library
4: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions using the best-choice tools Ruby has to offer

3. Rails Syntax & API
4: Developer is able to smoothly utilize Rails methods and structures with a minimum of debugging or support

4. Rails Style
4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and push business logic down where it belongs

5. Testing
3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development

6. Collaboration
4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

### Attendance

I believe I had perfect attendance this module.


### Projects

I worked on the following projects over the course of the module

N/A

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### (Traffic Spy)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jpease1020/traffic-spy)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

  I was assessed by Jeff and these were his comments and scores:

  Bret and Justin and Justin:
  instructor_evaluation: Mike
    notes:
      * Some better separation of tests could be used.
      * Some methods were very long
      * Some lines > 80 characters
      * Would like to have seen better breaking out of view into partials.
      * 275 assertions, test coverage was 98 percent 65 tests
      * Design was clean
      * Worked as advertised.

    *  Functional Expectations: 3
    *  Test-Driven Development: 3
    *  Encapsulation / Components: 3
    *  Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
    *  Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
    *  View Layer: 3*

Bret had these nice things to say:

Justin was the strongest in our group and in clutch situations was able provide the solution to move forward. He communicated well for the most part, showed up on time, and keep a extremely positive attitude the entire duration of the project. I hope the feeling is mutual, but I really enjoyed pairing with him.

No negative experiences - but areas for improvement (actually for both of us):

1. Slowing down just a tad bit when getting stuck on a problem. Slowing down and taking a step back might help break through walls.

2. Both of us need to get better about this! Sometimes we went down rabbit holes instead of stopping and thinking about the problem. This relates back to number one. As improvement we should take breaks every 30 minutes and/or walk away/move on from the problem especially when we are just trying to hack our way through a problem.

##### My Contribution

  I coded the bulk of the algorithmic back-end. I was instrumental in setting up
  the relationships between the models. And pushed the team to TDD as much as
  possible.

##### Takeaway

  * HTTP makes sense. Its not hard or complicated. The practice was great.
  * I would rather be rails'ing.

#### (Little Shop of Orders)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rasensio1/faster_food)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/dinner_dash.html)

  This project is a slight spin off of the Dinner Dash project.

  It was super fun to see exactly how a project could come together in relation
  to the real world.

  Our team has all three extensions finished including:

  * Stripe payments
  * Twilio for text message alerts when food is ordered
  * An order delivery calculator to determine how long until an order is
  delivered.

  Have heard from at least 6 people that they are envious of our project.

##### My Contribution

  I was just a typical dev on this project. That being said I still drove much
  of the UX discussion and pushed the team to adopt good github and TDD
  practices. Code contributions are sprinkled through the project but a few key
  pieces:

  * Admin dashboard
  * Stripe
  * Cart
  * Order creation - order processing
  * Twilio

##### Takeaway

  * I really like having a product to show off.
  * I really like working on a high functioning team.
  * A lot of larger pieces are starting to fall in place as I see how they can
  interact. Admin functionality (its really just ruby inheritance).

## Community

### Giving Feedback

  * I'm the unofficial coffee maker.
  * I helped a few different 1508'ers with projects on multiple occasions (was
  mentioned in 3 shout outs).
  * I attended DSA 4 out of 6 weeks. I also tried to talk other people into coming to DSA
  * I led a session on Recursion with Ryan Asensio.
  * I am always available to help people when they need help (and I get asked
  for help several times a day from people within and without of my cohort)
  * I try to keep a positive attitude all the time (even when I'm not feeling it)
  because I know that others appreciate it.

### Playing a Part

## Review

### Notes

* We would like to see you lead some more non programming specific activities.

### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 4: Student demonstrates excellent growth by not only achieving satisfactory
evaluations for each project but also pushing their learning beyond expectations.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the
people around them.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
