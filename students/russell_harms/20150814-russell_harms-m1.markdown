# Russell Harms - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I didn't set goals for the module. I joined turing with the goal of learning to program and to work with other programmers better. I didn't segregate this module from the larger goals I had for these seven months.

### End of Module Assessment

#### Notes

* Does not create a new invoice.
* Sanitation - Zero complaints
* Great test of randomness.
* Spec Harness generates 9 errors. 12 minutes, 19 seconds.
* Test suite consists of 149 tests, missing unit tests and some coverage of models.
* 5 failing tests.
* Application only made use of #each

#### Scores

* Functional Expectations: 2
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
* Enumerables and Collections: 2
* Code Sanitation: 4

### Attendance

No missed time.

### Work

I completed the following individual projects this module:

#### Robodoku

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/russelleh/robodoku)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/robodoku.markdown)

The first project assigned was to build an automated sudoku solver. This was my first experience building test driven software from the ground up.

Assessed By: Jeff

Assessment Notes:

* use more commits / smaller steps, not manual backups
* good implementation of a Cell and good tests
* able to solve many problems

Score:

1. Functional Expectations: 4, solved 40 of Horace's puzzles
2. TDD: 3, good test count and coverage
3. Encapsulation: 3, like the cell/solver split
4. Fundamental Ruby: 3, good code
5. Enumerable: 3, functional but watch out for patterns

#### Binary Search Tree

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/russelleh/binary_search_tree)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown)

This was the first project where I elicited team help to a strong degree. The first thing I did on the project was going to the whiteboard with Alon, Matt H, and Ryan. This was also cool because it was my introduction to recursion in Ruby, which helped me understand a lot of other projects. The "linked list" idea was revisited later, and I feel that doing this project allowed me to finish that one a lot faster.

Assessment Notes:

* 26 tests all passing
* Good flow to the tests
* Some testing of edge cases but would like to see more
* Missing import from file, does it from CLI instead
* Can call methods from the CLI which is neat
* Output to CLI instead of file
* Delete has a bug but is mostly there
* Implementation is clear despite nested conditions

Score:

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable: 3

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/russelleh/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

This was the first scary assignment. I was trying to juggle helping classmates and finishing the project on time, and I was overconfident about how much work I could get done at home (not very much, which is why I'm here in the first place.) I had a lot of experience helping classmates and realizing how hard things are to explain.

Assessment Notes:

* Solid encrypt/decrypt, didn't get crack
* Good overall testing, room to stretch the boundaries
* Be careful with the project spec about interaction expectations
* Implementation code looks solid

Score:

* Functionality: 2
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
