# Russell Harms - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I didn't set goals for the module. I joined turing with the goal of learning to program and to work with other programmers better. I didn't segregate this module from the larger goals I had for these seven months.

### End of Module Assessment

#### Notes

* Does not create a new invoice.
* Sanitation - Zero complaints
* Great test of randomness.
* Spec Harness generates 9 errors. 12 minutes, 19 seconds.
* Test suite consists of 149 tests, missing unit tests and some coverage of models.
* 5 failing tests.
* Application only made use of #each

#### Scores

* Functional Expectations: 2
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
* Enumerables and Collections: 2
* Code Sanitation: 4

### Attendance

No missed time.

### Work

I completed the following individual projects this module:

#### Robodoku

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/russelleh/robodoku)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/robodoku.markdown)

The first project assigned was to build an automated sudoku solver. This was my first experience building test driven software from the ground up.

* use more commits / smaller steps, not manual backups
* good implementation of a Cell and good tests
* able to solve many problems

1. Functional Expectations: 4, solved 40 of Horace's puzzles
2. TDD: 3, good test count and coverage
3. Encapsulation: 3, like the cell/solver split
4. Fundamental Ruby: 3, good code
5. Enumerable: 3, functional but watch out for patterns
