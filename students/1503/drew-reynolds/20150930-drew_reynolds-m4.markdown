# Drew Reynolds - Graduation Portfolio
​
## Individual
​
### Areas of Emphasis
​
Since the beginning of module 3, I wanted to go above and beyond to become the "Javascript" person of our cohort. I feel like I have learned many tools that made me a better JS developer (debugger, console.log, & breakpoints). Building projects like Game Time, Reading List, & Idea Box gave me the freedom to explore more advanced techniques like incorporating AJAX. In the end, I feel like my time was very well spent at Turing and has prepared me for my first full-time developer role.

### End of Module Assessment

Reviewer: Horace Williams
​
* [Github URL](https://github.com/NYDrewReynolds/goober)
* [Original Assessment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/goober.markdown)
​
* Satisfactory Progress: 3
* Ruby Syntax & Style: 3
* Rails Style & API: 4
* Testing: 3
* User Interface: 4
* Javascript (if applicable) N/A
​
Notes:
* Nice use of helper methods to keep view code clean
* Keep pushing logic down from helpers into models (helpers are great but should mostly be an interface into model logic)
* Effective management of dual-role system on top of single users table -- keep in mind you can structure your routes and controllers more liberally even if it's just 1 table
* (i.e. have separate rider / driver routes and controllers even if they share a table)
* Tests look good; good use of integration tests for high-level coverage; keep looking for logic to push into model layer and at the same time include in unit tests
* Map code ends up real simple and easy
​

### Attendance
​
This module I attended all days and classes on-time.
​
### Work
​
I completed the following individual work this module:
​
#### Idea Box
​
Reviewer: Margarett Ly
​
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NYDrewReynolds/idea-box)
* [Original Assessment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)
​
* Features: 3
* User Interface: 4
* Testing: 3
* Rails Style: 4
* Ruby Style: 4
* JS Style: 4
​

Notes:
* Tests have excellent coverage of edge cases for model tests.
* Tests are clear and easy to understand. Feature tests could cover more user interface.
* JS code is clean and easy to read. Callbacks could be extracted into separate functions.
* Responsibilities of each function are clear and intuitive.
* Excellent code quality, code is very clear, concise, and clean across the board.
* I like your use of rails helper methods and gems. App is very easy for users to navigate and the interface is very intuitive.

#### Scale Up
​
Reviewer: Horace Williams
​
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NYDrewReynolds/scale-up)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)
​
* Production Deployment & Performance Monitoring: 3
* Load Testing / User Scripting: 2
* Database Load: yes
* Optimization Techniques: 2
* Features - Pagination yes
​

Notes:
* Got most of the pieces in place -- pagination, DB seeding, etc
* Load Script is ~ 75% ; missing a few more actions
* App is running inconsistently; sometimes perf is looking fine but then periodic lockups / memory errors
* Initial hiccups with seeding process seem to have delayed overall project progression

#### Practice Assessment
​

​
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NYDrewReynolds/reading-list)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/goober.markdown)
​
* Progress: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Rails Style: 3
* JS: 3
* Testing: 2
* UI: 4

## Team
​
### Projects
​
I participated in the following team projects:
​
#### Game Time
​
Reviewer: Horace Williams
​
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NYDrewReynolds/snake)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)
​
This project was to learn how to build a game that is playable in the browser.
​
* Functional Expectations: 4
* TDD: 2
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental JS & JS Style: 3
* Code Sanitation (JSHint): 4
​

Notes:
* Solid snake app with some cool features
* Good application of OO JS style
* Testing needs some work - really a symbiotic problem between code and test; too many things relying on DOM/canvas
* Might be interesting to experiment with a totally separate renderer function or object which slurped those things out of the other objects
​

#### Flack
​
Reviewer: Horace Williams
​
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NYDrewReynolds/flack)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flack.markdown)
​
* Services - 4
* Encapsulation - 3
* Rails MVC - 3
* TDD - 4
* Project Management - 3
* Concept - 2
* Deployment - 2
* Features - 3; got basic auth and standard chat setup with multi rooms; next steps would have been to push this further


Notes:
* Testing seems great
* Pretty successful effort working with multi-application architecture and managing data flow through the various pieces
* Chat UI is pretty nice although basic UI of the rest of the app suffers
* Didn't get too deep into the theming / product aspects of the project
* Supporting multi channels successfully is cool
* Took a stab at deploying but need to figure out env variable management
* Got lots of practice with node
* interesting use of rails-side rendering to distribute html partials to chat participants

## Community
​
### Giving Feedback
​
From others:
* Drew is wonderful to work with. He is very collaborative and open to new ideas. He is definitely killing the job hunt with over 40 resume submissions. He is very hard-working, and loves to contribute back to the community. I’m excited to see all the things he does in his career.
* Drew has matured so much over his time at Turing
* Drew is one of those guys that adds to the group. His charisma and eagerness to collaborate (or collaborave?) to the group provides an awesome group dynamic. 1503 wouldn’t be the same without its little Drewby.
​

### Playing a Part
​
* Volunteered for Xcel Energy representing Turing School with Dave Maurer & Tan Doan [Recap Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNA3VmzxoQ)
