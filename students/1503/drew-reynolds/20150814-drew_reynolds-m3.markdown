# Drew Reynolds- M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

At the beginning of this module, I wanted to go above and beyond to become the "Javascript" person of our cohort. Exercisms turned out to be more challenging than I was prepared for early on so I have spent a majority of my time working through Codecademy courses. Throughout the module, I have worked on multiple courses such as the Javascript, jQuery, AngularJS, Using APIs with Javascript, and the Using the SoundCloud API (with Javascript) courses. To put them to the test in our Self-Directed Project, I consumed the SoundCloud API with Javascript and the main feature of my project relied heavily on AJAX.

## Work

#### Collaborave

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NYDrewReynolds/collaborave)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.markdown)

The goal of this project is to create a successful web application from a project idea. You will create an app that will authenticate with a third-party service, consume an api, and solve an actual problem.

* Completion: 4
* Organization: 3
* Test Drive Development: 2
* Code Quality: 3
* User Experience: 4
* Performance: 4

#### APIcurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NYDrewReynolds/twitter-clone)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown)

For APICurious, I built a Twitter Clone that authenticated & pulled in information about who the User followed. I created a feed where users could Favorite Tweets in their feed and Send out new ones too.

* Server-Side Application and APIs: 2 - Project uses an external API, but usage is scattered across the application OR its usage is not effectively tested.
* Test-Driven Development: 2 - The code demonstrates high test coverage (>60%), but does not adequately balance feature and unit tests.
* Features: 3 - All planned features were delivered.
* Interface: 2.5 - The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects.

#### SupperSkip

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NYDrewReynolds/pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/supper_skip.markdown)

Supper Skip took a past student's Dinner Dash and turn it into a much larger app using multitenancy.

* Feature Completion - 2
* Project Organization - 4
* Test-Driven Development - 4
* Code Quality - 2.5
* User Experience - 2

### Feedback To Me

I hope I can work in a group with you in Module 4. You are a great collaborator, and it makes sense now why your personal app is Collaborave.

After personally working with Drew on a project, I can say his work ethic and drive to contribute are both admirable. His understanding of how the pieces fit together, coupled with his ability to research answers quickly make him an asset. He's also incredibly personable, which makes being on a team with him enjoyable from more than a contributory standpoint.

Hey Drew You're one of the nicest funniest people I've met!
And you're always pleasant to work with :)
