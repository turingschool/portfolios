# Morgan Miller - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
Coming into Module 4, I wanted to make myself more marketable to potential employers by learning a JS framework. I started learning React about halfway through the module, and ended up building Flack in React as well as using it for my final project. In terms of technical ability, I feel like achieved more at Turing than I expected to coming into it - It was enlightening to go through the 24 hour assessment and to only turn to Google for gem documentation and some React stuff I was still shaky on.

As far as finding a job, I selected about a dozen companies to reply to and got through 2nd rounds for 2 of them. Although I didn't have as many interviews as I expected to for this module, I was surprised at how comfortable I was during the phone conversations that I did have with prospective employers. Software development aside, applying for jobs (and even college/graduate schools) has always been one of the most daunting things to me. I don't think I've ever brought as much confidence to the table as I have in the last couple of weeks, which in some ways is a bigger win than the programming knowledge itself.

## Team

### Projects

#### Flack

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/morganmiller/flack)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flack.markdown)

Rebuilding Slack with (or without, as the case may be) a theme. Teamed up with Justin and Margarett.

Comments:
Great exploration of some interesting SOA and use of React for some front-end management. Didn't get far into the product / concept aspects of the project, but it seems like we got some interesting technical learning along the way.

Glad to see we got a lot of practice with JS both on the server and the client side. Major bonus points for the React frontend. Sounds like Margarett got pretty close to a working implementation of a canvas / live-drawing system, but just didn't quite get it put together at the end.

Scores:
* Services - 4
* Encapsulation 3
* Rails MVC - 3
* TDD - 3
* Concept - 2 - mostly just vanilla chat app at this point
* Deployment - 2 - attempted to deploy on heroku but hit some snags with node side
* Features - 3 - multi channel, auth
* Technical learning / experimentation - 4 -- lots of node and react usage
* Project Management - 3

#### GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/morganmiller/snake)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

Built an awesome game of snake with Brett.

Game is sweet; ui is cool and artisanally hand-crafted with nice pixels
Testing is very light; misses the opportunity to really get into the more interesting game logic stuff -- collisions, updating the game data, etc
Structure is making strides toward an interesting functional approach; still leaving too much stuff in the initial doc ready callback
Desired benefit of this functional approach is that it becomes easier to test because every function is clean input/output

* Functional Expectations: 4
* TDD: 2
* Breaking Logic into Components: 2
* Fundamental JS & JS Style: 3
* Code Sanitation (JSHint): 3

## Community

### Feedback

"Morgan is a badass and beyond smart. She is a hard-worker and I’m lucky to have had her as a cohort-mate. She can figure out any hard problem you throw her way, and is always super helpful! The team she ends up on will be very lucky to have her." - Sally

"I’ve been on 2 group projects with Morgan, and it’s always pleasant and enjoyable. She’s quick, incisive, and definitely one of the top people in our cohort. There is never a doubt that she won’t complete a task whenever she says she’s going to do it. Overall, she’s an awesome person!" - Justin

"Morgan is a serious go-getter. She showed this by challenging herself this module to learn React and put those skills on display in projects like Flack & the Final Assessment." - Drew R.


### Playing a Part

* made myself available to people when they needed help on projects
* went to some WWC meetups and repped Turing
* did a lightning talk about beloved community leader DJ.
* went to 1508 introductory happy hour

A note about playing a part: Module 4 tends to be a little more relentless than other modules insofar as time management goes. I definitely did less "part-playing" than in the previous 3 modules, when I considered myself to be a more active community member. I will say, however, that on the subject of community: I had the intention of rebuilding/strengthening relationships with people in my cohort after the absurdity that transpired at the end of Module 3, and I feel that I achieved that.

## Review

### Notes
* Learned more than thought you would comming in. Did very well on the final assessment. Felt very comfortable. 
* Scale up was a project that a lot was learned from. Had issues with production that held it back. 
* Great Mod 4 overall
* Flack - learned a lot about react and felt like a lot was accomplished. Did all of the react for this project. Had some issues deploying the app, but felt like a lot was learned overall. Didn't have a theme or concept either. 
* GameTime - Partnered with Brett and had a lot of fun workign on that project. Learned a lot together about JavaScript. Tried to write this project functionally and ended up half OO and half functional. 
* Mod 4 was a time of a lot fo extra work and wasn't around as much as previous modules. 
* Attempted to help rebuild the cohort after Mod 3 issues. Feels closer with cohort now as she did before. 
* Had some issue in mod 3 that made it hard to engage. 
* Mod 4 was favorite module. 
* Lesson learned that you were ok with the issues that transpired in Mod 3. And felt a lot stronger in the end because of it. 
* Group talk about the things in module three were maybe a little uneccesary. Felt like things would have been better if it was treated as an interpersonal issue than a group issue. The one pro was that there was some bonding becasue of that. 
* HORACE KILLED IT! HORACE!HORACE!HORACE!
