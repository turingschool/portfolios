# Morgan Miller - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Something about the fast pace and the ever-rotating project schedule of Turing has made it difficult for me to stay as engaged as I would like to be in my learning. Recognizing this, at the end of Mod 2, my goal for this module was to be more self-motivated, to start learning JavaScript, and use my personal project to explore new concepts. Over the course of this module I completed 6 JavaScript exercisms and implemented JQuery and JS libraries in my personal project.

Missing - Friday August 14th

### Work

I completed APICurious and Whats In A Word as my individual projects for module 3.

#### gitMe (APICurious)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/morganmiller/github-rebuild)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown)

A personalized Github dashboard to practice consuming API's. Project evaluated by Mike Dao.

Comments: No feed of people you follow, but no one got that. Has an awesome contribution chart. User model could use more testing. Does not test logout.

Scores:
Server-Side Applicaiton and APIs: 4 - Project wraps/isolates external API, tests API interaction without actual connectivity dependencies.
Test-Driven Development: 3.5 - The code demonstrates high test coverage (>70%), tests at feature and unit levels, but needs more model testing and a logout test.
Features: 3 - All planned features were delivered
Interface: 4 - The application is a logical and easy to use implementation of the target application.

#### Rales Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/morganmiller/rales-engine)
* [Original Assignment]()

Sales Engine on Rails. Evaluated by DJ.

Comments: None. Step it up DJ.

Scores:
Completion: 3 - Project completes all requirements according to the spec harness
Rails and ActiveRecord Style: 3 - Project makes good use of ActiveRecord to fulfill Business Reqs, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods
Ruby Style and Code Quality: 3 - Project uses idiomatic Ruby with a handful of larger methods or bloated controllers
API Design: 3 - Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features
Test Driven Design: 4 - Project has exceptional test coverage at various application levels, including coverage for edge cases and complicated logic methods

## Team

### Projects

Supper Skip was the only team project.

#### Eatsy (Supper Skip/Slog)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sallymacnicholas/supper_skip)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/supper_skip.markdown)

Slogging through the supper skip. Multitenancy app with restaurants and stuff.

Comments:
Good on several fronts -- test coverage, some use of ruby service objects, solid data modeling, looks ok. Would like to see more model/unit testing and more use of PORO's. Also my photo is somewhat low res.

Scores:
Feature Completion - 3: Completes all base features (through iteration 4) and 1 supporting feature
Project Organization - 4: Team makes great use of git workflow, project management tool, and iterative workflow
Test-Driven Development - 3: Solid test coverage. Slightly heavier reliance on one layer over another, and some gaps, but important features are generally well-covered.
Code Quality - 3: Solid code quality. A few small leaks of responsibility, but logic is pushed down the stack and generally clearly encapsulated.
User Experience - 4: UX is especially polished and intuitive

#### Personal Project
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/morganmiller/whats-in-a-word)
Notes

Testing: could use some integration testing but model testing is strong enough to compensate
Good use of VCR to isolate network connections
"Micro" code level is pretty clean with a few exceptions of crufty methods
Naming could be improved in several places (classes like "Parser" or "Requester")
Finally we do have a lot of things going on in the app and the hierarchy among methods in each object is not always easy to follow
Could potentially resolve this with more smaller objects which each grabs a handful of responsibilities
Some of the data parsing could be better written as a pipeline of filters on top of initial data set; currently the various steps and queries and transformations are somewhat tangled

Completion: 4 - Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.
Organization: 3 - Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
Test-Driven Development: 4
Code Quality: 3
User Experience: 4 - Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.
Performance: 2 - Project pages load on average under 500 milliseconds.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Filling out surveys when people post them! Generally I only gave feedback that was solicited.

### Playing a Part

* emptied/loaded dishwasher when it was clean or dishes were stacked
* whiteboarded with rebekah/rachel on sales engine
* paired with lovisa on JS exercisms
* student session on rails controller
* did 2 hour group lesson with rachel, rebekah, regis and adam on linked list
* often helped chelsea on self-directed projects
* was available to other students to answer questions or help debug
