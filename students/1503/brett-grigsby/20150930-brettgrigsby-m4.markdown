# Brett Grigsby - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this module was to get comfortable with Javascript, and what I actually
got a better understanding of functional programming. Turing usually takes my desire
to learn something, and teach me a better understanding of the concepts that 
encapsulate that something. So thanks for that.

Great job working through a fairly complicated project in a new language and environment. Appreciate your hard work experimenting with a lot of technical unknowns.
Use of clojurescript and websocket connections is pretty idiomatic, and you did a good job of working with reagent to construct the frontend.

### Fedback to Me




## Community

### Playing a Part
* Taught morning yoga AGAIN. Even after they stopped showing. Shoutout to Dave for keeping attendance at 1.
* Attended both Den of Clojures, even before I had a Clojure project.
* Participated in the Turing LAN over the last break.
* DSA even when every part of my brain said it was a bad idea.
* I made strides to be a resource for other students this module. Teaching is learning!
* A high contributor of "juice" during Student Advisory Board.
* Organized group gaming over many of our lunch periods

## Review

### Notes

* Yoga teacher that became a bad ass programmer.
* Brought a very authentic self to the community from day 1
* Loud at the times it was right to be loud and vice versa.
* People are comfortable interacting with you.

### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 4: Student demonstrates excellent growth by not only achieving satisfactory
evaluations for each project but also pushing their learning beyond expectations.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.


* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the
people around them.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
