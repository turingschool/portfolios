# Brett Grigsby - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this module was to individually create the full stack of a web
application. The desire to bring an idea to life was one of my biggest motivators
for attending Turing. After finishing Module 3, I finally geel confident in my
abilitiy to bring any idea to life.

### Attendance

I have missed 0 days of Module 3, although I did leave early on August 5th to pick up
a ring :).

### Work

I completed these 2 solo projects during this module:

#### Pantry Raid

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brettgrigsby/pantry_raid)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.markdown)

In this self-directed project, I created a web application manages the food you own
and the recipes you want to make. Using that data, the application can suggest things
you might make without shopping, generate a shopping list for the things you want to
make, or automate an order through Instacart to get your groceries delivered to you.

"Project exhibits a production-ready user experience."

* Completion: 4
* Organization: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Code Quality: 3
* User Experience: 3
* Performance: 2

#### APIcurious

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown)

"The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality"

* Server-Side Application and APIs: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Features: 3
* Interface: 3

## Team

### Projects

I truly feel that I have grown as a team member in this module. My growth was mostly
in accepting others' process for problem-solving, and letting go of a desire to control
ecery part of the end product. My teamates were awesome and hard working, and all I had
to do was realize and accept that.

#### Supper Skip

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brettgrigsby/supper_skip)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/supper_skip.markdown)

In this group project, we were given an old 'Dinner Dash' project which we turned into
a multitennancy platform. I gained a much more thorough understading of the session and
nested/namespaced resources during this project.

"Solid code quality. A few small leaks of responsibility, but logic is pushed down the stack
and generally clearly encapsulated."

* Feature Completion - 2
* Project Organization - 3
* Test-Driven Development - 3
* Code Quality - 3
* User Experience - 2
