# Erik Butcher - Module 3 Porfolio

## Individual

### Emphasis Areas

Coming into this module, I felt as if I needed to work with other people more effectively. The number of solo projects in the module made this difficult, but during the last week I made a concerted effort to pair, get assistance, and give assistance when possible. I still have a ways to go, but I am more confident in my skills as a team member.

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on time, with no exceptions.

### Assigned Work

This module I completed the following:

#### Self-Directed Project: Trouble Center

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/with-a-k/trouble-center)
* [Production Website](https://trouble-center.herokuapp.com)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.markdown)

In this two-week project, I created a help request board for the Internet. Users log in with a Twitter account to resolve other peoples' Troubles, although anyone can create a Trouble even if they don't have a Twitter. When a Trouble is solved, a tweet is sent from both the solver's Twitter and the creator's (if there is one.)

The project was jointly evaluated by Jorge (completion, organization, UX, performance) and Josh Cheek (TDD, code quality) with the following scores:

* Completion: 2 - Developer completed most of the user stories and requirements set by the client.
* Organization: 4 - Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* Test-Driven Development: 2 - 
* Code Quality: 3 - 
* User Experience: 2.5 - Project exhibits some gaps in the UX.
* Performance: 4 - Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.

#### APICurious

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/with-a-k/finite-scrollery)
* [Production Website](https://finite-scrollery.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown)

In this three-day project, I created an application acting as a facsimile of the website tumblr using its API. I was the only person taking Module 3 that decided to use tumblr for this project, out of several options. Jorge evaluated my project with the following results:

* Server-Side Application and APIs: 4 - Project wraps/isolates external API, tests API interaction without actual connectivity dependencies.
* Test-Driven Development: 1 - The code does not have 80% test coverage.
* Features: 3 - All planned features were delivered.
* Interface: 3 - The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### SupperSkip

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NYDrewReynolds/pivot)
* [Production Website](http://supper-skip.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/supper_skip.markdown)

In this two-week project, a team consisting of myself, Rob Cornell, Josh Cass, and Drew Reynolds reworked an old Dinner Dash project from 1406 or something to be a platform for multiple vendors. Jorge evaluated the project with the following results:

* Feature Completion - 2
* Project Organization - 4
* Test-Driven Development - 4
* Code Quality - 2.5
* User Experience - 2

## Team

### Feedback

I used an anonymous feedback form to gather feedback from other members of the cohort.

Common threads from feedback I've received include:
* Remarkable performance when in the groove.
* Notes that I have strong algorithmic thinking skills.
* Not unfounded concerns over my attentiveness and focus.
* Encouragement in terms of branching out socially.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

As we all know there was kind of a debacle about attendance especially as it pertains to Morgan. I feel bad that the community was in such a state to begin with, whether or not I was complicit in making it that way.

I don't feel particularly connected to anyone in the cohort and I feel like this is a problem (as I also brought up during Cohort Talk.)

### Playing a Part

This is the one thing I'm not sure how to do better in. In the feedback I was given someone noted that I'm very willing to help others with their problems, which is true (even if I can't help them right away I'll at least look at it). Beyond that I'm not sure what there is to do.
