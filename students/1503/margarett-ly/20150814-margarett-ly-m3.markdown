# Margarett Ly - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to build more robust Rails projects. I think that the nature of the large
projects in Module 3 made me learn how to do that. I learned a great deal about OAuth,
APIs, and testing. I also feel like the final project gave me a good nudge into
learning Javascript.

### End of Module Assessment

#### Self Directed Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/aoili/drank)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.markdown)

In this two week project, I created a web application from a project idea. The app authenticated with a third-party service, consumed at least one api, and solve an actual problem. It was evaluated by Jorge and Horace with the following results:

* Completion: 2 - Developer completed most of the user stories and requirements set by the client.
* Organization: 4 - Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Code Quality: 3
* User Experience: 3 - Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
* Performance: 1 - Project pages load on average over 500 milliseconds.

Notes:
* Would like to see more restful rails routing
* Avoid use of helpers for data logic -- push it into a model or PORO instead
* Javascript competence is clearly coming along but still could be more idomatic etc
* OO design contains the right pieces and is pretty good at the micro level (method design etc), but the relationships between components could be more clearly defined
* Testing is pretty good and I like that we address the external connections using Omniauth test mode and stubs
* Data modeling is interesting and makes reasonable use of the standard rails tooling; given the relative static-ness of the data it might be interesting to think about alternative modeling / storage systems (could we just hardcode the weather / drink data since it's static)

### Attendance

This module I attended all days with the exception of an absence on Friday, July 31st.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### APICurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/aoili/api_curious)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown)

In this four-day project I implemented Github OAuth and used the Github API to create
a simplified version of Github's UI. It was evaluated by Horace with the following results:

* Server-Side Application and APIs: 3 - Project wraps/isolates external API but has some gaps or external connections in its testing.
* Test-Driven Development: 2 - The code demonstrates high test coverage (>60%), but does not adequately balance feature and unit tests.
* Features: 2 - Some features were sacrificed to meet the deadline
* Interface: 2 - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective

#### RalesEngine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/aoili/rales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rales_engine.markdown)

In this four-day project I used Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema. It was evaluated by Jorge with the following results:

* Completion: 2 - Project completes most requirements but fails 4 or fewer spec harness tests
* Rails and ActiveRecord Style: 3 - Project makes good use of ActiveRecord to fulfill Business Reqs, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods
* Ruby Style and Code Quality: 3 - Project uses idiomatic Ruby with a handful of larger methods or bloated controllers
* API Design: 3 - Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features
* Test Driven Design: 2 - Project focuses tests on only a single layer of the stack, or has large gaps in the coverage

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### SupperSkip

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/vanegomez/supper_skip)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/supper_skip.markdown)

In this project we built upon an existing implementation of Dinner Dash, turning it from an ordering site for a single restaurant into a platform allowing individual restaurants to sell food online. It was evaluated by Horace with the following results:

* Feature Completion - 2: Is missing some base features
* Project Organization - 3: Team generally makes good use of git and project workflow, but has a few "git dump" PRs or dropped tickets
* Test-Driven Development - 1: Disregard for testing
* Code Quality - 2: Application of MVC leaks in some places. Several disorganized or poorly factored methods; largely suffering from lots of design and implementation churn
* User Experience - 2: Some gaps in the UX


## Community

### Giving Feedback

I gave feedback to all peers who requested it.

### Playing a Part

I received positive feedback from my peers. I paired and contributed to team projects
when requested. I participated in posse every morning and helped other students
troubleshoot bugs when I was asked for help. I am also going to be giving a lightning
talk on Friday, August 14.
