# Vanessa Gomez - Module 3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Reinforce what I learned in mod 2, as well as to understand consuming APIs and building one. At the end, I pushed to make better controller and model testing.

### End of Module Assessment

My progress through the module was assessed by Jorge Telez and  Josh Cheek and here are the results:

#### Self Directed Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/vanegomez/kindtripper)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.markdown)

I created a web app that made it easy and user friendly to find volunteer jobs abroad
and save them to a wish list. It authenticates with twitter and consumes Peace Corps API.

Comments:
1. The test that hits the api depends on the specific current data. This will be painful as it will likely change frequently and arbitrarily.
2. A nice small amount of JS to get just the right flourishes of interactivity (filtering / images)
3. Controllers were nice
4. No issues with any of the code
5. One thing we might do is pull the find_or_create_job method out of Opening and give it its own class or module.

* Test-Driven Development: 4 - Project shows exceptional use of testing at different layers - All Files (100.0% covered at 14.08 hits/line)
* Code Quality: 4 -  Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
* User Experience: 4 - Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.
* Performance: 4 - Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.

### Work

I completed the following individual project for this module:

#### APICurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/vanegomez/lightbox)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown)

I was able to consume and work with data from Instagram API.

I was assessed by Jorge Telez and here are the results:

* Server-Side Application and APIs: 2.5 - Project wraps/isolates external API but has some gaps or external connections in its testing.
* Test-Driven Development: 1 - The code does not have 80% test coverage.
* Features: 3 - All planned features were delivered.
* Interface: 4 - The application is a logical and easy to use implementation of the target application.

#### RalesEngine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/vanegomez/rales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rales_engine.markdown)

I able to use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.

I was assessed by DJ and here are the results:

* Completion: 3 - Project completes all requirements according to the spec harness
* Rails and ActiveRecord Style: 3 - Project makes good use of ActiveRecord to fulfill Business Reqs, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods
* Ruby Style and Code Quality: 3 - Project uses idiomatic Ruby with a handful of larger methods or bloated controllers
* API Design: 3.5 - Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features
* Test Driven Design: 2 - Project focuses tests on only a single layer of the stack, or has large gaps in the coverage.

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### SupperSkip

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/vanegomez/supper_skip)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/supper_skip.markdown)

We were able to build upon an existing implementation of Dinner Dash, turning it from an ordering site for a single restaurant into a platform allowing individual restaurants to sell food online.

It was evaluated by Horace with the following results:

* Feature Completion: 2 - Is missing some base features
* Project Organization: 3 - Team generally makes good use of git and project workflow, but has a few "git dump" PRs or dropped tickets
* Test-Driven Development: 1 - Disregard for testing
* Code Quality: 2 - Application of MVC leaks in some places. Several disorganized or poorly factored methods; largely suffering from lots of design and implementation churn
* User Experience: 2 - Some gaps in the UX

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I gave feedback to all the people who asked me.

### Feedback to me

1. "You are a lot of fun to work with and are very driven.  You have a strong grasp on the topics we have covered in the program and have a good eye for design.  I like working with you because you are able to discuss and problem solve without becoming arrogant or mean spirited.  You also help me understand things that may not have been clear before and you are not afraid to ask other people for help if you get stuck."
2. â€œVane is always a joy to work with on projects, working with her on Traffic Spy felt like we had a really balanced, great team. She is also incredibly kind, and a much appreciated part of 1503. :)"
3. "you have a great sense of humor! speak up more and thanks for working with me!"
4. "Vanessa is a hard worker who strives to understand every concept introduced. Her knowledge of Rails increases with every project, and she is always willing to share that knowledge with others."
5. "I think you are doing a great job. You work hard and it shows. I can remember helping you in the first module when you knew only a little programming. Now you are rocking out great projects and lightning talks."

### Playing a Part

* I gave two lighting talks this module, one on 2d to 3D video conversions and on typography on web.
* I paired with some students and helped them a bit on their projects.
* When I found useful info about coding/testing, I put it on slack for my classmates.
