# Vanessa Gomez - Module 4 Portfolio

### End of Module Assessment

My progress through the module was assessed by Horace

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/vanegomez/goober)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/goober.markdown#iteration-4---accepting-ride-requests-driver)

__Notes:__

* Testing is strong -- good mix of small granular tests and larger,
more sweeping tests
* Nice approach to the data modeling - splitting riders and drivers into
separate tables and managing that complexity
* Some room for improvement around managing data lifecycle (e.g and cost
 calculations) as we're going through various app states
* Pace still needs to be a little quicker -- didn't quite finish final
 iteration

__Evaluation:__

1. Satisfactory Progress 2
2. Ruby Syntax & Style 3
3. Rails Style & API 3
4. Testing 3
5. User Interface 4

## Individual Projects

### Practice Assessment - Reading List
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/vanegomez/reading_list)
* [Original Assignment](https://gist.github.com/worace/0fa8052bfcf983e8722d)

Instructor: Horace

Progress - 2
Ruby Style - 3
Rails Style - 3
JS - n/a
Testing - 3
UI - 4

### Scale Up
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/vanegomez/scale-up)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)

Instructor: Horace

Production Deployment & Performance Monitoring 3+
Load Testing / User Scripting 3
Database Load yes
Optimization Techniques 3
Features - Pagination yes
Very solid over all, achieves strong response time using simple but solid techniques include pagination and some view caching.

Next step would be to zero in on a few of the remaining slow queries, especially around the category / loan request queries.

### IdeaBox 2.0
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/vanegomez/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

__Reviewer:__Sally MacNicholas

Features: 1
User Interface: 3
Testing: 1
Rails Style: 3
Ruby Style: 3
JS Style: 3

Comments JS looked great! Nice partials! Could have finished more features.

## Group Projects

### Game Time 

Instructor: Horace

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/vanegomez/lights_out)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

Game UI is fun and useable; fancy use of css
Testing super thorough; seems to cover all cases in the small as well as the large
Firm application of OO style
Rendering logic encapsulated by each game component
Pretty good job of keeping jquery out of most of the code (isolating it to the rendering stuff)
Super solid application of OO JS style

Functional Expectations: 4
TDD: 4
Breaking Logic into Components: 4
Fundamental JS & JS Style: 3
Code Sanitation (JSHint): 3

Notes:
* Coming into module 4, it seems you were behind, and the stuff we did at the beginning of the module didnt seem to help. The question is if the stuff we did at the end of the module, was it enough.
* Scale up was good, just a miserable experience.
* 

Outcome:

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.


* 2: Student earned one score below "3" on the assessment
* 1: Student earned two or more scores below "3" on the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
