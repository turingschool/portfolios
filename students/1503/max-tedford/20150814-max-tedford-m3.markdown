# Max Tedford - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Entering module 3 I felt like my front-end skills were still quite raw and undeveloped,
and I wanted to circle back to M1-type Ruby algorithmic practice to keep them sharp after M2,
where we worked mostly in Rails. Thus, my two main goals this module were to put a concerted
effort into drilling more advanced Ruby techniques and building my front-end skill-set to make
myself a more versatile and well-rounded full-stack developer.
 
I turned to Exercism to both drill my advanced Ruby algorithmic skills and also get more experience
with JavaScript. I averaged 2 Exercisms each week, varying Ruby and JavaScript, and also consciously
took on a self-directed project that was challenging and pushed me outside my front-end comfort
zone, consuming the Google Maps JavaScript API--95% of my project relied on JavaScript and jQuery
for both API calls, and user experience. In addition, I attended four out of the available six
DSA sessions this module.

### Attendance

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### APICurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxtedford/apicurious)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown)

In this three-day project I implemented a Twitter emulator using the Twitter API. It was
evaluated by Horace with the following results:

* Server-Side Application and APIs: 3 - Project wraps/isolates external API but has some gaps or external 
connections in its testing.
* Test-Driven Development: 2 - The code demonstrates high test coverage (>60%), but does not adequately 
balance feature and unit tests.
* Features: 3 - All planned features were delivered.
* Interface: 3 - The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes
 in lesser-used functionality.

#### RalesEngine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxtedford/rales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rales_engine.markdown)

In this three-day project I built an app that provided API endpoints for consumption. It was
evaluated by Jorge with the following results:

* Completion: 2 - Project completes most requirements but fails 4 or fewer spec harness tests
* Rails and ActiveRecord Style: 4 - Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries,
including some advanced query functionality such as joins or includes
* Ruby Style and Code Quality: 3 - Project uses idiomatic Ruby with a handful of larger methods or
bloated controllers
* API Design: 2 - Project has inconsistencies or gaps in how its JSON data is organized or formatted
* Test Driven Design: 2 - Project focuses tests on only a single layer of the stack, or has large gaps
in the coverage

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### SupperSkip

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/levthedev/supper_skip)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/supper_skip.markdown)

In this ten-day project I worked with Lev and Jamie to transition a Dinner Dash project that
belonged to a previous cohort into a multi-tenancy restaurant platform. The project was evaluated
by Jorge with the following results:

* Feature Completion - 4
* Project Organization - 4
* Test-Driven Development - 4
* Code Quality - 3.5
* User Experience - 2

### Feedback to Me

I sent around a google form to the rest of my cohort-mates to solicit feedback to me. I got six replies. Here were the results:

Am I easy to communicate with?
* Always (6)

I benefit Turing as a whole
* Strongly Agree (6)

How would you describe my contributions to groups and teams?
* You were the glue that kept us together (4)
* You pulled your weight (2)

How would you describe my work ethic?
* Highly motivated and consistent (5)
* Strong (1)

Additional optional comments from peers:
* So, looking back, I haven't personally worked with you in a group, which is a bummer because I've seen how
you work with others and it seems very collaborative, respective environment, which makes it a great learning
environment. One project in particular, Supper Skip, I saw how well you helped you and your group plan out
the project, put together well-written stories, and made sure everyone in the group was on the same page and
understood the direction of the project. You took a leadership role with Supper Skip and it appeared to have
really worked well. Your team seemed really on track, focused, and very collaborative. Wished we had a chance
to work together. I think I would have learned a lot from you.
* Very motivated and organized.  Great to work with and an awesome person overall.
* I'm actually surprised you dont already have a job. You are a rockstar.
* Max is one of those rare people who is a strong performer, wrapped in a humble shell.  He is easy to
approach, does not condescend when explaining things, and lends a can-do outlook to his peers. When I say
Max was the glue that kept our team together, I can't emphasize enough how much of an impact he had on the
focus and direction we maintained. From the beginning he set the tone, and without actively announcing
himself as the lead, Max delegated and outlined the work flow through suggestions and prompted group
discussion. I would work with him again without hesitation.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Rob and Whitney requested feedback from me for their portfolios. I completed both their requests.

### Playing a Part

* On Friday, July 17, I delivered a lightning talk "Wine 102: How Technology is Changing the Wine Industry"
* On Friday, July 24, I purchased and delivered breakfast for all of Turing
* On Friday, July 31, I organized a Turing field day for students, staff, and families
* Throughout the duration of the module I participated in Student Advisory Board, providing
feedback to the staff on improving Turing. I unfortunately had to be absent from SAB on Thursday,
July 9 and Thursday, August 6. Otherwise, I attended regularly.
