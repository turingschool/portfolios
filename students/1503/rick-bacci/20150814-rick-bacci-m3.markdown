# Rick Bacci - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I wanted to continue to focus on maintaining  a
professional project workflow. This applies to both individual and group
projects. I also wanted to continue to improve on understanding the rest of
my teams thought process, and making sure that I am able to communicate my
thoughts as well.

### End of Module Assessment

Github: https://github.com/RickBacci/foobr Production: https://foobr.herokuapp.com

Notes

Code and tests are actually pretty good based on what is written
Nothing works at the moment
JS code is pretty clean
Use of VCR and omniauth stubbing for testing is good
Seem to have serious problems with process and attention to detail in development
Feels like projects are going well up to a point but then we get sidetracked
by some issue or malfunction
Need to be more reactive or adaptive when running into issues so that we can
find a way around rather than getting bogged down on a single issue

Completion: 2 - Developer completed most of the user stories and requirements set by the client.

Organization: 3 - Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
Test-Driven Development: 2
Code Quality: 2
User Experience: 3 - Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
Performance: 2 - Project pages load on average under 500 milliseconds.



### Attendance

* 06/18/2015 - Rick Bacci: All day, sick
* 07/29/2015 - Rick Bacci: All day, not feeling well

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### (Project Name

* [GitHub URL](https://RickBacci/exchange-a-gram)
* [Original Assignment]()
Github: Production: https://exchange-a-gram.herokuapp.com

We were asked to duplicate an app by accessing its api. I picked
Instagram.

I know Jorge told me that I had a controller that had too much logic in it.
I also had some wierd problems with my ui. It was the first project I ever used
haml, and I made some mistakes.

Server-Side Application and APIs: 2 - Project uses an external API, but
usage is scattered across the application OR its usage is not effectively tested.

Test-Driven Development: 2 - The code demonstrates high test coverage (>60%),
but does not adequately balance feature and unit tests.

Features: 3 - All planned features were delivered.

Interface: 2 - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result
is not effective.


#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/RickBacci/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rales_engine.markdown)

In this project, we'll use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API
which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.


Completion: 1 - Project fails more than 4 spec harness tests

Rails and ActiveRecord Style: 3 - Project makes good use of ActiveRecord to
fulfill Business Reqs, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods

Ruby Style and Code Quality: 2 - Project struggles to design useful Objects
or push logic down the stack

API Design: 3 - Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout,
while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features

Test Driven Design: 4 - Project has exceptional test coverage at various
application levels, including coverage for edge cases and complicated
logic methods


## Team

### Projects

I was a part of one team project.

#### Supper Skip

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/RickBacci/supper_skip)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/brettgrigsby/supper_skip)

Did a pivot off of a previous teams Dinner Dash. Multitenancy was learned by
turning a single restaurant into an app that could be used by multiple
restaurtant owners.

 I can remember Hoarace telling me that I focused a bit too much on
 integration tests. Also that I tore out a perfectly good state-machine and
 replaced it with pretty much the same thing with a different name.

Feature Completion - 2: Is missing some base features

Project Organization - 3: Team generally makes good use of git and project
workflow, but has a few "git dump" PRs or dropped tickets

Test-Driven Development - 3: Solid test coverage. Slightly heavier reliance
on one layer over another, and some gaps, but important features are
generally well-covered.

Code Quality - 3: Solid code quality. A few small leaks of responsibility,
but logic is pushed down the stack and generally clearly encapsulated.

User Experience - 2: Some gaps in the UX

* I enjoyed working with this team. We all trusted each other, and made quick
decisions and moved forward. Understanding the code base of a project that you
never worked on is tough, but i'm sure its the norm in programming.


Had feedback that that I am a hard worker and dedicated,and that I bring a
unique perspective and always take the time to help my peers, and share things
that I have learned.

## Community

I do my best to help anyone that asks. I have paired on a few occasions with
other students that have asked. I share things that I learn. On the side i've
began to set up the RaspberryPi that Jeff bought to enable us to send prints
wirelessly to the printer. I did one student led session for 'ruby warrior'.
I also helped one of my peers set up a blog with jeckyl.

### Giving Feedback

I gave feedback to all of my peers that requested it thru dm's.

### Playing a Part

I try to pass on what I know to others. Helping others feels good especially
when I'm stuck on something.

## Review

### Notes

* Personal / Technical growth curve not keeping pace as desired
* Seemed to start at a high point especially for technical skills, but not advancing as fast as others
* Major issues seem to stem from personal and project management
* Need more techniques to manage distraction and focus
* Earlier modules depended more on tech skill and determination - very suited to Ricky's strengths
* Now need to focus a lot on process, discipline, distraction, etc
* Need to develop skills and process for channeling raw power and aptitude into a disciplined project

### Outcome

* __A: End-of-Module Assessment:__ 1
* __B: Individual Work & Projects:__ 2
* __C: Group Work and Projects:__ 3
* __D: Community Participation:__ 3
* __E: Peer & Instructor Feedback:__ 3
