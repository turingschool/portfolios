## Individual
​
### Areas of Emphasis

My areas of emphasis was definitely JavaScript. I felt like after game-time, I definitely felt like I was in a good
place with JavaScript. And also, continue the job hunt.

* [Github URL](https://github.com/Justin-Holmes/goober)
* [Original Assessment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/goober.markdown)
​
* Satisfactory Progress: 3
* Ruby Syntax & Style: 4
* Rails Style & API: 3
* Testing: 3
* User Interface: 3
* Javascript (if applicable) N/A
​
Notes:
* 2 tables r cool -- handled routing and creation of these well
* good use of small helper ruby objects for managing pricing and status updating
* ^ in combo with good unit testing on these components
* admin stuff works well and is cool; having existing PORO things for updating and calculating price gives us a good
place to hook this logic in
​
### Attendance
​
I attended all classes, but I had to miss snippets of class in order do phone/code interviews.
​
### Work
​
I completed the following individual work this module:
​
#### Idea Box

* Ruby Style: 4
* JS Style: 4
​
Notes:

way you handled the thumbs up/thumbs down with a get/remote: true ... so clever.
​
#### JS Linked List

## Team
​
### Projects
​
I participated in the following team project:
​
#### Game Time
​
Reviewer: Horace Williams
​
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Justin-Holmes/Tron)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)
​
This project was to learn how to build a game that is playable in the browser.
​
* Functional Expectations: 4
* TDD: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental JS & JS Style: 3
* Code Sanitation (JSHint): 3
​
Notes:
* Game is sweet; awesome interface and playability
* testing is thorough and incremental
* Game rendering could be more isolated from play / data logic (imagine 2 phases -- move, then render)
* some opportunities to use JS objects as maps to clean up some branching and looping complexity
​
#### Flack
​
Reviewer: Horace Williams
​
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/morganmiller/flack)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Justin-Holmes/flack-node)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flack.markdown)
​
* Services - 4
* Encapsulation 3
* Rails MVC - 3
* TDD - 3
* Concept - 2 - mostly just vanilla chat app at this point
* Deployment - 2 - attempted to deploy on heroku but hit some snags with node side
* Features - 3 - multi channel, auth
* Technical learning / experimentation - 4 -- lots of node and react usage
* Project Management - 3
​
Notes:
* Great exploration of some interesting SOA and use of React for some front-end management. Didn't get far into the
product / concept aspects of the project, but it seems like we got some interesting technical learning along the way.

* Glad to see we got a lot of practice with JS both on the server and the client side. Major bonus points for the React
frontend. Sounds like Margarett got pretty close to a working implementation of a canvas / live-drawing system,
but just didn't quite get it put together at the end.
​
## Community
​
### Giving Feedback
​
From others:
* I think Justin  was my favorite teammate for group project throughout the course of Turing. He was the first person
I paired with in module 1, and we’ve been on 2 group projects together since. He’s quick at solving problems, reliable,
and I aways feel like we make a lot of progress when we work together - the team he ends up on will be lucky to have
him.
​
### Playing a Part
​
* On a regular basis, I would ask people if they needed help and would assist if they did. There are also countless
times when people would come and ask for help, and I would still help regardless if I was knee deep in my stuff(because
I'm really nice like that).
* I did my lightning talk on Elon Musk.
* Went to the 1508 happy hour.
​
## Review
​
### Notes

* Your cohort gave you a lot of shit and you took it well.
* You did what we asked you to do well. Were consistently on high functioning teams.
* We missed a little bit of potential in pushing you out of your comfort zone.

### Outcome
​
## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 4: Student demonstrates excellent growth by not only achieving satisfactory
evaluations for each project but also pushing their learning beyond expectations.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.


* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.


* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
