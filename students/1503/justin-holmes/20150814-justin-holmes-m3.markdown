# Justin Holmes - M3 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

My main area of focus was to get better at Rails.  While I felt ok with it by
the end of M2, I still wanted to strive for mastery and demonstrate best
practices.  I also used this module (and the break before starting) to get
my feet wet with javascript and slowly start to become more comfortable with
using it.

### Attendance

I have not missed a day during M3, or have been tardy. I will miss a day on
Friday, Aug. 14th for a wedding.

In this three-day project I implemented a Twitter emulator using the Twitter API. It was evaluated by Mike Dao with the following results:

Notes: 92.38 percent test coverage missing some test coverage,
namely logout, favorite, user exists. Good stub to test logging in.
No user model test, though most of that functionality is covered in
the login test.

## Community

### Feedback For Me

You were great to work with on Supper Skip! I found you to be very collaborative, high contribution, and great accountability, there was no doubt you wouldn't work on/complete what you said you would.

Justin is a super nice dude who always brigthens the atmosphere of a group. Also he is certainly in the top tier of developers within our cohort, and always willing to help with a code problem. Gold stars all around.

I haven't worked with Justin on a group project, but he's seriously super smart. Everytime I look over at him in class he appears to be spacing out, but he is somehow absorbing everything. He's always willing to help out whenever a classmate has a problem and doesn't quit until the problem is solved. He's also a critical mind and fantastic problem solver.
