# Sally MacNicholas - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module, I wanted to learn enough Javascript to be able to
continue to learn more on my own once I'm finished with the program. Though I still don't like JS,
I certainly feel more comfortable with it than I expected I would. I also
feel more comfortable with Clojure, which is an added bonus. I wanted to become
more proficient with vim. I think Horace can now maybe tolerate watching me type
in vim, and that's a win. Most importantly, I wanted to get a job and I did, so that's pretty cool.

Per Horace, I am supposed to write about what my favorite class was and why. I don't have a favorite class, but I will
say that my favorite TYPE of class was when we had a mixture of code alongs and
individual example work time.

### End of Module Assessment

* [Github URL](https://github.com/sallymacnicholas/goober)
* [Original Assessment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/goober.markdown)

* Satisfactory Progress: 3
* Ruby Syntax & Style: 3
* Rails Style & API: 4
* Testing: 3
* User Interface: 4
* Javascript (if applicable) N/A

Notes:
* Great RESTful routing  -- separating driver / rider paths on top
  of single table
* good use of controller filters and helpers to structure the
  auth and request logic
* Testing is solid at integration and model level; keep making sure
  that we're really covering the core logic in our model tests
* Like use of RideDetails class to handle mapping / eta

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of
a few absences for interviews, and doctors appointments.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Idea Box

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team project:

#### Game Time

Reviewer: Horace Williams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sallymacnicholas/game_time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

This project was to learn how to build a game that is playable in the browser.

* Functional Expectations: 4
* TDD: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental JS & JS Style: 3
* Code Sanitation (JSHint): 3

Notes:
* UI is awesome and colorful; animations and user feedback are very helpful; some
  of them could be sped up a tad
* Feature set is good; game feels complete, can play different cards, etc
* Testing is pretty solid and thorough at covering different game scenarios
* Testing could eventually get pruned a bit, but we're starting from a good
  position of covering the scenarios, so that is good
* Game structure takes a solid OO approach
* Some opportunities remain for refactoring and reducing duplication
* Keep working on pushing Jquery out of the main game logic

#### Flack

Reviewer: Horace Williams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brettgrigsby/Clojure-Flack)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flack.markdown)

* Features - 2
* Interface - 3
* Project Management - 3
* Code quality - 3
* Style / Use of ecosystem and libraries - 4
* Language experimentation / technical learning - 4
* Deployment - 4 - got it on heroku
* TDD - 2

Notes:
* Great job working through a fairly complicated project in a
  new language and environment. Appreciate your hard work
  experimenting with a lot of technical unknowns.
* Use of clojurescript and websocket connections is pretty idiomatic,
  and you did a good job of working with reagent to construct the frontend.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

From others:
* Sally seriously kicks ass. I'm super jealous that she got a job so early in
  the module and I know she's gonna crush it. She is always willing to help out
  and never afraid to ask questions when she's stuck on something. I'm
  incredibly glad I got to be a part of 1503 with her and I can't wait to see
  what she accomplishes in the coming years.
* Great to work with, wonderful personality
* She's almost perfect.

### Playing a Part

* Attended Clojure Den, and other meetups to support speakers from Turing
* Told everyone I met at meetups that they should apply to Turing (legit, people
  kept thinking I was a Turing recruiter)
* Denver Startup Week coding school panel
* Volunteering with young entrepreneur (not til after school is done but I
  commited to it during this module, so that counts right?)

## Review

### Notes

* End of module assessment went well. Enjoyed seeing the progress made of the last 6 months. 
* IdeaBox - Didn't finish all features. 
* GameTime was better. Felt like there was improvemenet in JavaScript
* Clojure!!! Liked doing it. Felt like she got a lot of out it in regrads to functional programming.
* Always cut scope - not quality. 

### Outcome

* Assessment: 4
* Individual: 3
* Group: 3
* Community: 4
* Feedback: 4
