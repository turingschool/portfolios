Whitney Hiemstra - Module 3 Portfolio
### Individual

## Areas of Emphasis

With previous individual projects, I have always had a very hard time with my project management skills.
I was constantly biting off more than I can chew, if I came across an issue I couldn't solve, I thought
"putting it on hold for now, focus on something else, get that done, and then come back" was a better
solution. I felt if I could at least get this other thing done, I would feel better about the project,
but it always came back to the issue I pushed aside, but now it wasn't a single issue to resolve, it had
more piled on it/around it, which made things more difficult to work through and understand, which led to
frustration and tears... I am now REALLY focused on using the tools that have been given to me, truly
using and keeping an organized waffle page; NOT going down a path blindly, don't make random guesses and
see if it works, make educated guesses; work through a single issue and STOP bouncing around; and setting
deadlines. The check-ins we have with instructors are helpful and keep me accountable and on track, but I
have used a calendar to set those personal deadlines. For group projects, we have always set up a private
Slack channel to keep the entire group in the loop and on track with what to accomplish/be accountable for.

I really want to get better at public speaking. I had originally opted to do the video blog for my
lightning talk, but realized in order to get better and get rid of that fear, is to do it more. So
I decided to actually give my lightning talk the following week. So happy I did as felt a lot better
and a lot more comfortable with speaking.

## End of Module Assessment

My end of module, personal project was assessed by Jorge and Horace. Results:

Jorge voiced that he felt the technical complexity of my project was great, but unfortunately there's no
real place in the rubric to record that.

# Feature Delivery
* Completion - 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.
* Organization - 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.

# Technical Quality
* Test-Driven Development - 4 !!!!
* Code Quality - 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

# Product Experience
* User Experience - 2: Project exhibits some gaps in the UX.
* Performance - 2: Project pages load on average under 500 milliseconds.


## Projects

I completed the following individual project for this module:

# APIcurious

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/whithub/mini_twitter)
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown)

* Server-Side Application and APIs: 3 - Project wraps/isolates external API but has some gaps or external connections in its testing.
* Test-Driven Development: 2.5 - The code demonstrates high test coverage (>70%). Needs more user tests.
* Features: 2.5 - Some features were sacrificed to meet the deadline.
* Interface: 3 - The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

So I don't necessarily agree with this grading. I try to be very big on TDD, but we
learned how to properly test external API's the afternoon before project was due. Also, I was
assigned the project by Jorge, who did set expectations and told the group what he's looking for
from us, but let us figure out and determine what we wanted to display on the pages; as long as
were parsing as much as we can. However, when I went into grading, by Mike, he pulled up a
rubric that wasn't given to us and, I was told later, was an old rubric. And so I felt I was dinged
for not displaying/parsing some features, but I didn't know these specific features were going to be
looked for. I parsed other features that were not on the list, but didn't appear to be factored in.

### Team Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

Supper Skip

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/adfink/supper_skip)
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/supper_skip.markdown)

This two week long project utilized a 1406 Dinner Dash project that had to scale from an ordering site
for a single restaurant into a platform allowing individual restaurants to sell food online. We had to
adapt the existing data model to flexibly serve multiple tenants.


* Feature Completion - 4
* Project Organization - 4
* Test-Driven Development - 4
* Code Quality - 3
* User Experience - 2

# Takeaway

* Inheriting code can be very challenging, but is what real life programming will be like and it
motivates me to write good, readable code to begin with.
* Scalability is tricky, but super interesting.
* I need to voice my concerns or questions more. - I felt my group was very collaborative, but there were
times when I would voice a concern about how we were approaching a problem, or how I felt doing 'this'
might solve or get us closer to solving, the task, but I wasn't necessarily heard. And then, of course,
comes the moment when someone else in the group mentions how we might go about solving the task and
it's exactly what I said. So I need to get better at explaining myself with both how and why I feel we
should go down this path...
* My group and I were great about discussing what we wanted to get out of the project. Aside from
learning and implementing what we've learned in class, I wanted to work on front-end styling a bit
more than what I have on past projects. My team mates we're happy to let me work on that. =)


### Giving Feedback

According to the Feedback application:

1) Am I easy to communicate with?
No
Rarely
Sometimes
Often
Always - 100%

People found me to be very approachable and easy to communicate.


2) How would you describe my contributions to groups and teams?
 Were you on my team?
 At least you tried
 You pitched in here and there
 You pulled your weight - 100%

Previous teams members felt I pull my own weight in group projects


3) How would you describe my work ethic?
 Lazy
 Inconsistent
 Average
 Strong
 Highly motivated and consistent - 100%

 Classmates and previous group members feel I'm consistent, highly motivated,
 and accountable for my work.

 How open am I to feedback?
  I'm afraid to give you any
  You take constructive criticism pretty hard
  You seem to take feedback well, but don't use it.
  You seem very open to it and would try & implement the advice. - 100%

People have said I am/appear to be very open to feedback, I take it well, and
try to implement that for future projects.

I also asked an open ended question:
What are areas I can improve on? What's something you'd wish I done, or done more?


* "I didn't have a chance to work with you directly on any projects, so I'm afraid I don't have a ton to go on here, but I'd say maybe don't be afraid to turn to classmates with questions if you have any. I don't notice you doing that a ton, but it's possible that's because you're a code rockstar! Otherwise, keep up the awesome work!" - anonymous through peer review survey (But I think it was Max Tedford

I definitely feel I can do this more. I have mostly gone to mentors and/or the same 6 classmates.
So even though I've met a variety of mentors on a weekly basis, I should reach out to more
people b/c (A) I can gain from learning from different people - different perspectives,
different ways of approaching a problem and (2) Networking!


* "Is always helpful and delightful, has a smile on her face, and is always willing to answer questions" - Margarett

* "Whitney is always very attentive during lessons, and seeks a deeper understanding of every concept by trying things out for herself, even when not required. She has a solid grasp on the fundamentals and understands many of the advanced concepts as well. She would be an asset to any team during a project." - anonymous through peer review survey

* "I don't know if there is anything to improve on. I think you are a really motivated student, and a hard-worker. I haven't been able to work in a group with you, but I think you would be a great team player. I appreciate that you are so open to help, when asked." - anonymous through peer review survey

### Playing a Part

Throughout the six weeks I've attended both the Denver.rb and Boulder Ruby meet ups. I've pushed myself
get out into the community more, though will work towards pairing with different people. I am currently
signed up to do the Pebble Rocks Boulder Hackathon and plan to go to the Rocky Mountain Ruby; both
taking place in September.

Like I said above, I feel super happy I'm working towards improving my public speaking. I plan to do
multiple lightning talks next module. I didn't have my lightning talk this module until week 5, and
didn't realize how much I actually enjoyed it. I looked at my lightning talk as something to dread,
and fear, but after seeing how much I enjoyed it, I would have liked to have done more of them. So
the plan is to do more than whats required for next module!

I've helped with organizing, paying for, and picking up breakfast on several Fridays.

I'm eager to get into the working world for several reasons, but a main one is to have actual time
to explore interests, learn more, and feed my curiosity about things. There are a lot of things
we'll dabble in, in class, or while looking one thing up for school, I come across something else
that's interesting and I always really want to explore and play with it, but I feel there's just
no time to do that. The 70-80 hour weeks can leave very little room to explore interests that
don't necessarily contribute to the project I'm working on.
