# Whitney Hiemstra - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module, I wanted to learn enough Javascript to be able to
continue to learn more on my own once I'm finished with the program. I ended up
really enjoying JS, but it got away from me towards the end of the module. I think
after acquiring the position at CaptainU, and Horace offering the two mini rails
projects, I got into Rails mode and wanted to nail down some serious rails concepts.
Repetition is how I learn best, so given the chance to play with Rails, make several
projects back to back, I feel pretty confident, which is a first time since starting
Turing. =) I did really enjoy JS though, I thought the Game Time project was awesome,
I'll definitely take some time off, but would like to go back to one/more of my
several rails projects and implement more JS into them...

Getting the CaptainU job is amazing! After speaking with mentors/alumni, I received
some great advice saying, "Either focus on finding a job, or focus on learning, but
if you try to do both, you'll end up doing both half ass." So I felt, "Well, I'm
paying Turing, might as well learn," so I decided to learn and gain as much as I
could this module and focus on job search after... I lucked out!

Apparently, I'm suppose to mention my favorite class... I don't have one that jumps
to mind, but I did like it when we had a balance btwn class time in morning and
work time in the afternoon.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Idea Box

Reviewer: Max Tedford

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/whithub/idea_box_2.0)
* [Original Assessment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

* Features: 3
* User Interface: 4
* Testing: 4
* Rails Style: 4
* Ruby Style: 3
* JS Style: 3

Notes:
* Liked that you used FactoryGirl for tests. Liked that you did the form
 validation with the alert Liked that you specified the title and body for
 the keyup filter
* Would have been nice to figure out respond_with rather than respond_to
Index action creates an @ideas variable AND an @idea variable


#### JS Linked List

Reviewer: Morgan Miller

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sallymacnicholas/js_linked_list)

* Functional expectations: 2
* TDD: 3
* Encapsulation: 3
* JS Fundamentals: 2
* Looping: 3


#### Scale Up

Reviewer: Horace

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/whithub/keevah.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)

* Production Deployment & Performance Monitoring: 3
* Load Testing / User Scripting: 4
* Database Load: yes
* Optimization Techniques: 3
* Features - Pagination yes

Notes:

* Good results - response time is snappy and throughput is solid
good mix of caching and DB optimization; pagination saves us on index pages
* Like seeing use of the cache within models and controllers as well
as in the views; next step is to keep thinking critically about how these
different caches are getting layered or nested



#### Practice Assessment

Reviewer: Horace

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/whithub/reading_list)
* [Original Assignment](https://gist.github.com/worace/0fa8052bfcf983e8722d)

* Progress: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Rails Style: 3
* JS: 2
* Testing: 4
* UI: 2


#### Pairr Programming

Reviewer: Horace

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/whithub/pairr_programming)

* Progress: 4
* Ruby Style: 3
* Rails: 3
* Testing: 3

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team project:

#### Game Time w/ Sally MacNicholas

Reviewer: Horace

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sallymacnicholas/game_time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

This project was to learn how to build a game that is playable in the browser.

* Functional Expectations: 4
* TDD: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental JS & JS Style: 3
* Code Sanitation (JSHint): 3

Notes:
* UI is awesome and colorful; animations and user feedback are very helpful; some
  of them could be sped up a tad
* Feature set is good; game feels complete, can play different cards, etc
* Testing is pretty solid and thorough at covering different game scenarios
* Testing could eventually get pruned a bit, but we're starting from a good
  position of covering the scenarios, so that is good
* Game structure takes a solid OO approach
* Some opportunities remain for refactoring and reducing duplication
* Keep working on pushing Jquery out of the main game logic



## Community

### Playing a Part

* I'll be real, I didn't do as much as I thought or really hoped I'd do this
module. I wanted to be a diligent note taker/resource for my classmates, but
felt all over the place this module. I was hoping to do more lightning talks
to get better at speaking, which I still have a huge interest in, but unfortunately,
time was not my friend this module; my lightning talk is tomorrow and I haven't
really started... It was definitely very frustrating this module to see it though...
I felt like I finally got into a grove with projects and work flow, got extremely
interested in side features, but there seemed to be no time for any of it.
I did attend a few meetups to support Turing student/grads who were speaking,
but I just couldn't juggle school work, job hunt, wedding, and health.


## Review

### Notes

* We would like to have had more Whitney, but understandable.
* Choices made for your learning were right. 


### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
