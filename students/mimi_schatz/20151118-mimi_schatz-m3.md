#### Feedback from Adam:

*GOOD*: Mimi is do doubt a strong personality. Which is good on team projects. I can really see her taking on a leader ship role and helping drive progress. She is also a super quick learner! I was impressed on a couple occasions that she had already gained such an in-depth understanding of new material. Very nice to have on a team. Also, Mimi definitely has better balance that I do. She would set a goal to be done by a certain time and then live up to it. This was nice to have as well as I am totally the opposite and will stare at a cursor for a good 15 minutes thinking. Overall, Mimi is super strong, and a definite leader.
*BAD*: I sometimes felt that Mimi was a bit hard to communicate with. it was almost as if she wanted to make the decision/decide the verdict, but wouldn’t actually do so. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. To provide context, I was acting as team lead, but I certainly felt as if Mimi should have been Team lead based on her skill-set. She had a hard time NOT being a leader. ​
*CONCLUSION*: I 100% endorse Mimi as a strong developer that will crush it in the real world.She has good instinct and is way more brave behind the keyboard than most developers at Turing. I would like to work with her again!

## API Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mcschatz/chatterboxes)
* [Production](http://chatterboxes.herokuapp.com)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown)

In this project, we were asked to consume and work with data from a public API. I chose a popular website, Twitter for this project, and re-constructed a simplified version of the website's existing UI using their own API.

#### Assessed By: Jorge

#### Scores:

* Completion: 4: Developer delivered all planned features plus 2 extensions.
* Organization: 1: Developer failed to use a project management tool to track its progress.
* Test-Driven Development: 3: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>80%), tests at feature and unit levels, but relies on external services.
* Code Quality: 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
* User Experience: 2: The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective.

## Rales Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mcschatz/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

In this project, I used Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API to expose data from a previous project, SalesEngine.

#### Assessed By: Jorge

#### Scores:

* Completion: 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.
* Test-Driven Development: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
* Code Quality: 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
* API Design: 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.
* Queries: 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.
Rales Engine was a short solo-project in which we built an API and made
conjectures about the data it provided by making smart use of advanced Active
Record queries. In addition to working on building the API, I made an effort to
use as little Ruby as possible to complete the business logic. I also spent some
time in the PostgreSQL console practicing raw SQL.

## ExitRunner

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Schoolrunner/tssd-1507-c)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

Schoolrunner proposed a project to help teachers quickly move data from one app, ExitTicket, into their app, Schoolrunner. We built an app to parse, reformat, and submit data to Schoolrunner's assessment endpoint.
