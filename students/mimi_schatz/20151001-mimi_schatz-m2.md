#### Notes

* Got testing with Selenium working - very cool
* Site looks great.
* Implemented Stripe and Twilio as extensions

* Views: 3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through
* Controllers: 4: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack
* Models: 3: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring
* Testing: 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels
* Usability: 4: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers
* Workflow: 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

#### Feedback from Travis

"Mimi is an industrious and extremely capable team member. Her ability for deciphering and picking apart complicated problems was a major asset on our team. Specifically, she is a refactoring guru and did wonders with some functional but very questionable methods I code vommitted into a create method in one of our controllers. She was very flexible over the course of the project and also very diligent with her workflow and being a team player when trying to resolve conflict within the group. I donâ€™t really have any areas for improvement for Mimi, I think she is well rounded and very capable. I would love to work on a project with Mimi again."

#### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Attended Rocky Mountain Ruby Conference.
* Took over as co-organizer of Women Who Code Ruby Study Group at Turing.
* Helped 1508 students with Chisel and Enigma.
* Became a student representative for 1507.
