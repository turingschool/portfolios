## Areas of Emphasis
What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

As a volunteered repeater I knew I'd still find challenges being that logic problem solving is not my strong suit, but as of now I feel as though I continue to succeed and grow in this area. I acknowledge my growth in the basic fundementals of ruby, oop, and overall my coding skill. As always there is still plenty of room for improvement. I know as my time here at Turing goes on I will continue to strengthen areas I lack in such as logic or simply not to over think porblems. Overall, my aspirations have and still continue to grow and become a reality.
I would say my struggle was and stil is logic in combination that, for the most part, I over complicate what is potentially something simple. However, looking back in retrospec I can definitely say I've improved in this area a lot, minus a few hickups here and there and with the help I've received from pairing with others, I learned how to take a step back and take things step by step and work my way through most problems without help.

## Projects
What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
What did you learn from your independent projects?
What did you learn from your paired projects?

I enjoyed working on every project especially Black Thursday now that I have a clear understanding of it! We incorporated everything we've learned and combined it with newer concepts which became fun challenges as we coded along. 
I learned to continue to use my resources around me, to continue to seek help and ask lots questions. 
Throughout the paired projects I learn how to work together and incorporate/blend my work ethic and working styles with those of my partners. I learned to change my pace and delegate responsibilities effectively. I also learned that teaching others is a great way to practice what you've already learned, stay updated and retain what you learned in the past so you don't forget the things you've already learned. 


## Community
What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
What would you like to do to contribute next module?

My favorite gear up is still the Introversion vs. Extroversion. Its fun seeing what everyone's result are, especially after you get to know them. I've paired with a few of my classmates quite a few times and held a few group studies. Towards the begginning of this mod I was also able to pair with a few mod 2 students thanks to the experience I already had from my mod 2 experience. And as always I kept myself open and available for any questions or pairing whether they took a minute or an hour.
