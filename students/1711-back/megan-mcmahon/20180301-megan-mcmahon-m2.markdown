## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

* In this mod, I really wanted to stay ahead of the rush of information so that I didn't ever feel like I was trying to catch up.  I also wanted to complete all projects at a satisfactory level.  I think I was 80% successful in these tasks.  In terms of the information that was presented and needed to complete the projects I was able to stay current and not fall behind; however, I do feel that I have a lot still to learn about Active Record and SQL.  In addition, I feel like redoing the bike-shop portion of bike share during intermission will help solidify the cart/order process for me.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

* I struggled most with UX and styling!  It was very difficult for me to figure out when the styling was 'done' and when I should just stop because I was not making improvements, but making things worse.  It is also difficult for me to focus on the correct things - I need to think about prioritizing some UX over minor style issues.  I did learn through this struggle, that if I am struggling, there are probably tools that have helped other backenders through this struggle and I can use them! (instead of just brute forcing my way through it).

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

* My favorite projects were Bike Share and Idea Box because these were projects that I could see including in a portfolio (after some cleanup).

* I really enjoyed all of the projects in the mod - I think that they all accomplished specific and non-repetitive learning goals.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

* I learned that I need to start paying attention to well-designed websites and start thinking about how to incorporate some of those design principles in my own projects!

What did you learn from your paired projects?

* I learned how great rebasing can be!  The learning curve is steep, but once we got it going, it really helped with cleaning up merge conflicts.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

* I did not particularly enjoy any of the gear ups this mod.  I felt that the first two were very repetitive and focused on extremely similar issues (getting more underrepresented people into tech roles).  While this is a very important topic that should be discussed - more variety in the gearups might be nice.  If we want to continue with the current theme of gearups, one that I would be super interested in would be how to make change in STEM demographics at the kindergarten (or earlier) level.  It would also be nice if the discussion led to some actionable item - like the mod decides on an outreach program to get involved with as a group.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

* SAB!

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

* I will continue with SAB and would like to get more involved with JCS
