# Matt Milton - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

* My primary goals were to learn a lot of sql/activerecord, not get in a car accident - like I did during Black Thursday-, care about design but not let it consume me, index my notes and share one of my projects at a code fair. After sharing my rails mini-project at a code fair, I felt a sense of accomplishment unique at Turing. It was great to hear front-end students compliment my styling and javascript carousel. I was quite successful at all of these goals except indexing my notes. I intend to do it over the break week.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

* I think I struggled with time management during my group projects and communicating issues as they arose during these projects. This is something that I will work on and I hope to get the most of next module by being more adaptable and not sweating the small stuff. Simultaneously I need to be more recipriocal with my interactions with instructors. If they give me 15 minutes of their time, I better put 45 minutes of time making sure I understan what they communicated.

## Blog

Link your blog post here. Include a short description of your topic (one sentence is fine).

* I made a bunch of graphs and classified Big O [equations](https://github.com/mgmilton/big_o_blog/blob/master/README.md).

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

* By far, my favorite project the rails mini project Idea Box. It allowed me to practice authorization and authentication as well as implementing full CRUD functionality. Since I could work independently, I paced the project so that I advanced quickly with enough time to learn about the collection select form helper and how to use it with images. Additionally, I got to throw in some assets like a carousel and dynamic drop down in my navigation bar. Bike Share was also a behemoth of a project that confused the snot out of me. It was wonderful to learn from my fellow students and implement a map even though it was not requested. I suppose my least favorite was Little Shop Redux because its hard to envision the purpose of a store without a cart.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

* Authorization, authentication, CRUD Functionality, HTTP protocol, RESTFul Architecture, and the MVC architecture.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

* The importance of clear, concise instructions when managing a project and placing user stories verbatim in the waffle.io. As for technical things, I learned about the implementation of a session through a cart. I learned about parsing databases, making maps through MapBox's API, and how crucial it is to not have a typo in your seed file.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

* My favorite gear up was learning about the gender imbalance in the computer software industry. It was great to learn about Lord Byron's daugher Ada Lovelace and her role in conceptualizing a computer. It was great to learn about Grace Hopper and the neologism she offered the computer science community. I liked that documentary so much I did a little dive on the history and here's what I found:

* Although I learned a considerable amount about the pro's and con's of diversity quotas, I felt like the discussion of blue vs yellow people was a little lacking. On one hand, it helped visualize the problem yet the larger group discussion unnerved me. A student articulated something about the cause of us being biased against other races resides in our genetics. I cringed when I heard that. Not only is it factually incorrect, but it also misreprensents a scientific field to reify biases. Phrenology and eugenics have done similar things. I brought up the example of Ashkenazi Judiasm and the high rates of genetic disorders within this community. As time has progressed, more indivuals have begun wedding non Jewish indiviudals and having kids. Perahps, this is the population responding?

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
* I tutored some students in 1801 BE module. I attended a denhac meet-up with some alumni. I cleaned the kitchen more than I wanted to and during the intermission week I invited our module over to my house where I cooked for them.

* If you're curious, I made them miso-marinaded tuna steaks, a ginger cashew butternut squash soup and a roasted beet salad. During this cookout I also invited Simpson St. Fort who I met at the new student meet-up to assist him in his pre-work. We helped him get atom installed on his computer and gave him a tour of terminal commands. We also all went on a hike to a lookout point where an unobstructed view.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

* Give a lightning talk in Clark Hall perhaps on Big O Notation, encourage students to write recommendations for other students on LinkedIN, and I plan on hosting another get together during the upcoming intermission week. My intention is a host poker night next Friday assuming I get all the intermission work completed.
