### What was your biggest achievement of the module?
For Mod 4, my goals were:
* Demo my capstone. Merge my old world with my new world.
* Write two additional blog posts for my personal website
* Give a lightening talk @Turing Top Talks that I am proud to share on video
* Start becoming “job ready” by practicing code and interviewing questions, networking and applying for jobs
* Win GoCode Colorado

I have achieved all of these (except the last one, but I will find out tonight!)

I'm all about connecting the dots (both in my life and in the Dots game). The reason I got into tech was that I loved the field I was in but didn't feel like I was solving its problems fast or efficiently enough. I set out to do a capstone project that was environmentally health related and ideally working with a client. I reached out to my network of EH colleagues and contacts, and an acquaintance from the Colorado Dept. of Public Health & Environment responded with an awesome oppourtunity to work on a prototype for a real grant they were applying to for food satefy. I jumped at this opportunity and had about 3 meetings with them throughout the mod to figure out exactly what they wanted. I'm really proud of my capstone, and even though I have a lot to still complete, I'm excited at the chance to present the problem and how my app can help the problem at Demo night and thus, connect my old Environmental Health world with software development.

I also wrote two additional blog posts to add to my personal website ellencornelius.com. One was the Part 2 of my ActiveRecord blog post, the other was on PostGIS.

I really worked on my lightening talk before the @Turing Top Talks to get more practice downloading shapefiles and converting them into apps. I have not seent the video yet, but I was proud of the talk I gave and think I will be able to share parts or all of it on my website. 

To get "job-ready," I started practicing Exercisms weekly. I also applied to 6 jobs and through meeting and reaching out to people was able to get them directly to HR. I am currently undergoing one interview process right now with a company. I also have been practicing telling my story and describing my process in working through a project. I have attended three meetups this Mod where I have met a few Ruby developers that I can reach out to and apply to jobs at their companies.

### What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

My biggest struggle was creating a separating front-end app, and connecting it to backend endpoints. It was my first time not using Rails to build a front-end, and so I had to figure out how to use Webpack and NPM/Yarn package managers on my own. I did this by going through Turing's lessons, Googling A LOT, and reaching out to my peers for help. It was a slow start, and if there's anything I've learned at Turing about process it's that when you're jumping into a new technology the start will be slow, so be patient and be consistent in working on it. I've been thinking a lot about what I've learned here, and honestly feel like the most important thing Turing has taught us is that we can figure it out. Like with using Django as a framework for my third backend - I don't really rememeber the exact syntax of Python and the steps in creating a Django app, but I know I can figure it out and that if I do it consistenly enough it will become second nature, like Rails. 

### What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

I finished strong and followed through. I never stopped participating in class, leanrning as much new material as I could, and staying motivated through the end. When I'm on a team, like GoCode, I do what I say I will do (refactoring seed file and reaching out to contacts).

I also excel in my ability to give and receive constructive feedback. 

For technical skills, I am really good at breaking a problem down into its smaller parts. Examples are the code challenges we had, and bigger problems like my capstone.

### How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

I think working in the front-end was really interesting and would like to pursue opportunities where I can work full-stack.

It reframed that there is still a ton of logic on the front end and how to manipulate the incoming data e.g. How I needed data with an id so I could make a new div,  and iterating over data arrays and objects. Definitely inspired me to keep working on JavaScript fundamentals after graduation and jQuery and manipulating the DOM.

I also gained a better understanding of what micro services are and how actual software applications are structured. 

Also, I realized yesterday again just how much of a process deployment is and dealing with unexpected bugs in production.

### What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

The best thing Turing gave me is faith in myself to solve problems and being okay facing the unknown. Did this in learnin gnew technologies like JavaScript, jQuery PostGIS.
