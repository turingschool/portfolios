## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

* Starting out at Turing, my only goal was to pass Mod 1. However, along the way I have been realizing that success is a lot more than just passing. Completing each project is important, but more importantly is how you do it. Taking the time to try to learn on your own through Stack Overflow, Ruby Docs, or other online resources is important before asking others. In partner projects, the way you code with your partner is much more important than completing it. Trying different pairing patterns, asking your partner to explain their logic fully until you understand, staying positive throughout the process and both being fully engaged and not letting yourself take a backseat are all things that will actually build your skills. You might not build your skills if your only goal is to get the project done. Also having your only focus be completion may discourage you from taking risks, such as trying to use tools you are not familiar with. For this reason, I did not start using GitHub until the final partner project because I was uncomfortable using it until I was forced to. I think I was successful in realizing my original goal was not what it should have been and making better goals for next module.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

* I struggled with a lot of things and wrote a list of them in my professional development reflection. However, if I have to come up with my main struggle it was dealing with stress and it's affects on me. I think stress played a large role in spilling over into my other struggles and exaggerating them. I think my takeaway is not taking myself as seriously. By doing this I hope to be more like my "best self" throughout Turing.
* Also, I really struggled with comparing myself to my classmates a lot (both I perceive as above and below me). I've learned that this is incredible waste of mental energy and only deteriorates my confidence. I started thinking about times I don't compare myself to others - like when I ran half-marathons in the past. I only was comparing my past self to my current self in theses races, and I think it's because there were thousands of people I was running against I didn't care who beat me and who didn't. It's actually the same situation in coding, although my perception is misleading because I am coding amongst such a small group of people, when really there are thousands (probably more...) people who are learning code like I am.
A suggestion I would have for Turing is to do a Gear Up session on this at the start of Mod 1, because I think a lot of people do compare themselves to others but don't admit to it.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

* Credit Check - 5
Jungle Beats - 4.5
Night Writer - 4
HTTP, Yeah You Know Me - 5
Black Thursday - 3

* My favorite project would have to be HTTP. I thought it was a great project that taught a new and useful concept (sending and receiving responses), and at the same time I got to practice creating an array of methods and classes, and incorporating DRY and SRP concepts. I also really liked Credit Check because the progression of creating a string of functions, then changing each function into a method, then creating a class around it was key in teaching me what methods and classes really are.
* My least favorite projects were Black Thursday and Night Writer. Black Thursday because it was really challenging to keep all the classes we had created straight and to actually conceptualize how they were all related. I also thought the spec was very unclear at times, especially in Iteration 4. I don't know that much about business, and I feel like a lot of the business intelligence methods we had to create could have been better explained as well as the BUSINESS reason behind them i.e. why they would be valuable. I think this the industry you are working in is something you need to learn about to be a better programmer.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

* I learned that I can learn most things if I just give myself enough time. The unfamiliarity of starting off projects is always a big hurtle for me, and trying to not let that scare me moving forward. I can get used to anything if I just give it enough time. Moving forward, I would like to work on cultivating more confidence in my technical skills (maybe that's means doing more practice on the side and delving more into extra pre-work before the module even begins).

What did you learn from your paired projects?

* During my paired projects, I learned that I am a better developer than I thought. I went into both partner projects thinking that my partner had superior coding skills and at first this inhibited me from saying my opinion or defending my methods. Throughout the both projects, I realized I actually had a lot of strengths to offer like attention to detail, strong logic skills, debugging using error messages and thinking about user-interface interactions in the real-world (big picture oriented). However, being more fully engaged in partner projects (i.e. navigating more), speaking up when I don't full understand something (or maybe accepting I just need to go home and work through it on my own), and communicating better (i.e. revisiting our DTR) are all things I would like to focus on improving on in Mod 2. Improving my teamwork and communication skills will be a big priority for me.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

* My favorite gear-up was the introvert/extrovert session. I thought this was the most insightful session in teaching me about other's differences from my own, and becoming more self-aware about my ambivert strengths and challenges.
* I also REALLY thought the developer identity gear up was extremely useful.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

* I stuck around in the evenings to be amongst the Turing community, even when I was working independently. This allowed me to get to know Mod 2 students as well as my classmates. I tried to help my classmates as much as my abilities allowed me to. I also attended Joan Clarke Society meetings each week to cultivate relationships with women in front-end and upper mods. I also really enjoyed participating in my posse each week and getting to know upper /front-end students.  

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

* I would really love to help Mod 1 students as much as I can, and serve as a mentor for those who are really struggling. I would also like to start attending the Palkha meetings on Friday. I would also like to speak up more in class and ask questions. I also think making tutorial videos would be cool.
