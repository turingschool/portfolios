## Areas of Emphasis

#### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

as a repeater, my goal was simple. i had failed once; i couldn't let that happen again. i entered the module with a focused and confident mind, having worked through several challenging projects over my break. i entered the more challenging class section on day one, ready for a challenge, and determined to be victorious this time. i do believe i was successful at accomplishing my goal this time. i certainly learned a lot, and am feeling more confident than ever in my coding abilities.

#### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

one of my biggest struggles this module was in paired projects. i put so much pressure on myself to be successful and i let that pressure get in my hrad a little. this led me to move more quickly than i should have through the first paired project and in a way, steal some learning from my partners. i do regret it if i did. another struggle for me was in staying motivated. in a way, i was able to be a little bit lazy at times because i was comfortable in what we were doing. this mindset will only hurt me moving forward in the other modules so i tried not to let myself succumt to it.

## Projects

#### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

even though i may have moved too quickly for my partners at times during this project, complete_me was definitely my favorite project. having to tackle something entirely new to me, tries and recursion, i forced myself to learn through the struggle. we made great headway in the first few days of the project and that enabled up to complete many extensions on the project, including a front end!

#### What did you learn from your independent projects?

from my independent projects i learned not to overestimate my own abilities and not to underestimate the project difficulty. i stared the http project later than i should have because i did just that and it led to me not getting as far into the project as i wanted to. another thing regarding this same project is to try not to let difficulties in your personal life interfere with your school life!

#### What did you learn from your paired projects?

from my paired projects i learned the value of being on a team with others, working to accomplish a large goal. for instance, in complete_me, especially towards the end of the project, we split up responsibilities between the three of us, allowing us to get so many extensions done. this for me takes a certain amount of trust that i don't always feel comfortable giving others involving code in a project i'm working on, however, i did learn the importance of giving others that trust. sometimes you just need to let go a little bit.

## Community

#### What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

my favorite gear up this module was probably the growth mindset session. i still really try to embrace the idea of "not yet." that idea is truly inspiring to me. with a growth mindset, nothing has to be off limits. you accomplish what you believe you can by growing constantly and embracing the fact that you will always have more to learn. incredible.
my least favorite gear up this module was the strengths and storytelling session. this one, to me, is just too black and white. the overall idea of getting better at telling your story i do agree is very important and could be crucial to the e=success one might find in a job search. however, the idea of drawing a life line regarding life events as either good or bad is the most closed mindset way of reflecting on your life that i can imagine. fundamentally, i can't stand this session and will be happy to not have to engage in it again.

#### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

i tried my best to be a very active member in the turing community this module. before the module began i was meeting with students and leading prework study groups. during the module as well, i engaged in students learning by leading study / review sessions fridays during lunch. i spent time with students and student groups through slack screenshare and google hangout and even traveled to classmates' homes some nights just to help them through a problem the were struggling with. as a repeater, i know what it's like to feel that stranded and that lost when you can't figure somethng out, and wanted to do my best to ensure my classmates could get the most learning they could this module.

#### What would you like to do to contribute next module?

next module i wuold like to give a lightning talk during a wrap up. there were not many back end lightning talks this module. i also would like to begin engaging with the queerqoder group more, and possibly take the reigns in the future once lola leaves. another thing i would like to do next moddule is begin attending the palka group and the beryllium group.
