## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

my main goal this module was to keep myself focused and maintain regular study habits to ensure i perform to my fullest potential. while i was successful to a certain extent, i did fully live up to my own expectations. there were times i let my personal issues in my own life get in my way and for a while i had lost sight of my goals almost entirely. my biggest reality check was in week four during the rails challenge. my performance was seriously lacking and i knew that at that point in the module it was make it or break it for me. i set out to make changes in my life to ensure my success in the module, and i stuck to those resolutions. after spending the extra time that i needed, which led to some late nights, it finally fell into place and clicked for me. i now feel very confident in some skills that just two weeks ago were over my head. during our final group project, i chose to tackle some of the final pieces i wasn't fully confident in, primarily authorization and cart building, and i now feel strong about my execution of those concepts.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

my biggest struggle this module was in building many to many database relationships. after struggling through the week four rails challenge i knew i needed to lock this in at any cost. learning the structure of this relationship took some extra time out of my nights, but it was crucial to my success in the following two rails challenges and to my ability to be a productive team member in the final project. my main take away from this struggle is to try to recognize earlier when something is out of my comprehension and to take that extra time to lock it in.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

my favorite project this module was definitely bike share. i really like working in groups to accomplish large projects because you get the opportunity to learn different approaches from your team members. the other reason i enjoyed bike share was that it implemented all the pieces of information we've been learning all module into one project, permitting a chance to refresh on more basic things and to gain more experience on some of the more complex components.

my least favorite project this module was idea box. this project didn't keep me as motivated as i needed to be, most likely because i had put off styling until the last day and was afraid to get into it. my main take away from this project is that it truly is important to style early and often.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

the independent projects in this module helped me understand the importance of time management. projects in rails can be very time consuming, even if you don't make any mistakes along the way. creating an agenda for each day can really help to keep you on track.

What did you learn from your paired pro
the paired projects this module helped me understand the importance of clear group communication. there were times in the group project where multiple team members had worked on the same implementation, which led to merge conflicts and more importantly, wasted time. setting a plan for each team member at the beginning and end of each day is an easy way to avoid this issue.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

my favorite gear up this module was the session led by the module four students. the session i attended was "introvert to influencer." this gear up to me was particularly valuable because it helped me to remember to be conscious of my body language and the way i can unconsciously present myself.

my least favorite gear up this module was the empathy and privilege session. this is a good session which addresses many important issues, but i had seen the video twice before so i was a little bored.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

this module i did my best to help module one students with issues whenever they asked, within reason. i also did my best to help classmates when they needed it as well. i tried to interact with as many turing students outside of my module as possible and i made several new friendships and connections in the community in the past six weeks.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

next module i'm really gonna give a lightning talk to the school. it's something i've been wanting to do but didn't make the time for. next module, i don't think i'll have a choice! i'm cool with that. next module i want to work with more front end students and try to learn some js here and there. i also will continue to reach out to lower module students and provide mentorship when possible.
