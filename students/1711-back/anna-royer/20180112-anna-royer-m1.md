## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

* When I started at Turing, I had already been teaching myself and playing with html, css, javascript, and a little ruby for several months. I was excited to start at Turing, and I pretty much set out to 'squeeze the juice' of being here. I wanted to expedite my learning process, build some projects I was excited about and proud of, and learn about and become comfortable with a lot of new tools. In general, I wanted to feel comfortable writing code and to at least start to feel like I could build real things.

* I think I was successful in many aspects. I learned lot of new things and improved a lot in what felt like a fairly short amount of time. There are certain things we learned this mod, that now feel like second nature to me to use, which is really cool. There are some things that I still don't feel comfortable with, or really don't understand, and I am concerned about that, because this program is constantly moving forward at a fast pace.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

* My biggest non-coding struggle was time management. More specifically, I struggled with knowing what to prioritize, because there are so many important things to learn and practice and I don't have time for all of them. I'm not sure I always made the most effective choices in where I spent my time and focus. I also made the mistake of not getting enough sleep at certain points. I need to be better about that in future modules, because it just makes everything more difficult.

* I also struggled to connect with other students. I would like to form stronger relationships with other students at Turing. I feel that I have not always been my best and kindest self during my time at Turing, partly because the work at Turing is pretty stressful.

* My biggest coding related struggle was probably learning how to use test driven development and to write programs methodically rather than haphazardly. I am still working on this, but I feel I am improving bit by bit. It was a struggle for me to start writing tests first, especially when I had no idea what I was doing. It was frustrating that testing slowed me down. However, http was made exponentially by my avoidance of testing; had I used test driven development, I could have gotten myself out of many problems much faster. I am slowly feeling more at ease knowing what to test and how to write good tests.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

* My favorite project was probably complete me, because the logic of solving it was so satisfying. It was also so exciting to load the csv file of all the Denver addresses and then search for an address and have it return all the matches just like google maps does. It felt like we created something useful and it was interesting to learn the intricacies of the data structure we used to make it work. I was also ecstatic when I figured out how to sort my binary search tree recursively in date night.

* I don't necessarily have a least favorite project. I realize that I learned something valuable from each project. Of all the projects I have seen to completion so far, http was the most frustrating for me to work on. There were so many new elements and concepts introduced at once that I had a much more difficult time debugging problems. I spent a long time trying to figure out why my get request loop was running twice, only to realize that chrome creates an additional request for a favicon. I spent close to three days thinking I was doing redirect incorrectly, and trying it a million and one different ways, to finally realize that my redirect headers needed to be capitalized.

I've developed a pretty basic but effective ability to use pry, minitest, google and ruby docs to debug problems in my projects. These tools did not always illuminate the problems in my http program and that was frustrating and a little scary. In retrospect, http was extremely valuable and honestly pretty cool. We built a web server and I have a much better understanding of the http request cycle and how the internet works in general.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

* gained some perspective and practice using (mostly) object oriented design
* recursion
* Important elements of ruby style
* File I/O
* testing

What did you learn from your paired projects?

* how to apply mocks and stubs
* applying fixtures
* how to DTR
* GIT / GITHUB
* practice communicating about code: I realized over time that I make a lot of assumptions of the person I am talking to when I talk about code. I learned how important it is to explicitly provide the context and details of my thought process while I am explaining it to another person.
* how to re - DTR

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

The gear up that stands out most prominently in my memory is the health and wellness gear up on self care strategies that combat stress and anxiety. This gear up followed up on the health and wellness gear up on the powerful impact of stress on physical health. She gave us a list of activities we can use when we feel overwhelmed with stress. They were mostly simple activities. The accessibility of all the activities was what made this list so valuable. Because of this session, I have gotten in the habit of going for a walk outside or if I am at home, doing something like taking a hot shower or making a healthy snack when I start to feel really overwhelmed. I believe these small actions have been instrumental in maintaining my mental health while at Turing.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I was given the opportunity to contribute to the Turing community through being a member of the Student Advisory Board. This allowed me to contribute my ideas and opinions to decisions about all-school events and decisions about making changes. As part of my role as an SAB rep, I led cohort retros on fridays and  made surveys for my cohort. I communicated my cohort's thoughts, concerns and ideas to the staff and communicated the staff's plans and expectations to my cohort. I wouldn't say I necessarily contributed to the community in this way, but I also attended a couple joan clarke society meetings to connect with other female students at Turing.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I am looking forward to being on the Student advisory board again next module. Now that I have a better understanding of the role of the student advisory board and am more comfortable with the responsibilities, I would like to make a bigger contribution to the student advisory board meetings and events. I would also like to be more proactive in making ideas come to fruition in this role next module. For example, this module, the SAB rep in front end module 1 and I discussed planning a get together between our cohorts during a cohort retro in which we could share what we are working on with one another and get to know each other better. We did not make this happen this module, but I would like to revisit the idea and make it happen next module.

I received a lot of help from students in upper modules throughout this module. Next module, I would love to be active in helping module 1 students with their work! (Now that I sort of know what I'm talking about). I would also like to become more involved in the joan clarke society.
