## Areas of Emphasis

> \<What did you set out to accomplish this module?>

* To be honest, I'm not sure I knew entirely what we were going to learn this module, so my expectations for myself were a bit more nebulous and less technical at the beginning.
* I knew building and consuming APIs were a major piece of the curriculum this module, and I wanted to become comfortable and well-versed in doing both.
* I wanted to become more involved in Pahlka and the Joan Clarke Society
* I felt very uncertain of my ability to come up with a personal project idea, plan the design, process and requirements and see myself through the completion of the project, but I was determined to accomplish it.
* I had heard students in modules above me say that they felt job-ready by the end of module 3, and that they hadn't until that point. I wanted to develop the skills necessary to get myself to where I felt I could be a professional developer.
* I wanted to begin narrowing down my job search and figure out the type of jobs I am most interested in and hone in on a plan to pursue those jobs.
* I wanted to become more involved in the tech community and attend more events.
* I had noticed myself developing a negative attitude in module 2 and I had stopped consistently taking care of my personal health, in terms of getting enough sleep and exercise, etc. I intended to make an effort to maintain a more positive attitude in module 3 and to make healthier choices for myself.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>

* The first 3 weeks of this module felt very doable, and having a couple weekends of was amazing.
* In those few weeks, I got really excited about joining Pahlka and working on a civic tech project as part of that student group.
* I also felt I had time to attend meetups and be involved in the community, as well as to explore areas of technology that interest me outside the curriculum.
* The last 3 weeks of the module were in many ways the hardest I've had at Turing, but I think I did gain a lot from that struggle.
* Unfortunately the last few weeks, I did not maintain the same balance I'd had in the first few weeks of the module.

>* \<Notes>

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* \<Description>

* Github "clone" of the github profile page with personal and repository information about the logged in user and news feed page with information about users and repositories the logged in user follows. It was built with Github OAuth and the github API.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>

* I really enjoyed this project. I liked that the focus was on the object oriented design aspect of consuming an API, because that is something I was really excited to learn and practice this module. I felt it was a good entryway into learning to design the process of how to consume an API on the server side of an application. I also liked that we didn't have to come up with a visual design ourselves, but instead could copy Github.
* I did feel the project requirements were very open-ended, so I don't feel I did enough on the project. I was never certain that I was doing things the right way. It was interesting to me that everyone approached this project very differently. We were not all using the same API endpoints and everyone was displaying slightly different information on the page.

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* \<Description>

Sight Music Lab
* A sight-reading (specifically planned for sight-singing) application. The application displays short sight-reading musical exercises. The user records themselves singing the exercise in the application (or can alternatively upload an audio file) and then they see the musical notation of what they sang below the original exercise, and receive a score on their performance. It uses an API called SonicAPI, a service which performs various audio fingerprinting, analysis and audio manipulation tasks on audio files, abcjs, a javascript library for displaying musical notation on the web, and the MediaRecorder API to record audio in browser (and a couple additional APIs and JS libraries). The scoring is loosely based on the Colorado All-State choir scoring, because I initially developed this application with the hight school students I student taught in mind.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>

* This was the most difficult, and incidentally the most incomplete/ unfinished, project I have done at Turing. It was a unique challenge to figure out how to develop an application that no one else has really done on the web using APIs and technology that not many people are using or have used yet.
* I have so much more I want to do on this project, and I wish I had finished more of what I set out to do, but I am proud of the work I did. I was not sure this would be possible when I started. * The project gave me more confidence that I will be able to figure new things out and make things work that I didn't already know how to do

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* \<Description>

* A JSON API seeded from CSV files of sanitized Etsy data with various business intelligence and business analytics endpoints.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>

* This project was very manageable and was a great first project of the module.
* I didn't feel very confident in my ability to perform more complex ActiveRecord and SQL queries coming into module 3, and this project gave me the experience I needed.
* The project helped me develop a reliable process for approaching these types of problems
* I liked that we built an API before we consumed an API - I think it paved the way for me to understand what an API was and how to use it.

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* \<Description>

* An API for a multi-player mastermind game built on top of an existing brownfield project of a single player mastermind game. It includes a small user interface for users to sign up and register for an API key. Users are then sent an activation link in an email. Upon activation, users can send post requests to the API to play the game.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>

* This project was extremely humbling at the beginning. It was difficult to write clean maintainable code. I think my partner and I felt clueless for the first couple days.
* I enjoyed the pairing aspect of this project. My partner and I paired on almost 100% of the work on this project and I think we were actually more productive for this reason.
* I tried to build out a user interface by consuming our own API on the server side which did not work even remotely. I think that helped me to make the connection to why so many applications are built to consume an API on the client side.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
\<3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently for each gear up>

* My main takeaway from all the Gear Ups this module was to continue pursuing open communication with the people you work and interact with.
* I don't think you can ever be done learning to how to work better with a community of people, and I have learned so much from discussions with my peers at Turing.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* \<Link &/or blurb about the option you chose (blog post, lead a spike or posse, lightning talk, open source contribution or pair > 3 times)>

* I forgot about this. Will be sure to write a blog source, and look into an open source project to contribute to over our week off.
* Link to my lightning talk slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jda5c3Eu9K1ScgA8vqg1vdHZ8B9YYCvPHgYnFXH0L1c/edit#slide=id.p

#### **Posse**
  >* \<Blurb about what you did with your posse over the module>
  >* \<Your favorite thing about the posse experience>
  >* \<How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?>

  * I started working on a project for Pahlka that connects people looking to donate items (people who are moving, etc.) with charities looking for donations of those items. I am really excited about this project.
  * A couple Turing alumni came to Pahlka and spoke about their jobs and experience working in Civic Tech. It inspired me to hear that they had found successful careers building technology that aligned with their values and that was making a positive difference.

#### **Playing a Part**

> \<How else you've contributed to the community>

* I feel I was not as involved in the community as I would have liked this module. I wasn't in SAB this mod, so the impetus was on me to seek out opportunities to be involved in the community more than it has been. I think I could have been much more proactive about getting involved.
* I joined Pahlka this module, and was (and am ) really excited about what they were working on.
* I was part of a team preparing to participate in GoCode colorado last weekend in Fort Collins, but I was not able to attend because my personal project was much more time consuming than I had predicted. That was disappointing
* I attended a couple meetups
* I intended to go to more JCS meetings, and I continually forgot they were happening.. Next module I'm putting an alert in my phone so I remember to go.
