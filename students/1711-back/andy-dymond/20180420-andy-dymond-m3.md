# Andy Dymond - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

 I set out to learn how to create & consume from APIs.
   * All of our projects throughout the mod made it almost impossible to not accomplish this goal.
 I set out to create a personal project I could be proud to show employers.
   * I just finished my project and feel good about it, and will add a recipe stats portion that I think will add a lot to the app.
 I set out to begin networking and getting involved in the local tech community.
   * I did so by attending 4+ meetups including denver.rb & codefordenver

| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 3 |

 * I'm having a hard time figuring out how to push myself to confidently be in a place where I've hit a 4 on something. I feel like I put in the time but don't have the best time management strategies sometimes.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

 **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
 * First API consumption project, recreating a GitHub with the GitHub API
 * This was a pretty challenging project, combining research skills with new concepts & technology. I feel like I took a lot away from this project.

 **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
* RecipeResource - this was an extension of my mod2 RailsMiniProject. I started from scratch this time and accomplished a lot more useability and database complexity on this project, and worked with a lot of new gems and platforms.
* Time management felt like a big issue here, but I ended up getting most of what I set out to done. I'm not sure if it comes with time or if there are strategies but I feel like I chose to prioritize some features/functionality like double authentication and multitenant authorization that while very useful made my app feel more simple than it could have otherwise been.

## B: Group Work & Projects

 **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
* First API building project, got to build an API for the first time and bolster understandings of JSON, endpoints, ActiveRecord and SQL.
* Thought this was a fun project and a great transition from mod2.

 **[Battleshift](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/battleshift)**
* Brownfield project implementing a halfbaked game of battleshift over an api, this project was pretty hard in terms of actually getting our bearings.
* This project was great for showing some of the tradeoffs that have to be made when working with brownfield code. It was also really good for developing an understanding of the importance of getting to know your codebase a little before jumping in full steam ahead.

## C. **Gear Ups**

  * I thought the groupthink gear up was a really good concept and is an important thing to talk about.
  * It does seem as though it might not be the best session for instructors to lead, as it generally seems like an extra/last-minute task they have to take on. As such I sometimes feel like the gear ups aim to achieve deep reflection but end up being kind of lackluster and trite.
  * I think gear ups are really important precisely because of the reflection they should bring to the community. Maybe we could make them be taken more seriously by moving them toward the beginning of the mod and having gear-up topic experts lead them?

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
* I went to CodeForDenver 2x and continue to go, and both times made contributions to their OWLET project repo.

#### **Posse**
 * I'm in pahlka posse, it's how I learned about code for denver, but the project my team was working on kind of fell to the wayside.
 * I've enjoyed working with and meeting alums and trying to figure out how to deal with projects I don't know how to handle.

#### **Playing a Part**

* I've made a point to try to help mod1 and mod2 students whenever they need me to
