# Andy Dymond - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  * Technically, I set out to learn about database relationships & how deploying websites online, which I accomplished. I also set out to put up a personal website & become comfortable with html and css, I haven't polished my personal site yet, but I will do that this Saturday and feel very prepared to do so.
  * Personally, I set out to get more involved in the Turing community, which I did by making myself available to mod1 students and joining Pahlka Schools to get a jump on working with API's and meet more students out of my mod.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  * Staying focused. I felt overstimulated a lot this mod and feel like I didn't really do the best job I could have at managing my time and structuring my schedule and goals to help me maintain my focus. I think this contributed to my not reaching out to my mentors as much as I could have, which is something I'd really like to change next mod & this intermission.

## Blog

Link your blog post here. Include a short description of your topic (one sentence is fine).
  On my last day in mod 1, I had a vague understanding of class methods, and mod 2 made them way clearer, but I wasn't satisfied with resources available for understanding what they were from a mod1 vantage, so I wrote an explanation I hope is clear even to rubyists who haven't dived into activerecord & rails:

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  I think BikeShare was my favorite project, because it strengthened my git workflow, and was a great summary of all the concepts we learned this mod.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  That focusing on mvp is a valuable tool for avoiding the feeling of being in over your head.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  I learned better planning and communication skills, and how to negotiate making projects that are too much for one person happen.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  I really enjoyed the privilege gear up, largely because it was one of the best run. Some of this mod's gear-ups felt a little lackluster and fluff-based compared to last mod. I think the topics covered were important, but I would have liked to start with some more challenging questions (especially re: feedback). I also think a stress & time management gearup would be just as if not more valuable in mod 2.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  * I joined Palha schools with a couple classmates and it looks like we're picking up the mantle from mod 4 backenders to keep the posse going, which I'm really excited about
  * I tried to remain available as much as possible to mod1 students.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  * Develop my relationships with mentors more.
