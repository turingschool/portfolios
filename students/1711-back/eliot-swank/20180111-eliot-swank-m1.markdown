# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  * I honestly didn't have specific goals for this module other than to get into Mod 2. Generally speaking, though, I wanted to learn the basics of data structures and algorithms. Although I don't think I've mastered these, I believe I've learned much in the last 6 weeks.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  * I think I struggled most with enumerables and knowing how to implement them, specifically the syntax. I feel more comfortable than I did two weeks ago; however, I am still a little slow in implementing them. I've learned from this struggle to keep going and ask questions. My stress management skills in the beginning were poor, and that affected my learning in the beginning. I've worked through a lot of the stress with new stress management techniques, and I feel more relaxed and ready to improve my skills.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite project was Night Writer. Andrew, my partner, and I worked very well together and equally contributed to the project's completion. This was the least stressful project, and I think after the project, my confidence grew, and I started to get more of the material in class. My least favorite project was Jungle Beats. It was an early project, and I was still struggling to get my feet underneath me.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
The biggest thing I learned was better time management. Sal's advice of planning backward was a good reminder how important planning is.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
The paired project taught me how important communication and planning is with a partner. I already have good interpersonal skills, so it was important for me to focus on sketching out the approach to the problem with Andrew early so we could get going in the right direction when we started to code.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
I wish the Working Styles Gear Up involved the project partner, so we could do the DTR together during the session, instead of doing a mock DTR and then doing it again with the partner. It seems like that would be a better use of that time.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
This being the first mod (and a mod I struggled in), I didn't do too much, however, I did give several suggestions to SAB.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I look forward to helping the new Mod 1 people as I repeat the mod.
