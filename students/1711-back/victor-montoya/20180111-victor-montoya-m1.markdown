## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

**I wanted to get a good base of understanding of the Ruby programming language. I also wanted to start building my network with mentors, upper mod students and my classmates who will help me now and in the future. I think that I was successful for the most part, there's always a lot to improve on, but as far as learning the basics and building my network I did pretty good.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

**I got behind once we started learning and working on classes and testing, it was hard for me.I learned that when you're struggling with a problem in your code you should always ask for help, that was one of my main issues to begin, not asking people for help.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

**Favorite project for me was Flashcards, I feel like I learned a lot from that one and that's why I like it. Least favorite was Jungle Beats because I had no idea how things went together and I couldn't do much.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

**I learned that you must plan ahead of time, Sal told us to plan backwards time-wise. I find that a very important skill to have in this environment.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

**How coding with a partner is very different from working on a solo project, but you learn to always being open to other ideas and compromising. You learn that everyone has a different way of working so it's a good experience to have.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

**I liked all the Gear Up sessions, it was a nice change of pace. Everything that's being thought I know will be very helpful, and getting to work with FEE is also fun.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

**I tried to be as much help as I could to my classmates. The Turing community has been nothing but good to me, and I did the same in any ways I could.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

** I'll be repeating this mod but next time around I want to help the new students whenever possible. I want to be more of an extroverted person and participate more in class lectures or discussions, I think it will be more helpful to others by doing so.
