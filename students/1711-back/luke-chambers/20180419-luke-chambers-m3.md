# Luke Chambers - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> My goal this module was to dive deeper into machine learning and get better in the Rails environment. I also wanted to participate in the community through mentorship and GoCodeCO.

>* I was challenged quite a bit this module, but I really enjoyed it. It was refreshing to be able to push through this.
>* \<Notes>

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* I built an Eve Online app that consumed the new Eve Online SSO and API.
>* Because Eve Online switched to SSO and changed their API from XML to JSON, there wasn't any OmniAuth strategy that I could use. Because of that, I built my own OmniAuth strategy and released it as a gem.

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* An app designed to utilize a refugee API to assist in tracking for private investigators from the Red Cross
>* I bit off a bit more than I could chew, but I was able to finish it. The machine learning was very challenging since I don't have a background in math and am only now getting better at it.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* Build out an API to serve up Black Thursday info
>* Building an API is easier then I thought it would be.

> **[Battleshift](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* Battleshift was a brownfield project that required extra functionality to be built over the top of it.
>* This was one of the projects that I learned the most on. My partner and I made some bad decisions at first, but every bad decision is a learning experience that won't be repeated.

## C. **Gear Ups**

I really enjoyed the Group Think gear up. There is always a lot of discussion that is generated in the mod2/3 gear ups. I also enjoyed the Tech in Health Mod4 gear up. I was able to learn quite a bit about some of the emerging technologies and talk about the ethics of tech in medicine.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* Open source contribution: [OmniAuth Eve O](https://github.com/lnchambers/omniauth-eve_o)

#### **Playing a Part**

> I participated in GoCodeCO as well as mentored several mod1 and mod2 students.
