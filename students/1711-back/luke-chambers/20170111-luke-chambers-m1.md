# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

* I came into Turing with little idea of what to expect. I set out to be challenged and to learn more about my place at Turing. These goals were admittedly broad, but they have become narrower as time here at Turing has progressed. They have become more about becoming proficient in specific areas of Ruby. I don't, however, feel successful. My driving force in learning is to know everything about any topic. I can do things now that I didn't dream myself ever doing six weeks ago, but I am in no way done. In the specific confines of Module 1, I would say I have been successful, but that doesn't satisfy my desire to accomplish things.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

* The project Mastermind held the most struggle for me. It wasn't because of the difficulty of the code, it was because it set the base as to what I can expect of myself during Turing. I came in to this with effectively zero knowledge of coding and being in the Echo group forced me to attack this head on. I spent many long days staring at Ruby with no idea what to do. Mastermind tore me out of a pie in the sky mindset and forced me to sludge through reality. It set the tone to how I approach projects now. It was the hardest struggle and I would never exchange it for anything else.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

* My favorite projects were CompleteMe and Mastermind. CompleteMe was the first project that I saw the enormity of what I could build with the tool I had available. Mastermind was the challenge that I didn't expect to get the first day that I was at Turing. My least favorite project was HTTP. I felt I learned a lot less then I did with all of the other projects that I have been a partner to. I feel more confident in working with tools that I don't necessarily understand, but it didn't force me to learn everything about TCPServer. I did have some good mentors that went through it with me, though.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

* I learned how to approach projects that can either be extremely frustrating or a complete time suck. It was difficult establishing a balance as I tend to want to do all the things until they are done. My desires and my abilities didn't quite match up. They still don't, but I have learned through the projects to get to the point where I can manage both.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

* Working together on code is much harder then other paired projects I have done in the past. It has been difficult to break things up into separate chunks to work on separately and working together remotely isn't something that I have gotten down yet. I have, however, been able to work well in person and have come pretty far in remote work.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

* My favorite Gear Up was the introvert/extrovert session. Going around and looking at the challenges that people face let me understand more about how people work. I found one part especially interesting. I was looking at the 90% introverted sheet and saw that one of the major challenges is that places are typically designed around extroverts. If I am ever in a position to create a working space, I want to bring in people who are introverted to help design an area that everyone would feel safe, comfortable, and secure in. My least favorite Gear Up was the stress sessions. The two sessions were pretty stressful and there wasn't a whole lot of movement. They were stressful because it seemed like one of the goals of the PD was to convince you that you are stressed. I would like to get up and move some more as well because the chairs in Clark Hall aren't very comfortable.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

* I tried to spend this module brightening the days of people that I came across. I joined Beryllium BE which is also most likely spelled wrong. My goal was to get to know the people around me and I feel very successful in that.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

* My plan is to join more interest groups. My priorities are learning about the unique challenges facing women in tech so that I can change the environment I am in, branching out to other programming languages besides Ruby so that I can become more proficient, and making myself readily available to mod 1 students for mentoring.
