### Module 4 (Front-end)
## Francy Lang

* **Areas of Emphasis** 
* This mod I really wanted to balance being a great student and getting started on the job hunt (building relationships, and making connections). I definitely found myself overwhelmed at times when trying to prioritize, but overall I feel good about how I finished the mod - I found Mod 4's content to be very interesting and am glad we were exposed to so much. I have made connections that position me well to take on the job hunt full-time.

* **Community**
  * Summary of how you've contributed to the community - I am active in JCS and have built relationship with a student that I did Second Shift with - she is now in Mod1 and I remember being in Mod 1 and needing some mentorship from another woman.
  
  * A recap of reflections from the Gear Up session you led - Transforming Your Narrative Through Growth Mindset- I put a lot of energy into my own growth mindset and it was great to have the opportunity to share this with others. The Turing students in my gear-up were very engaging and super responsive.
