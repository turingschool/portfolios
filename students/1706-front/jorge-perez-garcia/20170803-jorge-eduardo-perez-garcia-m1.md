# Jorge Ed PerezGa - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

Firstly, I wanted to wholly dedicate myself to this program and learn as much as I possible could. I had no idea what to expect, but I quickly learned software engineering requires dedication and strict time management skills. Secondly, and most importantly, I sought to find avenues that would allow me to incorporate my knowledge of fine arts and communication design into these modules.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JorgeEdPerezGa/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

(description)
This challenging first project required us to generate a number guesser. This was the first time I became aware of the possibilities the Turing program has to offer. This project also allowed me to learn that I would eventually be able to perform tasks similar to those I currently do in on Adobe Illustrator's artboard.

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

(description)
This static comp included more visual content than past static comps (e.g. more buttons). Because this project was in the midst of the courses's module exams, I mostly learned about time management and efficiency.

## Student:
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Good work! Really nice execution of the UI, good choices for additional UI elements
- no git or github used, shared code via slack or on a jump drive -- not a sustainable way of working, both really need to quickly gain comfort with git and github and make sure they use it moving forward. It won't get easier until you use it!
- CSS needs some polish, but demonstrates a good attention to detail and a lot of care
- HTML is well thought through
- JS is in a good place for refactoring and could use a clean up pass

Functional Expectations

Advanced Beginner	Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.

HTML

Accessibility

* Novice	Knows what a semantic tag is and leverages the HTML5 structural tags to organize the content of their markup.


Style

Novice	Crafts markup with proper indentation and opening/closing tags.
Advanced Beginner	Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
Proficient	Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
Exceptional	Crafts lean, efficient markup and can speak directly to choices made to improve performance, including but not limited to, page load times, css/js optimizations, image optimizations.


CSS

Structure of Code

Proficient	Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

Implementation

Exceptional	Can articulate rationale for all parts of the CSS implementation (each line of code/CSS rule) specifically in regards to the balance of: structure of code, design integrity, performance.

JAVASCRIPT

Data Types

Advanced Beginner	Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.

Conditional Logic

Proficient	Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

Functions & Scope

Advanced Beginner	Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

Arrays

Advanced Beginner	Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

Objects & Prototypes

Novice	Can declare an object literal and define/articulate properties vs. methods for an object. Can extract values of an object’s property, and assign new properties and/or reassign values of existing properties on an object.

DOM Manipulation

Proficient	Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

Style

Proficient	Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

GIT & GITHUB

Git

Novice	Can use commits and can articulate what a commit is and why we use them. Makes large, infrequent commits directly to master branch.

Github

Advanced Beginner	Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.

DESIGN

Comp Recreation

Advanced Beginner	Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.

PAIRING

Collaboration

Proficient	Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

#### To Do

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

(description)
The To Do project tasked designers to refactor a classmate's Idea Box project into a new application that allowed end-users to append items into a to-do or task list. Part of the refactoring required altering the user interface to enhance the experience for the end-users.

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)


Receiving and giving feedback: I learned about different types of feedback. It goes hand in hand with who gives feedback so you have to be attentive with how you're predisposed to seeing it. Learning about feedback helped me think about not only collegial relationships, but also feedback with familial and personal relationships. I reinforced what I learned on how to give feedback during critiques in art school. 


Professional development: Professional development is a big key to success; in today's world, emotional IQ is just as important as technical expertise. I learned about social media profiles and creating an online persona. I alsolearned I should update and maintain ocial media profiles that I've historically neglected (e.g. LinkedIn). 

Debugging the gender gap: Since a young age, I have been an ally for women's equality. The movie motivated me to push further into 
being a strong voice in a male dominated tech world.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)

For networking purposes, I believe it is important to make friends rather than contacts, and I made it a goal to befriend my project partners. I also made it a point to empathize with my fellow classmates.  Through my own struggles, I held a positive attitude while working or talking with others to build a sense of community. On a personal level, I led two yoga classes for my fellow module-mates that (hopefully) allowed others to temporarily escape their stresses and focus on rejuvenating their mental health.
