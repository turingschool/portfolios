 #### Evaluator: Limbo
 #### Students: Nik Bornemeier
 #### Comments: CLEAN UP spacing and ensure consistency across code-base !IMPORTANT! const > let (lead with it and let an error tell you otherwise) look for areas to refactor including: duplicate setState statements duplicate functionality Large functions / chunks of code graphs are badass!
 
#### Rubric
 
##### Specification Adherence
 
3.5 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

 ##### CSS/Design
 
3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.
 
 ##### Testing
 
3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing.
 
 ##### PropType Implementation
 
 Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.
 
 +### SWapi-Box

 * [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)
 
 #### Evaluator: Will
 #### Students: Alex Banister, Nik Bornemeier, John Michael Boudreaux
 #### Comments: Great job recognizing when helper functions are needed, keep going in this direction. Try to avoid double or triple looping (maps in maps in maps), and separate fetch calls into different functions.
 
 #### Rubric
 
 ##### Specification Adherence
 
 4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.
 
 ##### Code Quality
 
 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
 
 ##### CSS/Design
 
 3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.
 
 ##### Testing
 
 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested
 
 ##### PropType Implementation
 
 Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.
 
 ##### Code Sanitation
 
 The output from ESLint shows…
 
 4 - Zero complaints
 
 ##### Workflow
 
 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren’t reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
I gave two workshps, one on Router and one on Redux.  I also made myself availtable to my claseemates to help them in any way that I could.  I feel that I was able to help several of my cohort mates better understand certain concepts.
