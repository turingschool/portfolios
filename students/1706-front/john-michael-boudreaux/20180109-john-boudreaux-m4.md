## Areas of Emphasis

There was a big emphasis on getting back to the basics from mod1. using vanilla and jquery again was interesting. 
Getting familiar with databases and servers was also a large part of this mod and something that I think is very
valuable and will come in very handy in my new career

### Projects

#### Palette Picker

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/palette-picker.html)

Palette Picker was interesting. It was the first project in a while that we were not allowed to use react. It was tough to realize that I
had already lost touch with some of the moer basic parts of javascript. It was nice to get back in and sort of re-learn.

#### BYOB

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/build-your-own-backend.html)

I really got into understanding what was going on inside an express server during this project. It was a bit intimidating
at first, but in the end I did enjoy getting an in depth look at how everything works together.

#### House Of Vars

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/house-of-vars.html)

This one was cool. I really liked the open source contribution aspect of this project. There wasnt much code writing in this
project like the rest of them, but there was a lot of value in the contribution and communication piece.

#### Squad Goals

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)

Luke Finney and I partnered on this project. We dug in and created what I think is a pretty cool app. I learned a lot and it 
was great to get back into react.

## D: Professional Skills

I thought the session that we led this inning went really well. The other students were eager to give their insights and made
easy for us all to carry on a solid disussion about some important issues.

### Playing a Part

I didnt get to do many extra activities this round. I did attend several iron FE sessions, but tht is about it.
