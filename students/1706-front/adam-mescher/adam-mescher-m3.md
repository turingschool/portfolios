-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod saw the introduction of projects that were very challenging technically and pushed me as a developer to make significant strides. 

#### Possibull

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamMescher/possibull)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

Stock market portfolio simulation game in which a user is given a cool fake million and is let loose into the wild world of finance.

### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

**2. Organization**

* 2: Developer used a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently.

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 3: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).

**2. Code Quality**

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.

### Product Experience

**1. User Experience**

* 2: Project exhibits some gaps in the UX.

**2. Performance**

* 4: Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### HeadCount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamMescher/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.

You will start the project by importing files containing various educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district.

# HeadCount Eval

- stupid components were pretty stupid. thats pretty neat.

## Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

## Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React but demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

## PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

## CSS/Design

3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

## Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing.

#### SWapi-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamMescher/SWAPIbox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

For this project, we are going to work on developing some muscle memory building out React components. At this point you’ve built at least one basic React app in the past. Now’s the time to leverage that and add some complexity.

For this project, we will be hitting The Star Wars API to tap into a “black hole” of Star Wars data.

# SWapi-Box Eval

### Evaluator: Will
### Students: Rufus Welsh, Adam Mescher
### Comments: Good use of localStorage, consider splitting calls to local storage into its own helper file. Break large
### functions into smaller pieces, don't skip testing.

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

1 - There was little to no attempt to test this application.

### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - No complaints here

### Workflow

4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren’t reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

#### MovieTracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamMescher/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

This project is working off the The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies. Pretty simple right? HA HA not!

### notes:

- reach for the smallest thing first (easiest)
- be mindful of how you are looping through data and how that effects performance
- fix your login reducer. 

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

- 2.5 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing some of the features outlined in the specification above.


### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design


- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 3,5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.


#### Design + Build Team Hackathon

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamMescher/ui-ux-challenge)
* [Original Assignment]()

In this one-day design-a-thon, you will be asked to work through the life cycle of a project brief: design, build, and review/critique. In the morning, we designed a fitness tracker app and in the afternoon we swapped with another team and built what we were given. I'm very happy with the way this project turned out as my partner and I got very close to the original designer's intent.
