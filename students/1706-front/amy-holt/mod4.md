# Amy Holt Module 4 (Front-end)
### Areas of Emphasis
I was very excited to come into Mod 4 and learn about back end. I utilized a back end in my personal project in Mod 3 and learned a lot but still didn't have my head wrapped around how everything connected. My goal was to have a solid understanding and feel more confident in myself and my technical abilities. I wanted to stay focused all the way through the last day and get the most I could out of my time Turing.

### Community
I am active in JCS and I lead a women's study group 1-2 times per week.

I really enjoyed our Gear Up Session on 'Be Your Own Ally'.  We had a group of thoughtful people who were very vulnerable in sharing their stories. A lot of participants shared that they felt more supported knowing they weren't alone in the way they felt, and that they felt more empowered and equipped to speak up for themselves more in pairings.
