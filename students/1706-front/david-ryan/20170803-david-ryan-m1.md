## A: End of Module Assessment
I believe I passed.  I have a strong grasp of the material.  I really need to continue to work on personal development/time management though. I dropped the ball the last week in terms of scheduling and sort of prematurely deflated over the last weekend leading up to pentahalon.  


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I struggled a little bit after the long break but the general anxiety subsided as we got deeper into the mod.  My goal was to really be an asset to my partners as a repeater and work on refining best practices in project workflow.  Workflow and time management are where I tend to really struggle so finding methods like Kanban and tools like Waffle.io this time around really helped to solodify and encourage a lot of really healthy behavior on my part.

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.
Phase 4 is optional. If you execute phase 4, create a separate branch in Git for that work for evaluation (using Git is an extra challenge – investigate how to initialize a Git repo and make a branch! We’ll go over how to do this in class in a few days, so this is a great time to investigate on your own).

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

<h2>Linked List</h2>

With a little jQuery under your belt, it’s time to try your hand at building a small application.

In it’s simplest form, the application should have the following:

Two input fields
One for the title of the bookmark
One for the URL that the bookmark should link to
One button for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page
A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display:
The title of the bookmark
The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL)
A button to “Mark as Read”
A button to “Remove” the bookmark

(Intro)

<h2>Ideabox</h2>

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

<h2>2DoBox-Pivot</h2>

Do you remember that project IdeaBox?…

We thought they were pretty great, but, we think it’s time to pivot those projects over to something we like to call 2DoBox.

You will be inheriting someone’s previous IdeaBox and pivoting it over to 2DoBox.

## D: Professional Skills

I learned a lot from these sessions.  It might seem like busy work at times but really just initiating the discussion about personal development sets the stage of later mods and helps to identify early on where you might need work.

growth mindset

  The importance of positive thinking and a positive perspective can not be understated.  Making sure your selftalk isn't counter-productive and instead constructive helps to maintain motivation and your eventual success.  I have some training in this area and tend to do an effective job already of not maintaining a negative point of view.  I can be cynical at times though and have noticed it more after having this perspective presented, in this way.

learn to pairwork

Driver navigator seemed to be the best option at first, but after discovering kanban and a tool like Waffle.io I made the switch.  I think transperancy/honesty are pivitol in any relationship and pairworking is no different.  Effective communication is key.
  

working w introverts, extroverts & ambiverts

I'm an ambivert.  I consider it a considerable strength in this field.  Being borderline means I can appreciate both perspectives and empathize.  I liked this session a lot as it reminded me just how powerful taking a sort of middle path can be.

strengths and storytelling

I needed this session.  I was surprised how accurate it was.  Ideation ESPECIALLY spoke to how I would identify myself.  The thirst for finely distilled knowledge which ultimately leads to some of my other strengths like Input, Learner, Adaptability and Intellection.  I learned though that these can also be weaknesses.  Adaptability for me can also mean th inability to say no and set boundaries.

debugging the gender gap

It is clear more needs to be done to diversify the programmer pool of talent, not just for the sake of women/miniorities and their representation however, but for the sake of the industry.  The typical low-level programmer personality being overrepresented could lead to a host of other problems related to the need for diversity.  This problem is even more broad than what this documentary is able to effectively cover in such a short amount of time.  I took history of science and techonology classes each at the marco and mirco scale and learned a considerable amount about the sociological impact tech is ultimate having outside of itself but also inside.  This Documentary did a great job discussing gender equality in the workplace and manage to skim over some other broader implications of the problem.

developer identity

I want the work I do to have a profound impact on the way technology and our society evolve moving forward.  This is how I identify.  I am going to put all of my effot into blockchain tech as a means revise our current social and economic structure. I firmly believe this is our future and simply don't see any better way to bring about the kind of decentralized world I personally would like to live in.  Social Justice. Pure p2p economies and governance.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Helped my cohort as much as possible and actively participated constructively in cohort and posse discusions/collaborations.  I think stepping more into a leadship role next mod will ultimately help solidify some of my own personal commitments such as being here late nad being available to help.  I also would like to move into more leadership with iron-fe and maybe a blockchain student-group.
