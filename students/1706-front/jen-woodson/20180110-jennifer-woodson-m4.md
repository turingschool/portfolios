## A: End of Module Assessment

I believe I passed it with my late submissions. No news is good news, right? (Right??)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### (Palette Picker)

There is a website out there called Coolors - and others like it are out there. They help you generate color palettes for websites or other design projects.

Your job is to recreate some of this site’s functionality with your own backend and database. A user should be able to come to your site, generate a color palette, and save it for their own future projects.

#### (BYOB)

Practice makes practice. Last week’s project had you dive head first into a full-stack application with Node, Express, Knex, and a front-end to boot. That was a lot thrown at you in one week so this time around we are going to focus solely on the backend. You’ll be building your own API for a large dataset of your choosing.

The main focus of this project will be to reinforce your understanding of CRUD methods, querying a database, and responding with JSON data. You can do this project right now, without any new lessons.

I really enjoyed this project. We were nervous about filling all the time, but we had great discussion and had to cut some things out. More planning time would have improved our presentation.
