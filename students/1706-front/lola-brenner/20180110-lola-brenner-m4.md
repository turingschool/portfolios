Evaluation by Brittany...

##### Specification Adherence

40 points: (50 possible points) There is one feature missing from the base expectations that makes the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

##### User Interface

16 points: (20 possible points) User interface is mostly intuitive, though the instructor might need some guidance on interactions. Styling is mostly consistent, but could use some clean up. Application may be missing some relevant feedback that would help guide the user.

##### Testing

19 points: (20 possible points) Project has a running test suite that tests every server-side endpoint with many happy and sad path cases.

##### Commented Server File

10 points: (10 possible points) Each line of the server file (on a separate branch) is commented and explains the code using precise, correct terminology and specificity

##### JavaScript Style

22 points: (30 possible points) Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Workflow

17 points: (20 possible points)

##### To get a 3 on this project, you need to score 120 points or higher
##### To get a 4 on this project, you need to score 140 points or higher

#### Final Score: 124 / 150

#### BYOB

##### Documentation

7 points: The README includes documentation for all available endpoints and how to use them. Instructor can mostly follow the documentation for using the API.

##### Feature Completion

60 points: Developer has implemented all 10 endpoints, 4 are secured via JWTs but is missing a custom endpoint that filters data based on query params. The database is seeded with at least two tables and one relationship.

##### Testing & Linting & Error Handling


##### JavaScript Style
