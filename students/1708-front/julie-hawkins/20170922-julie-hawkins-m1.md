# Julie Hawkins - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Going into the first module I had no idea what to expect, the only thing I could plan for was to be full-force dedicated to this new venture. I was told(warned) that it would be exhausting and frustrating and to be ready for the struggle, and that is all true but I am excited to find that I am truly having fun learning how to write code. I wanted to establish smart time-boxing skills and set good practices and habits for workflow.

##### Partner Feedback: 
  Dear Julie, I really enjoyed working with you on our Linked List project! Your positivity in the face of problems and determination to continue trying things until our features were fixed helped me understand that I am sometimes too quick to jump to “giving up” when I get frustrated. You showed me that all issues can be fixed with persistence and a good attitude. It was also helpful for me to see how you approach a project with an intention of customizing certain features (scrollbar) and going above and beyond the specs to make the project your own. You reminded me that the point of these projects is learning new things, and in my opinion, working on features that are your own idea is the best motivation to learn. In the future, I think the biggest area of improvement you could work on is getting comfortable with GitHub workflow.  We both came into this project with little experience using GitHub and learned a lot in the process. I think as you continue to improve your git/GitHub skills, it will help you be able to implement more of your awesome ideas by being comfortable working on them in separate branches so that you have the freedom to try anything without affecting the rest of your projects. Thanks, Katie

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/julieahawkins/ideabox-r-j)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This project was to create an app that allows the user to create a list of ideas. The app user local storage to store the users ideas. The user is able to edit previously created ideas and there is a search functionality. The ideas can be upgraded or downgraded based on quality. The user can delete unwanted ideas. 

##### Evaluator: Louisa
##### Notes/What To Work On:

- really nicely executed layout
- clean HTML and CSS
- ARIA! Yay!
- A couple spots to tighten up JS, but overall really nicely done

##### Functional Expectations
* Proficient	The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

##### HTML
##### Accessibility
* Proficient	Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
##### Style
* Proficient	Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

##### CSS
##### Structure of Code
* Proficient	Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.
##### Implementation
* Proficient	Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

##### JAVASCRIPT
##### Data Types
* Proficient	Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
##### Conditional Logic
* Proficient	Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
##### Functions & Scope
* Proficient	Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
##### Arrays
* Proficient	Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.
##### Objects & Prototypes
* Proficient	Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
##### DOM Manipulation
* Proficient	Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
##### Style
* Proficient	Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

##### GIT & GITHUB
##### Git
* Proficient	Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.
##### Github
* Proficient	Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

##### DESIGN
##### Comp Recreation
* Proficient	Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

##### PAIRING
##### Collaboration
* Proficient	Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

##### Partner Feedback:
  You were a great partner for IdeaBox! Your commitment to carefully following the comp, writing clean and organized code, and understanding every step in the JS, really helped us put together a cohesive and well-built project. It also made the eval go well. I appreciated your positive attitude and hard work throughout the process. It felt like you were picking up new things in regards to github workflow and sublime shortcuts every day. Continuing to do that will make sure your projects continue to go smoothly and quickly in the future. I look forward to seeing how your skills develop during your time at Turing. Hopefully we'll get the chance to work together again in the future.

#### 2DoBox-Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/julieahawkins/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This project required the use of the base code from another group's IdeaBox. The existing code was then refactored and pivoted into another application. The new app allows users to generate a list of to-dos or tasks. The tasks can be modified after they are created and can be given 5 different levels of importance. There is functionality to search for tasks and to sort them by importance. The tasks can be marked as complete and are removed from view on page refresh unless called back into view. The user can delete cards. 

##### Student: Brandon and Julie H
##### Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
##### Notes/What To Work On:

- Missing functionality w/some extras: 
	App shows more than the last 10 completed todos (part of phase 3) but YAY for character count functionality extension in Task input!

- Good work w/following: 
	Majority of refactoring - getting rid of anon functions, no deep-nested if/else statements, no global variables, and concise functions. CSS file neatly organized with very few areas that could be refactored. Discovering (and implementing) ternary operators. Doing a DTR and respecting each other's learning goals - sounded like the pairing went well!

- Room for improvement w/following:
	Indentation/nesting/spacing in HTML. DRYing up code so that multiple functions/event listeners associated with showing cards based on importance work as a single, dynamic function (225-278). Same with edit title/edit body functions. Commenting between each event listener in JS file makes it harder to read.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up)

#### Growth Mindset
This session introduced the idea of growth mindset and fixed mindset. I feel it was a good way to preface the rest of the mod with the notion of "not yet" and how to recognize growth mindset and fixed mindset. I learned about how to pivot feelings that place us in fixed mindset and present these feelings in a way that allows growthmind set to step in. After this session, I still find myself pin pointing when a fixed mindset is creeping up on me and using the phrase "not yet" to change my thought process.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things
This session was about how we feel about learning difficult things and how this impacts our ability to learn. There was an emphasis on how our cognative resources are used and drained by our emotions and subconscious thoughts. I can notice a big difference in how my brain preforms and my problem solving abilities depending on my emotional state and physical state.

#### Dealing with Difference: Introverts & Extroverts
This session was a discussion on how different workstyles can co-exist and support eachother. I thought this session was important because it allowed me time to recognize that my workstyle and strengths can be understood by others even if they don't share the same styles/strengths.  I was nice to hear directly from others about how they understand different workstyles and how they prefer to approach things.

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap
This session was eye-opening and informative, specifically the actually statistics about women and minorities in tech fields. I was not suprised by any of the content but it did remind me about the biases and inequalities that exist and how important it is to continue to push for evolution both in our smaller communities and outward. I was grateful that this discussion was encouraged. 

#### Case Study with Mod 4 : UX/UI
I really enjoyed this session about user experience and user interface. The mod4 students seemed excited to present the topic and it was informative and fun. They formed great discussion questions and gave plenty of examples of both good and bad UX/UI. I'm very driven by the concept of UX/UI and am excited to learn more about how to implement awesome code to make great user experiences!!!!

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
I feel like it was difficult to contribute to the Turing community as a whole as a mod1 student. Things get overwhelming and busy pretty quickly, so much to worry and think about. I feel that Mod2 and Posse mates, and everyone has been extremely supportive and helpful and I hope in future mods I will be able to pay it foward to the community. Within our cohort I feel I have been able to contribute to others in a meaningful way thru paired projects, group review sessions, and developing personal relationships. Although I generally feel introverted, this environment has allowed me to reach out more, I enjoy sharing solutions with others and I try to be available for others as much as I can.
