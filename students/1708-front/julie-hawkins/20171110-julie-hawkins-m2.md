# Julie Hawkins - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came into this mod hoping to keep solidifying the basic fundamentals of javascript and object manipulation. I was also excited to start creating more complex apps using api calls.

PASS


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/julieahawkins/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

A collection of sorting functions using four different types of sorting algorithms

Evaluator: Leta
Comments/Feedback: Code Review for Sorting Suite:
- Really nice, clean sorts! 
- Testing suite scales well and shows varying efficiencies of sorts
- I love that you pulled out the array generator into a helper file
- Good method of checking to see if the arrays have been sorted

PASS

#### Complete - Me

* [Github URL](https://github.com/julieahawkins/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

A prefix trie that will provide all words that match an input string and allows selected words to gain priority over other mathing words.

Evaluator: Leta
Comments/Feedback: I had an area or two where a refactor would be good and I learned where I was lacking in testing was thinking of sad paths.

##### Fundamental JavaScript & Style
3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### Test-Driven Development
3.75: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3.75: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

###### Functional Expectations
4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

##### Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…
4 - Zero complaints


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Game-Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/julieahawkins/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Create a game based on a retro video game using canvas and Object Oriented Programing.

Evaluator: Nathaniel
Comments/Feedback: Had a few areas to DRY up and needed a test or two more, overall good approach

##### Functional Expectations
3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

##### User Interface
3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

##### Testing
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

##### JavaScript Style
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Workflow
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

##### Code Sanitation
The output from ESlint shows…
4 - Zero complaints


#### Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jessewood/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Create an app using React that displays current weather and forecast data using the weatherunderground API.

Evaluator: Nathaniel
Comments/Feedback: Able to implement all functionality but had opportunities to refactor. Needed to test more for functionality.

## D: Professional Skills

Throughout this mod I learned more about how to develop my professional skills and how to employ empathy when working with partners and giving or receiving feedback. I hope to continue to improve my professional skills along with my programming skills so that I can become a better, more aware human and teammate to other humans.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod I really wanted to 'pay it forward' to mod1 and try to be available for pairings and other review sessions. I felt so appreciative of the help that the mod above me provided and I wanted to carry on the legacy/tradition of creating a network of support and trust for students at turing. I also tried to help facilitate my mod to keep working together and sharing ideas and solutions. I have observed other students that take a leadership role during posse and other community sessions and have tried to take a support role for those students, I feel that maybe I can take an active role this way without placing myself in a position that contradicts my introverted workstyle. I have taken a stronger interest in finding a way to have a bit of cross mod project work.
