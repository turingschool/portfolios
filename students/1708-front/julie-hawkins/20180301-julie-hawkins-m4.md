# MOD 4 Portfolio - JULIE HAWKINS
## ACHIEVEMENTS
* My greatest achievement of the mod was completing a 7 day code challenge while also completing my capstone project. 
Early in the mod I began to pursue a job with a company that I would absolutely love to get my tech career started with.  
After I was finally able to have a phone interview, I was given a code challenge to complete within 7 days and of course it was due the same day as capstone. I wanted to make sure to give my all to the challenge but also to the capstone and my teammates. I was unsure about how to handle all this responsibility at first. I am so proud of myself for managing my time and energy to best of my ability and completing both projects by deadline.

## STRUGGLES
* This mod the struggles I had were more mental. Juggling around school projects and job searching has been a very difficult for me. It has been the most difficult mod in terms of time boxing and personally challenging to manage responsibilites and obligations. I feel as though I was able to accomplish all the things I set out to complete but was hindered at times by feeling overwhelmed and spread too thin. These struggles have taught me about what I'm capable of and how to communicate with people about realistic expectations. 

## UNIQUE 
* My past careers in Massage Therapy and in the Colorado cannabis industry.
* My interest in the media and video games industries as a goal in tech.
* I have been trying to plan and build a JavaScript gaming suite for fun and personal growth

## THE BACK END
* I enjoyed learning back end with node and express/knex. Getting context about how the backend works was very helpfuly in rounding out my understanding of apis and endpoints. Creating schemas can actually be kinda fun. Overall, I learned that I am happy with my choice to gear more towards frontend, but that I am excited to know whats going on in backend and I would love to aim to be a swiss army knife of code knowledge.

## SKILLS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH
* team/and personal communication skills
* time management
* full stack projects!
These are some of the things I will be able to take with me moving foward out of Turing. I am very excited about my future in tech!
