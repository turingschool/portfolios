**MOD4 Presentation**

**Biggest achievement**
 - Gaining a better understanding of what goes into creating a backend. Specifically NODEjs/express/knex/postgres, relational database structure, etc.
 - Feeling like I can make a complete app front to back



**Most struggle. What did you learn.**
 - workload/content
 - perseverance
 - checking ego at the door and how important it is
 
 **What have I done that sets me apart.**
 - Pushed myself to implement many to many databases
 - Ethereum Hackathon

**How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?**

 - Came from a Salesforce Admin background
 - Being able to relate that experience with what I learned in mod4 helped substantially
 - I plan on entering the blockchain/CRM fields and this knowledge will better prepare me to do both.
 - Front-end is the wild west. Back-end is like being a collector of something in a quiet home
 - Really helped me to appreciate the complexity of modern frontend applications.

**Most important skill or lesson.**

 - Belief in myself, belief in others
 - How I learn best
 - Read the docs, get help
