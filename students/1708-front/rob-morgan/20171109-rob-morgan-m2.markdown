# Rob Morgan - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came out of Mod 1 with a basic foundation for javascript and placed most emphasis on improving in all aspects, in particular OOP concepts and array prototypes and object manipulation.  Hundreds of exercises later, I think I'm beginning to get the hang of it.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Projects - Individual

There were two individual projects: Sorting Suite and CompleteMe

*********

### Sorting Suite

* https://github.com/rmorgan323/sorting-suite (Sorting Suite - Github repo)

This project required the student to create 4 sorting algorithms.  The last two, Merge Sort and Quick Sort, were written recursively.  I live-coded Quick sort in the eval.

#### Evaluation:
Instructor: Leta
Outcome: Pass

### CompleteMe

* https://github.com/rmorgan323/Complete-Me (CompleteMe - Github repo)

In CompleteMe, I created an autocomplete for a search input, using the entire dictionary to populate the search Trie.  We later used this project as a node module to build autocomplete functionality in the Weatherly pair project.

#### Evaluation:
Instructor: Leta

* Fundamental JavaScript & Style
3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

* Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3.75: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

* Functional Expectations
3.5: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

* Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…  4 - Zero complaints

*********

## C: Projects - Group

There were two pair projects: Game Time and Weatherly.

### Game Time - Centipede

* https://github.com/t6r6l5/game-time (Github repo - Centipede)
* https://t6r6l5.github.io/game-time/ (Playable Version - Github Pages)

**Students: Rob Morgan, Thomas Laird**
Thomas and I chose to be pretty ambitious with this game, picking a game with a lot of moving parts and a TON of collision detection.  I really like how it turned out.  It looks cool and plays great.  Centipede is written in ES6 using HTML5 Canvas.

#### Evaluation:
Instructor: Nathaniel

* Functional Expectations
4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

* User Interface
3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

* Testing
4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

* JavaScript Style
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

* Workflow
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

* Code Sanitation
The output from ESlint shows…  4 - Zero complaints

### Weatherly

* https://github.com/patneel87/weatherly (Github repo - Weatherly)

**Students: Rob Morgan, Patrick Neel**
Weatherly is a desktop weather app, using the Weather Underground API.  This ended up being a really good project.  Pat and I both struggled with React at first, completely restarting the project the evening of day 2.  But from there it really took off.  Our finished project has clean code, solid functionality, and looks great too.  Weatherly is written in React.  

#### Evaluation:
Instructor: Leta

* Specification Adherence
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

* User Interface
4ish - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

* HTML Style
3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

* CSS/Sass Style
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

* JavaScript / React Style
3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

* Testing
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

* Workflow
3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

* Code Sanitation
The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…  4 - Zero complaints

## D: Gear Up Sessions

#### Johari Window
https://gist.github.com/rmorgan323/5bcb7013c7f9311a647331ca9e896cbc (Johari Window Reflections)

This was one of those things that people could easily get worked up about, but ended up being pretty inocuous. I don't know how honest people were, especially when we've only been through a few projects at the time of this session. However, the things people said about me were 100% positive. I wasn't exactly blindsided. Either I'm a really good dude or else people just don't want to hurt my feelings. I'm guessing reality is found in both columns.

So while this was an attempt to help us learn things about ourselves and perhaps be surprised by some things, I'm not sure if that was actually achieved. I'd be curious to know if anyone else was surprised by what was said. I'm guessing there aren't too many shocked expressions.

#### Feedback II
https://gist.github.com/rmorgan323/f618c8eb6592a1b8eff3367c61da143e (Feedback II Reflections)

Feedback II Reflection
Date of feedback conversation: 10/16/17

* How did you prepare for the conversation?
I didn't prepare a whole lot. We had a really positive project that we were both proud of, so I didn't have too much that I was concerned about.

* How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult?
It was easy. I was paired up with Thomas who I discovered to be one of the hardest working people I know. In that sense, we got along really well. We were both diligent and so we accomplished a lot. We both enjoyed the project.

* What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?
We both listened carefully and gave positive feedback. The only challenge I had with Thomas was that he is such a good programmer that he sometimes moves at a rate faster than I can understand. So we talked about that a little bit too.

* Any other comments:
Overall, I can see where this could be a difficult discussion if a project went sour. So far at Turing, each project I have been involved with has gone well and ended up something I was proud of. When a tougher situation comes along I hope to be ready for it.

#### Feedback III
https://gist.github.com/rmorgan323/ad978e6228ed5c8c9dcec6d0f7741730 (Feedback III Reflections)

Feedback III Reflection

* What are you doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator?
I'm good at listening to other's ideas, leading by example in working hard, and pushing through the rough spots by staying positive.

* How do you use your strengths as a team member?
I stay positive and encouraging. I also make sure that the work gets done.

* How would you like to continue to develop your strengths?
I mainly want to be a better programmer so that I can get things done more quickly and spend less time getting stuck. I also want to continue to learn how to leverage other people's abilities to benefit the project.

* What would you like to improve on as a teammate?
I want to get better at using other people's talents for the good of everyone. I want to get the most out of each individual in my group.

* How would you like your teammates to see you?
I'd like the to see me as a person who is easy to get along with and who works hard. Those are the main things.

#### Empathy
https://gist.github.com/rmorgan323/6aabbee1fab320fa8e2f78c447deca7c (Empathy Reflections)

Empathy Gear Up - Reflections

To be honest, I found this session frustrating. Everyone has experienced at least a few of the things on the list. Some, more than a few. In my opinion, the biggest one is: ___ You grew up in a single-parent household. It's my observation that this is the single greatest predictor of success or failure in life. I've been fortunate in this regard and I really feel for those who haven't.

While empathy is very important, I don't think anyone should have to apologize for the good fortunes they've had in life. Rather, they should use the good things they've been blessed with to help out others. And I don't know anyone who has been given everything in life--we all have struggles and the struggles of each person are individual to that person.

#### Social Movements
https://gist.github.com/rmorgan323/4054585ca41ebd3fdd6d60d688ac6018 (Social Movements Gearup)

Experience has shown me how many people are out there who are interested in helping out the helpless, volunteering in their communities, and otherwise doing the right thing. Yet, in our world, the good in these things has often been made into some kind of political statement, as if only one side has an interest in seeing others succeed.

So I'm interested in helping to connect those who need help with those who are excited to give it: Connecting the homeless, needy, addicted, depressed, hopeless, etc., with those who can teach job skills, life skills, organizational skills, give counsel, provide medical care, homes, home repairs, transportation and more. It's my belief that these issues and the solution to these issues are not political in nature. So my desire is to use technology to find both: those who are needy and those who are excited to help, and connect them, and to do so in a way that doesn't become just another in a long line of movements to be claimed by a political movement for the purposes of adding a voting bloc to someone's election campaign.

There are places where this kind of thing is going on already. The homeless shelters I have been involved with in the past are often found doing the difficult work in the darkest corners of society. Many do amazing work, despite the difficult and thankless nature of the work. I'd like to leverage technology to help them.

#### Tragedy of the Commons
https://gist.github.com/rmorgan323/4d16fe670e9d3d2f774c826de6c7229a (Tragedy of the Commons Gearup)

* Let's say tech executives (consciously or subconsciously) seek teams in which at least 1/3 of team members are like them (gender, age, race). How will this impact the types of jobs available?
I suppose it would depend on the gender, age, and race of the executives. It would seem that if the race, age, and gender, of tech execs matched that of the general population, then their workforce would match as well. This probably isn't true, although I don't know the actual statistics. Assuming that all tech execs are white men, which seems to be where this question is leading, then I'd assume the available jobs would lean that way as well.

* Diversity "quotas" are sometimes dismissed as counter-productive or missing the point of actually valuing diversity. PotP does demonstrate how they may add some value. What are your attitudes toward diversity quotas; does this game change your assumptions?
Let's, for a moment, insist that Turing had a strict diversity quota on enrollment. Immediately, there would be a significant drop in enrollment, since a majority of students are white--and a majority of the white students are male.

* In many situations, a strict diversity quota simply wouldn't work. However, if your version of a diversity quota is to ensure that you actively market your business, school, or work position, to underrepresented groups, then I think that has the potential to help your business and increase happiness among employees--as well as find the best and most qualified talent.
I believe there is danger on both sides of this argument. It is important, beneficial, and profitable for a group to be diverse. It is also important, beneficial, and profitable for a business to hire the most qualified/best talent available, and to do so with a long-term view, trying to determine the potential of the individual applying for the position. This is, needless to say, difficult.

* Given the patterns illuminated by PotP, what other strategies may be effective in counteracting bias?
The game is, I believe, suggesting diversity quotas--i.e. moving if too low of a percentage of people are different.

* PotP speaks to the power of group norms: a seemingly innocuous attitude, wanting to be surrounded by at least 1/3 of people who look like you, when embraced by a large group, can have huge implications on that community. Considering this reality, what knowledge and understandings should Turing impart to students to ensure they do not enter the field perpetuating ideas that are in conflict with our mission.
I've written about this in other gear up sessions. But I recommend love. Teach people that love is that only force powerful enough to conquor hate. Teach people to love each other regardless of their views or backgrounds. I think forcing diversity has led groups to hate not only others, but even themselves. Loving people has a byproduct of diversity, but not simply for the sake of diversity. Love isn't a show, so that others don't think you are racist. Love isn't selfish--it doesn't try to create a diverse environment for the sake of profit. Rather, love IS the product, and the byprodoct is the results of your work.
As well, there is a pipeline issue. If the number of people from a particular minority group doesn't change, then I don't see how a company can address the issue. In the game, if you lower the number from one group to a small number, then everyone is in a state of perputal movement/unhappiness--only a few isolated pods are happy. I think this is a more realistic representation of how our world is working (or isn't working).

* PotP is a pretty sweet example of how technology can illustrate complex ideas. What are PotP's goals, and how effective do you think the game is in advancing those goals?
I think it depends on the audience. Most grownups are pretty set in their views and assume they are right. Not many people over college undergrad age change their opinions easily. However, I liked the data visualization, and I think the presentation was thought-provoking, moreso than a blog post would have been.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

As with Mod 1, I was very often found at school early and late.  That allowed me to get better get to know the rest of my class and to study in a place where it was easy to remain focused.  I connected much more with the rest of my cohort in Mod 2 and spent a lot of time helping others along, as well as being helped out when I needed it.

Also, I made myself consistently available for pairing with Mod 1 students and eagerly helped when possible.  In the evenings, I sometimes walked through the Mod 1 room to find those who needed help.
