## A: End of Module Assessment

I believe I fulfilled the requirements to move on from Module 1.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects for Mod 1 were Number Guesser at the start of the mod followed by the three static compositions. I believe that these projects provided an opportunity to achieve personal growth over the course of the module by taking full ownership of both the deficiencies and successes of any given project.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/t6r6l5/Number-Guesser)
* [GitHub URL - Two Player Version](https://github.com/t6r6l5/Number-Guesser-2Player)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number guesser was the first project which utilized the skills of DOM manipulation in javascript. This project provided the foundation upon which subsequent projects were built. The goal of Number guesser was to provide an application in which the user could put in a random guess which would then be evaluated based upon a random number.

#### Static Comp One

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/t6r6l5/tl-comp-challenge-1)
* [GitHub Pages](https://t6r6l5.github.io/tl-comp-challenge-1/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

The goal of static comp one was to recreate a comp using newly learned CSS skills. The composition, in this case, was a resumé with squares for different skills and a large photo to the right.

Evaluation Comments: Limit use of VH/VW and % based sizing. Use consistent margins to limit situations in which their are large open spaces or where box contents are barely fitting inside boxes.

#### Static Comp Two

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/t6r6l5/tl-comp-challenge-2)
* [GitHub Pages](https://t6r6l5.github.io/tl-comp-challenge-2/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

Static comp two's goal was to build a website with a simple header and then a series of 'cards' below with a variety of information contained inside each one.

Evaluation Comments: Use set widths and heights for cards to appropriately contain contents. Be mindful of how the legibility of the information will change on various screen sizes. Figure out how to manipulate hover states on icons in addition to text on navigation.

#### Static Comp Three
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/t6r6l5/tl-comp-challenge-3)
* [GitHub Pages](https://t6r6l5.github.io/tl-comp-challenge-3/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

Static comp three's goal was to build out a complicated website with a navigation bar to the left and a variety of different areas of content in the main section. This composition represented a challenge in terms of effectively displaying and positioning elements throughout the body of the page while being mindful of those things might be adjusted on different screen widths.

Evaluation Comments: Be mindful of details when it comes to spacing/alignment along the edges of the page. Effective use of limited page width for larger blocks of text and considering adjustments to alignment where necessary.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects in Mod 1 represented an opportunity to tackle the problem of tackling complex problems in a collaboratory environment. Git/Github workflow, pair programming and project organization were amongst the important subjects that were introduced throughout the mod. 

#### Linked Lists

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/t6r6l5/LinkedLists)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked lists was the first pair project and its goal was to build a website which allowed users to create a list of bookmarks which they could then mark as read or delete. It also introduced and built upon the concepts of paired programming and collaboration.

Evaluation comments: well done! JS was very verbose in areas (specifically around appending the cards to the DOM).  Refactoring would drastically reduce the number of lines of code and increase clarity/legibility. Well crafted CSS and HTML
overall, code is well crafted and carefully considered. It is clean, and well thought through.

Partner Feedback: “You were a great partner - I felt like we communicated well with each other and you were great at keeping in touch even though we couldn’t always physically work in the same place. You know what you are doing and are great at looking up what you don’t know. In the future, I’d suggest what I’d suggest for myself - even when the project is working to keep pushing to make better code that is more succinct and easier to read.”


#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/t6r6l5/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

IdeaBox's purpose was to build an app that stored a bunch of ideas which could then be upvoted/downvoted, amended, deleted or searched. This introduced the concept of localstorage and data manipulaton via the DOM as well as sorting and filtering. 

Evaluation Comments: Make sure you're watching indentation! Mind the little details. Well crafted code, could use a refactor pass (which is a good place to be).  Both have solid ownership of entire codebase. Make sure you're being mindful accessibility best practices.

Feedback to Me:
"Dear Thomas, I really enjoyed working with you on our LinkedList project.  I liked how we were able to accomplish a lot working independently, but then come together to make sure that everything was integrated and work on the trickier problems.  Your problem-solving skills and logical way of thinking were a big asset to our project. It was also inspiring for me to see you trying new things not only with the code for our project but with your development tools. Not only are the new colors in your command line super awesome, but I think that if you continue to look into tools for development like that, it will continue to increase your coding efficiency in the future. The biggest thing you could work on is the organization of your CSS. Although the CSS that you worked on for our project presented the content great, there were a couple of times when you repeated properties or selectors (like having two places where 'h2' is selected). If you come up with a certain way that you always write CSS, I think it could make it cleaner and easier to read, like your JavaScript already is. Thanks, Katie"


#### 2doBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/t6r6l5/2DoBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

2doBox's goal was to take a code base from somebody else's Ideabox and expand upon the functionality and add features while also refactoring the code. 

Evaluation Comments:
Lot of redundancy and duplication in CSS. Sloppy CSS. Obvious that JS took a priority and was what they were most interested in it. Lots of interesting approaches and solutions in JS. UI redesign is not effective. Needs a lot of work and tidying.
Mind the details: spacing and indentation inconsistencies need to be caught before you push to master.

## D: Professional Skills: 
Turing places an important emphasis on the development of so-called 'soft skills' and thereby professional development as a whole. Gear up sessions helped direct that broad focus into more specific subsets of skills to be developed. 

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)
Growth Mindset provided a sense of determination and some guiding principles towards learning new and difficult concepts early on at Turing. For me, as someone who sometimes struggles with design and spacial concepts, growth mindset was an important concept which I frequently revisited when I was feeling like time invested in said concepts was not leading to better understanding of concepts. This perseverance eventually led to success in these areas.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)
Getting better at difficult things addressed the challenge of overcoming challenged as it pertains to your mindset and efficacy as a learner.  This session served as an important reminder to limit external challenges while pursuing something that should be as all consuming as Turing often is. This session also provided a reminder to break down complex problems in order to not be discouraged by what might be an overwhelming task. 

#### Dealing with Difference: Introverts and Extroverts
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)
This session provided a reminder to the variety of different personality types which exist at Turing, but also that most people exist towards the middle of the spectrum. Given the timing of this session - prior to our first paired project - it served as an incredibly useful reminder to take a healthy neutrality to the initial relationship with any person in a collaborative environment. 

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)
Debugging the gender gap was a powerful reminder to the continued challenges towards providing a level playing field in terms of encouraging people of all backgrounds to pursue coding as a professional and the relavant obstacles which presently exist. Further, it gave a sense of the difficulties which marginalized groups still face in the workforce. As members of a community which strives towards broad inclusion this served as an excellent catalyst to go be a voice in the room which will always speak up in support of healthy work environments.

#### Case Study with Mod 4: Transhumanism
The session I attended lead by Mod 4 students was an excellent introduction to transhumanism as a subject. The leading students did a good job facilitating discussion of Transhumanism which allowed members of the session to gain awareness of the variety of different perspectives on the subject. I appreciated the way in which the session was structured and also the passion of those involved had towards exploring various benefits and concerns of different applications of transhuman technology.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
As a Mod 1 student, my contributions towards the broader community were somewhat limited. I appreciated the time spent in posse and with students from FE mod 2 as an introduction to how I may later be able to give back to the community. Within my module, I frequently took it upon myself to reach out to others in order to make it clear that I was willing and eager to help if they were struggling. I look forward to continuing to do this when possible as well as expanding my contributions going forward.
