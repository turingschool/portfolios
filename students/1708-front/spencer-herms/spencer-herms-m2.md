# Spencer Herms - M2 Portfolio
 
## Areas of Emphasis
 
My goal for this module was to improve my JavaScript skills and learn new frameworks such as React and Canvas.

## A: End of Module Assessment
 
  
## B: Individual Work & Projects
 
This module's solo projects were Sorting Suite and CompleteMe.
 

### Sorting Suite
 
GitHub URL: https://github.com/PreciseSlice/sorting-suite

Original Assignment: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html
 
Sorting suite introduced us to the basic computer science concepts of sorting algorithms. We went over the history, strengths and limitations of various algorithms. We also went over the performance and the concept of big O.

### Complete Me
 
GitHub URL: https://github.com/PreciseSlice/complete-me
 
Original Assignment: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html

Complete me introduced the stunts too different data structures including binary tree, linked list and a trie.  Students build their own tries which functioned as an autocomplete for an input.  The project was then packaged and imported to later projects.
 

### Complete Me Scores

### Evaluator: Leta

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality


### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP


### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.


### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints



## Group Work & Projects
 
This module's paired projects were Game Time and Weathrly
 
### Game Time
 
GitHub URL: https://github.com/julieahawkins/game-time

Original Assignment: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html

Game Time was our first venture in HTML canvas and using ES6 concepts. In Game Time we made extensive use of classes and wrote robust testing suites. 
 

### Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
### Instructor: Nathaniel

### Functional Expectations

* 3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing
* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESlint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints




 ### Weathrly
 
 GitHub URL: https://github.com/rennmatthewp/mr-sh-weathrly

 Original Assignment: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html
 
Weathrly introduced the React framework, API calls as well as the Jest and Enzyme testing framework.

 ## D: Professional Skills
 
This module gave us the opportunity to further develop our ability to work in teams in addition to contributing to the broader Turing community. Some of my reflections from this mod can be found here: https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1708-f/spencer_herms.md).

## E: Community Participation
 
### Playing a Part
 
Thought this mode I partook in the Turning community as much as possible.  I attended many events and showed my partner and I’s Game Time project in the code fair.   I made myself available each day at lunch during the first 4 weeks of the mod for pairing sessions.  I made an effort to help others and answer questions whenever I could. 

## Final Review

### Outcome

Repeating (and CRUSHING) mod 2!
