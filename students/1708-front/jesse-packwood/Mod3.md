## Jesse Packwood Mod3 Portfolio
#### Areas of Emphasis

This mod was the full leap into attacking problems and errors almost completely on my own. I started to explore topics that weren't covered in class and implementing new ideas that I found on my own. I've put an emphasis on improving my design skills and increasing my understanding of user experience.

Playing a Part
