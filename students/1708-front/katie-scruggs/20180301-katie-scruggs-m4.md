## [30 Day Action Plan](https://gist.github.com/katiescruggs/8bf6bb081bb73e2af6716f2c12e943ce)

## Struggles

During my first week of Mod 4, I was faced with presenting at 1801 Comp Night on Thursday and submitting my first ever backend project on Friday. This set the tone for my biggest struggle throughout Mod 4: time management and and task-switching. With the coursework and job applications, cold outreach meetings, etc, it was difficult for me to know what I should be focusing on at any given time. Unfortunately this indecision sometimes led to paralysis, where I would be worried about several things but not taking action on any of them. As the mod progressed, I got better at choosing one thing to focus on and making progress on it even though other things were on my mind.

Luckily, I still accomplished what I needed to get done during Week 1, even though I cut things closer than I would have liked. I am happy with the presentation I gave at Comp Night, and my Palette Picker was really not as bad as I thought it would be when I was working on it.

## Biggest Accomplishment

My biggest accomplishment this module was our 10-hour final assessment. During the Mod 3 final assessment, I let my nerves get to me a little bit and felt like I underperformed even though I passed. During this final, I felt calm and confident that I could accomplish what I needed to in the time allotted. I'm really proud of the final product and that I was able to complete a backend and frontend application in only 10 hours.

## Backend Development

Learning backend development was interesting for me, but it confirmed my decision to focus on frontend development at Turing. My favorite part of creating servers is making helpful error messages, which I think speaks to the fact that my interest lies in interacting with users.

## Capstone

I have been a regular of the Code for Denver Meetup since the beginning of Mod 2, and so I decided to do a capstone that could transition into an open source app for the community after it was evaluated. The Humane League is a nonprofit that aims to reduce the suffering of farm animals, and they had pitched several project ideas to Code for Denver, but no one had volunteered to take them on yet. I decided to create a volunteer action app for them as my capstone at Turing. Working with clients at The Humane League was a great experience. They gave me really clear deliverables and I loved creating a product that will really be used out in the world.

## What's Next for Katie Scruggs?

In an ideal world, I would find a developer position that allows me to work on a product connected to the public sector solving interesting front-end problems like displaying data elegantly and making applications easy for users to use. I hope to become a senior developer in a few years. If I don't find a perfect position, I am interested in any position that allows me to keep learning and growing so that I can become a proficient developer. Wherever I end up, I am leaving Turing knowing how to approach problems and how to learn new things. I also leave with the knowledge that I really like programming, so I know it is only a matter of time before I find a good job fit!
