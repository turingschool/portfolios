## Areas of Focus

In this Mod, I focused on strengthening my understanding of abstract data structures while we learned about linked lists, binary trees, and prefix trees. Although I missed having a front end, I feel much more confident in working with data structures now that I've worked on these projects. Near the end of this mod, I worked on applying my understanding of HTML and JavaScript to React. It was fun to learn a new framework, and I think that knowing React will make more complicated projects much easier to implement in the future.

### Projects

#### Sorting Suite

For this project, I wrote sorting algorithms that sorted arrays with bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort. This was good practice for becoming comfortable with algorithms, and I also learned a lot about testing.

Evaluation Scores and Comments: Pass

#### Complete Me

For this project, I created a prefix trie data structure that was populating with an array of words from a dictionary file. This project taught me a lot about data structures that are based on objects linked together (including linked lists and binary trees). It was cool to package this project up into an NPM module, which showed me how I can import programs into other programs to add functionality.

#### Weathrly

This project was a challenge for me because I was working individually. One thing that I definitely want to improve on with my next individual project is planning better. When I work with others, I create specific plans for what I will accomplish when and stay organized. Because I was working by myself on this project, I did not keep myself as accountable with cutting the project into small pieces and finishing them on schedule. Despite organizational challenges, I am proud of myself for completing this project. I learned so much about React, testing in React, and importing NPM modules.

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### Game Time

This project was really fun for me. I learned object-oriented programming while making a game that I was intersted in creating. I had an awesome partner, and we created a really cool game that we got to show in Code Fair.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
One of my goals this mod was to encourage more leadership from within my cohort. Rather than taking such an active and vocal leadership role as an SAB member, I wanted to be a more "behind-the-scenes" leader, where I enabled others to make decisions and let their ideas be heard. I think this went well as different people led the retros this mod, and I think this allowed other people in my cohort to feel involved in the decisions that affect our cohort. I spent time with Mod 1 during this inning, coming into their room for 30 minute intervals, which I think helped them feel comfortable reaching out to us. One part of community involvement that I wanted to focus on this mod was to engage with the tech community outside of Turing as well as within. I was able to attend three Code for Denver meetups and go to the Tech Jobs Fair. This trend of outside engagement is something that I want to continue in Mod 3 even though I know that will be busier than Mod 2.

## Final Review

### Notes

Keep up the great work! Great leadership and hustle this mod. Continue that in 3!

### Outcome

Promote to Mod 3
