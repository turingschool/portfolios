# Hugh Hartigan Mod 3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In Mod 3 I made an immense effort to push myself to the limit and grapple with as much material as I could. While this mod was incredibly difficult and work intensive, I think that it was hands-down my strongest performance at Turing thus far. I think that having the opportunity to work on a few projects on my own pushed me to solve problems in a way I would never have imagined and helped to develop my own unique coding style. I also wanted to become better at SASS and used it in every single project this mod, which has expedited the learning process and greatly improved my styling.

##### Evaluation:

### Evaluator: Christie
### Students: Hugh Hartigan
### Comments: Great job in splittng out all of the fetch requests! Overall, code looks super clean! Great use of variables in scss. Think about refactoring fetchs into a higher order function. 

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.


### Code Quality

4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.

### CSS/Design

4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.


### Testing

4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow

4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren’t reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

### Personal Project - Our Planet

* [FE GitHub URL](https://github.com/HartiganHM/our-planet)
* [BE GitHub URL](https://github.com/HartiganHM/our-planet-be)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

##### Evaluation:

### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Code Quality

- 4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers. Developer uses middleware. Actions and reducers are clean. At least one container is reused.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear-Up Reflections:

#### Microagressions

* I think this gear-up was one of the best during my time at Turing. Though I was in a small group with no one I knew very well, the space provided was safe and each person in my group was willing to share and comfortable talking. I feel like discussions such as these don't happen often enough and I felt as though a weight was lifted coming out of the gear-up. I would love more gear-ups such as this one. I also think the way the gear-up was structured (ie in the Vault with small group tables) facilitated discussion much better than any gear-up I've done in Clarke Hall.

#### Attention Economy

* The topic of this gear-up was something I thought was very important, but I don't think the discussion was directed very well. The video presented was interesting and gave a lot of talking points to consider. However, the bulk of discussion ended up divulging into a debate as to whether social media was a waste of time or not. Some students started shaming people who were 'addicted to social media' and I don't feel the instructor curt-tailed this at all, which may have isolated other students. Though I realize that people have strong opinions, I don't think these comments were made with other peoples feelings in mind.

#### Mod-4: Jobs from Blogs

* The gear-up I attended that was lead by Mod-4 students was really incredible. I think all of the advice was useful and each of the presenters had a lot of different insight to provide. More than any other gear-up that I've participated in that was student lead, I think this group did the best job at engaging with each of the students. Additionally, they made a unique channel specific to `jobs-from-blogs`, which I think will be really useful moving forward.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod I made a bigger effort to help students in cohorts below me. For the first few weeks of the mod, I attended Iron-FE Monday through Wednesday and lead one session each week. This didn't happen in weeks four and five, but, even so, I made sure to reach out to Mod-2 and Mod-1 to see if they had anything they needed help with. Additionally, I reached out more and more to my peers to help them with code review, especially with their projects. In Mod-4, I want to continue to be a mentor for incoming FE students and want to continue leading Iron-FE to ensure participation is strong.
