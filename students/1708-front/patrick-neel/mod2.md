### GameTime 

* [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/HartiganHM/game-time)
* [Original Assessment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

GameTime was our first project of the mod, and it introduced us to object oriented programming, and html canvas. It was cool to have the creative liberties to take a game and give it your own personal touch.

#### Comments: 

Functional Expectations

4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors
User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

###Complete Me

* [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/patneel87/complete-me)
* [Original Assessment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

Complete Me was a unique project that made use of widely used computer science alogtorithms to make an autocomplete. This project was tough for me. It was hard to conceptualize at times what was going on. It took a lot of effort, but eventaully I was able to grasp the concepts of what was going on, and make something that was really cool.

#### Comments:

1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
2. Test-Driven Development

// finish select test

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

### Weatherly

* [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/patneel87/weatherly)
* [Original Assessment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Weatherly was our last project of the mod. Also our first project where we used api's and React which was very tough at times, but the end result was very rewarding of how it turned out. Testing React proved to be especially difficult and something I want to imporve upon in the future.

Comments:

Missing small pieces of usability like keyboard navigation
Testing is a little shaky; test that state is changing and pull in actual expected values rather than just checking that the html element exists
Great UI!
Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface

4ish - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

HTML Style

3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

JavaScript / React Style

3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

Workflow

3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints

### Community Participation

I paired with mod1 students, and helped classmates when I could answer questions. Hugh and I also presented our game at code fair to rave review from the general public. Also attending guest speakers on Fridays and reaching out to other mods with questions or help.


### Outcome
