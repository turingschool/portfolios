## Areas of Emphasis

For this first module I wanted to gain a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery so I could move on to Mod2 with a solid foundation.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod, to help us master HTML and CSS, we were given three static comp to recreate. Also, for our first project, we built a website called NumberGuesser. 

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jdursema/NumberGuesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was my first project at Turing. For the project we had to build an online game that would allow the user to guess a number between 1 and 100. Looking back at it now, it sees so simple, but at the time it felt impossible. 

For this first project, I got a mix of advanced beginner and proficients. The JavaScript was solid, however, my CSS and HTML code weren't formated correctly. I was missing a lot of indentations making my code difficult to read. The title also didn't line up with the rest of the website. 

Design Recreation- Advanced Beginner/Proficient

HTML- Advanced Beginner

CSS- Advanced Beginner

JavaScript- Proficient

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We had three group projects this module: LinkedList, IdeaBox, and ToDoBox.

#### LinkedList

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jdursema/LinkedList)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

For the LinkedList project, my partner and I had to create a website that keeps a list of all the websites the user wishes to read. The user can then mark each site they've read. LinkedList was the first time I used jQuer, GitHub and worked with a partner at Turing.

Our jQuery was easy to follow and we implimented ARIA roles really well. 

### Scores:
Comp Recreation: Proficient

HTML: Proficient/Exceptional

CSS: Proficient

jQuery: Proficient

GitHub: Exceptional

Pairing/Collaboration: Proficient


### Feedback from partner (Spencer): 
  "Julie, we worked well together and I am very happy with the result of the project. I found we communicated effectively and feel we both contributed in meaningful ways. Overall, I thought the project went smoothly and I am very proud of what we accomplished together.
  When we first started planning we agreed to not begin the project until our next meeting. When we started the session on Sunday you showed me the work you had already done. This left me feeling left behind and without a say in the base of our project.
  If you begin independently working on a solution while the group is discussing a problem, it is difficult to know what direction you are heading and what solutions you are trying to implement. This happened at times during pairing sessions while the group was collaborating on a problem.
You did excellent work creating the function that got the number counters working.  Your decision to make the number counter graphic interface on the right pane, simple and straightforward was great design.
  At first you seemed hesitant to use jQuery in our project, however, you transitioned to using it very well. Even though we did not have a lot of experience you were willing to learn and try new approaches.  The end result was a successful project while we both reinforced a new concept.
  Thank you for all of the work and effort you put into our project."

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jdursema/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

IdeaBox is a site where users can write down their ideas, rate them, and save them for later. This project implimented local storage. 

Evaluator's Comments:
Design is spot on!
No search functionality/filtering and console logs/comments that need deleted
Good commits and use of feature branches
Add form and labels for input fields

### Scores:
HTML: Advanced Beginner/Proficient

CSS: Proficient

JavaScript/jQuery: Proficient

GitHub: Proficient

Pairing: Advanced Beginner

Feedback from Partner (Jeff):
"Julie did a great job tackling the challenging local storage javascript. Which allowed me to focus on improving my CSS/HTML skill set which was much appreciated. We could've done better communicating issues as they came up to resolve them more quickly. No doubt that project was challenging for everyone and I'm really grateful Julie always remained professional. We both had moments when we just needed to take a walk or discuss things privately and she always did so in a cool calm manner. In future projects, I'd encourage her (and me) to think about how to better maintain an up to date master by completing code reviews and merging pull requests so everyone is working with the current updates, which will help avoid merge conflicts. We're both at the beginning at perhaps one of the the most challenging experiences we've ever encountered and I can't wait to see how we progress together."


#### ToDoBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jdursema/ToDoBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

For this project, my partner and I had to take another groups IdeaBox and change the code to make the site function as a to do list.

Evaluator's comments:
had a bit of functionality to wrap up from ideabox, good job getting it implemented!
"It does a lot of f-ing things" - Maria, on the project :D
nice UI tweaks, used a dropdown for Importances, obvious care and thought put into additional features. Well done!
great teamwork
a few indentation issues in HTML

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

Unlike most people in our mod, I had never heard of a 'growth mindset. After IdeaBox, I felt really frustrated and annoyed that I didn't understand Local Storage. The growth mindset session really helped me after that because i just kept reminding myself that 1) people learn at different rates and 2) you don't understand it YET (but if you keep working hard, you will). The next week we had to work on ToDo Box (which is a pivot project from ideabox) and local storage, objects, and arrays started to make sense (which was a FANTASTIC feeling).

### Gear Up
#### StrengthsFinder Reflection

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_reflection_session.md)

My results from strength finder were really interesting. Before coming to Turing, I was a pretty quite and reserved person, however, two of my strengths revolve around working well with people (relator and individualization). Through pairing, I've been able to utalize these skills.


### Gear Up
#### Learning to Pair

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md)

Personally, I think this lesson is the most critical at Turing. For IdeaBox, I didn't do a DTR and although I still think I would have struggled with the project, I think it would have helped a lot if my partner and I had done a DTR before starting the project. DTRs help maintain a professional relationship.

### Gear Up
#### Feedback

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/feedback_i.md)

Everyone talks about how important it is to be able to be able to be coachable and take criticism, but no one actually talks about how to do it. This lesson was really helped me understand how to give better feedback. I'm often to nice during my feedback because I don't want to offend anyone, but that isn't helping the other person.

### Gear Up
#### Feedback

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_and_storytelling.md)

I really liked the storytelling GearUp. I felt I was better prepared because I had made a video as part of the interview process. I still need to work on figuring out where I want my story to end up.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

For this mod, I focused on getting to know the people within my cohort. It's been great working with other people, getting to know their strengths, and getting to struggle together. Also, I really enjoyed getting to know the people in my posse. Although, we mostly just hung out, it was great getting advice from people in the upper mods.
