E: Community Participation

Playing a Part: 
I had the opportunity to pair with a lot of the Mod1 students. It was great to see how they approached projects differenty than me and it helped reinforced some lessons that I learned in Mod1. I also got to go to IronFE which was great and really helped me understand array prototypes.  


## Final Review: 

I learned so much this mod, and towards the end, I think I started to become more confident in my programing abilities. I started to really enjoy doing array prototype problems. 

### Notes

We loved your energy and enthusiasm! Great work this mod, keep it up

### Outcome

Promote to Mod 3
