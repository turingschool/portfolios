Passed


## B: Individual Work & Projects

- Guess a number between the specified range (default: 0-100)
- Levels 1-5: Range will expand by -10, +10.
- Levels 6+: Range will expand by -20, +20.
- Presss enter to submit guess.
- Press escape to clear guess input.
- Enter custom Min and Max values to tailor the game to yourself. (Editing the Min or Max after the game has started will reset the game)

#### Number Guesser

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

##### Project Description

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. The game should have an input for guessing a number, and 2 more inputs for changing the min/max number range. It should have 2 buttons, one for submitting a guess, and another for clearing the guess input. When a guess is submitted, the game should provide feedback that the guessed number is either too low, too high, or guessed correctly. The submit button should be disabled and only become enabled when a valid guess has been entered into the guess input field. After each correct guess, the min/max number range should expand by 10 in both directions.

##### Evaluation Comments

It was so clear that Dave had a blast working on this. He tried all sorts of things and experimented a lot and made great progress through the phases of the project. His priority was experimentation and trying new things, and I feel this was a successful project. Having said that, because this was a "try new things" approach for him, the code was sloppy in places and needed a pass to clean it up. Given his understanding of the material and willingness to try things out, I expect that he will work hard to write more concise, clean code moving forward.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Foto Finder
This project expanded upon our jQuery skills. We had to build a photo gallery that would populate photo cards to the page from a pre-defined photos directory. Each card would have the ability to be deleted or favorited.

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/foto-finder.html)

##### Project Description
Build a photo gallery page with 2 inputs at the top for creating a title and description of the photo, a file chooser for selecting a photo from the predefined photos directory, and a save button for adding the selected photo to the page. Each photo should be displayed in a card with its corresponding title and description along with buttons for deleting the card or favoriting the card. When a card is favorited, it should change positions to the front of the list. The save button should be disabled until both input fields are filled out and an image file has been selected.

##### Partner Feedback
"I really enjoy being your partner for this project. We worked great together, and finished our project in time. I admire your CSS skills and learned a lot from the advice you gave me, specially about how to use media queries. I also appreciate that you were receptive of my contributions and advice, and that you share a lot of important resources and articles, which I take seriously because they improve my code significantly. Regarding opportunities to improve, at the beginning of our project, you added contributions to the CSS file on you own, which I would love to have worked with you to get a better understanding. However, the next day, you were able to explain the changes very well, and our communication improved greatly throughout the week. Overall, we were able to balance the workload of the project, but we could both improve on involving one another to learn more from our strengths and skills."

### IdeaBox
This project incorporated localStorange into the mix. We had to use our HTML, CSS, and jQuery/JS knowledge to build a dynamic list where we could enter ideas. Each idea would have an editable title and body, a quality level, and the ability to delete ideas. Ideas should also be added to localStorage and persist through page refreshes.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dstock48/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

##### Project Description
Build a webpage with an input section at the top, and a section below where new ideas can be added to a list. Each idea should have a unique identifier, a title, body, quality level with up/down vote buttons, and a delete button. All ideas should remain on the page after a page refresh, deleted ideas should not come back after page refresh, and edited an edited title/body/quality should persist between page refreshes.

##### Partner Feedback
"Thanks for being such an awesome partner to work with. I think we worked very well together and I can't wait for the opportunity to collaborate with you on future projects. I really enjoyed our first session when I was driving and you were navigating while working on our HTML and CSS. I learned a ton of neat tips and tricks that I have been using since. I believe it would have been beneficial to do a little more planning in the earlier stages. Perhaps next time, if we wrote some psuedo code, we could avoid some of the difficult refactoring issues we ran into towards the end of the project. However, I am really happy with the product and would gladly work with you on future projects."

### 2DoBox
This project was our first real experience adding/editing code from someone else's codebase. We were tasked with taking another group's ideaBox project, fixing bugs/finishing incomplete features, and adding new features to turn it into a to-do list.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dstock48/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

##### Project Description
Fix any bugs, finish any incomplete features from the ideaBox project requirments. Add the ability to mark tasks as completed, hide/show completed tasks, change quality level to importance level and add new importance levels. Add filter buttons for importance levels. Only show 10 most recent tasks with a button to show more.

##### Partner Feedback
"Dave, thanks for being such a great partner! I learned a lot working with you and you had a lot of ideas on how to approach things that I never would have thought of. I appreciated that you communicated with me on everything and as a result our project ran smoothly and we reached all of our DTR goals! As far as coaching I encourage you to do some psuedo coding to explain where you are heading before you start trying to change things in several areas. There was one moment where I felt a little lost on where your thought process was with approaching one of the problems and I think it would have been helpful to pseudo code your thoughts to me. However, that's partially my fault for not speaking up sooner. Thanks again for being a great partner and hope to work with you again soon!"

## D: Professional Skills

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

#### Growth Mindset

* Learning to code will be a life-long commitment. As a beginner, the mountain can seem too tall and it can feel like you will never be good enough, or be able to learn so much. It is important to keep a growth mindset, and understand that you _will never_ know everything, but that you can always continue to learn and grow as the journey progresses. When somethat happens that triggers your mind back into a fixed mindset, such as comparing yourself to someone else much more experienced than you, or struggling with a coding problem, it is important to remind yourself that even though you're having trouble now, with time and practice, it can be overcome.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things / Learning & Cognitive Resources

* Very large problems can seem daunting at first, and sometimes can feel impossible. However when broken down into smaller more managable pieces, you can complete these small pieces one at a time, and before you know it you will have completed the entire project! Cognitive resources have a limit, so it is important to spend those resouces wisely. Rather than becoming pretty good at a bunch of things and spreading yourself thin, it is better to stay focused and become really good at just a few things at a time, before moving on to new things.

#### Working Styles (Intro-, Extro-, Ambi-)

* The old idea of people being either an Introvert or Extrovery has changed, as we now recognize that it is a spectrum, and that everyone lies somewhere between the 2. Depending on the context or situation, your position on the spectrum can change as well. In the tech industry, there will be a large mix of people and they will fall into all different positions on this spectrum. It is important that we understand how to work with people who are on opposite sides from us, and understand how to cater to their needs as well as how we carry ourselves in pairing situations. 

#### Storytelling and Strengths

* When we present ourselves to potential employers in interviews, or even just a meetups, we will neeed a solid "story" to tell about ourselves. Similar to the stories in our favorite movies/TV shows/books/etc, we play a role in the context of a larger story, and must frame it in such a way that whoever we are telling this story to will be compelled to root for us as the main character and be invested in our success. We must also leverage and highlight our natural strengths in these stories and how they will be an asset to the team we are looking to join.

#### Code Debugging the Gender Gap

* The documentary that we watched about the gender gap in the tech industry really highlighted just how much women have to deal with to enter, stay, and succeed in this industry. It is important that upon entering this industry, that we look our for injustices and stand up for unfair treatment towards women. Another side-point that the documentary touched on which is equally, if not more important, is the addition of computer science to all public schools in the US at an early age. Technology is expanding and will soon be incorporated into just about everything in our lives. It is critical that the next generation has at least a fundimental understanding about how the technology in their lives works, and how they can instruct computers to do what we want them to do.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Coming into Turing, I had a bit more HTML and CSS experience than most of my classmates. Whenever anyeone was stuck with something, I always made sure to come help, and share my knowledge with the rest of the class. This especially came into play with Comp 3. I had essentially finished my Comp 3 challenge by Friday night, but still came into Campus Sat, Sun, and stayed late Mon and Tues helping all of my classmates and anwering any questions they had about their HTML/CSS, and helping to figuring out what was causing any problems they were running into.
