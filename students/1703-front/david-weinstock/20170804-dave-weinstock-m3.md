#### Evaluation Scores
- Specification Adherence: 3
	- The application completes 5 iterations
- Code Quality: 3
	- Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.
- PropType Implementation: Pass
	- Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### SWAPI-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danielbucket/swAPI)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

#### Description
An exercise in ascync JavaScript, making multiple API calls and using Promise.all to render data to the screen from multiple API's at the same time

#### Evaluation Scores
- PASS

### Movie-Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/noetic97/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

#### Description
Our first project using Redux and React Router. Using the Movie Database API, we displayed the top 20 new movie releases on a page, and managed user logins so that users could mark new releases as favorites.

#### Evaluation Scores
- Specification Adherence: 4
	- The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

- Redux Architecture: 3.5
	- At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

- Routing: 3
	- Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

- JavaScript Style: 3.5
	- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

- Testing: 3
	- Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

Workflow: 3
- The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microagressions

Often micro-aggressions are unintentional and subconscious. Looking back at even some recent conversations, I can identify a few times that I had said something that could be percieved as a microaggression. The best thing we can do to prevent this is to get better at identifying them at stopping/correcting ourselves before they come out. When observing a micro-aggression between others, it could be good to chime in and let the victim knkow that they are welcomed and valued, to help them 'brush off' the micro-aggression that they just received. 

#### Allyship

The Turing poopulation includes a wide variety of people belonging to many different demographics. To be an ally, it is important to recognize each of those demographics, understand their struggles, and actively take steps when possible to ensure that they are welcomed and respected.

#### The Attention Economy

With smart phones, watches, TVs, etc.. we are almost always connected in some way. The software companies that develope some of the apps that we use most, are designing their apps in such a way that the apps grab and keep our attention as long as possible. This is because their revenue model relies upon us staying on their app/website for as long as possible. Attention has now become our most precious resource, and these app companies are using highly sophisticated tactics to 'trick' us into handing our attention over to them. As developers we should keep this in mind as we work on our own applications, and think about the ethical ramifications.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During this module I have continued to help those in the modules below me. While I have not had officially scheduled pairings, I have often stopped in the Mod 2 classroom to chat with them and answer any kinds of questions that they have on the project they are working on. In our posse, I was also able to help some of the FE Mod 1 students with practicing their mythical creatures.
