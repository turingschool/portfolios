### Gear Up

#### Psych of UX/UI

This Gear Up was presented by myself along with Cole, Juan, JC, and Justyna. We focused on the principals of Design Thinking, and the importance of getting feedback from your users early and often to give direction to your UX and UI. We tried to cater to back-end students as well, speaking about how when designing an API, it is important to take into account the user experience of the developer that might end up using your API.

## E: Community Participation
