# (James Sullivan - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In mod 2, I wanted to deepen my understanding of javascript programming.  I wanted to build on my foundation gained in mod 1 and become more comfortable programming.  I also wanted to learn React basics.  In addition to those goals, I wanted to perform well in all of my projects and generally succeed through hard work and practice.  I feel I met these goals.

* 4 - Zero complaints

## Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jsullivan5/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

  In Game Time, we were assigned to build a javascript game using pure javascript and HTML canvas.  We chose to build Frogger.

# Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
# Instructor:
# Comments:

- some long functions
- could merge some classes together / move responsibility
- for the most part i liked the design 

## Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

### User Interface

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

## Weatherly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jsullivan5/js-gg-weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

  Weatheryly required us to build a weather application using React.  We populated our data with calls to a weather API based on user input.

# Instructor Evaluation Points: weathrly
# Instructor: Nathaniel
# Comments:

## Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

## HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

## CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

## JavaScript / React Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

## Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

## Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Empathy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

This gear up made me realize how disparate our backgrounds can be.  Hearing from people at Turing talk about their backgrounds and dispositions made me more aware of how empathy fits into the workplace and life in general.  Everyone is influenced by their own accumulation of experiences.  Being aware of this and able to sympathize with others is critical to the harmony of the team dynamicm in the workplace and in the broader realms of life.

### Gear Up
#### Parable of the Polygon

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

This gear up had us consider how biases, even if unintentional affect our interactions with one another.  I realized that often times, biases can be so deeply ingrained that they are often unbenounced to even the most well intentioned.  After confronting this reality, I realized that doing my part means I should maintain awareness of this and become an advocate for others.  Being active in this pursuit means not just being aware, but making a concerted effort to be inclusive to all sorts of poeple and being thoroughly conscious of how my worldview affects my interactions with others.


### Gear Up
#### Mod 4 Leads

This gear up focused on how social media can be a potent and potential insidious force in modern life.  Due to the addictive nature of social media, we discussed how we as developers can chose to develop applications that use this force responsibly.  I often think about the dark side of technology and how we can be manipulated to do certain things.  After this gear up, it finally hit home that when I graduate I will have the tools to be a positive agent of change in this realm.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

In this mod, I did everything I could to be an active member in the community.  I often receive help from my classmates and fellow students.  So it is important for me to feel that I contribute whenever possible.  I provided aid to my classmates whenver possible.   It could be help with code, a talk about stress levels, or just bringing a bit of light into someone's day with a joke during particularly difficult times.  I stayed late a couple times to help classmates work on their projects even after I was done and ready to go home.  My classmates have helped me tremendously.  I just try to reciprocate the best I can.  
I also paired with several mod 1 students throughout this term.  I was always purposeful in the direction I gave them, trying to coach them towards the answers and not just give it to them.  I tried to be positive with them as well.  With students wrestling with their programming confidence (as I did), I would reassure them that they are doing well and just need to keep practicing.  I even got some feedback from a student I worked with that told me this positivity and reassurance helped them overcome some barriers in their education.  Once again, I recieved this kind of aid and felt compelled to pay it forward.

I participated in the Armstrong posse this mod.  We explored blockchain technology and attempted to educate ourselves on this new and exciting field.  I was an advocate of this technology and tried to share my excitement with other students through keeping the discussion going outside of the posse meetings.
