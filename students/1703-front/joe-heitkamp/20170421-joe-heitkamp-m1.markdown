# Joe Heitkamp - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to learn the fundamental skills of HTML, CSS, and Javascript while also learning how to better learn.  While I felt that I already knew how to work well with others, I was pleasantly surprised at how effective and eye-opening the pairing experience was throughout the inning.  While I feel a little slow at working through some of the concepts we covered, I do know that my learning style is methodical and I am confident in the knowledge I've gained.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Dog-Party, Number-Guesser, Javascript-foundations, and the static comps were progressively more complex projects designed to test and strengthen our skills as we progressed through the inning

#### Dog-Party

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/noetic97/dog-party)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-1/html-1.html)

Dog party was a great introduction to HTML and CSS both structurally and semantically.  It was essentialy our first static comp.


#### Number-Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/noetic97/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser is an application that has users attempting to guess a number, initially randomly generated between 1 and 100. The user is told if the guess it is too low or too high until  guessing the right number. this was our introduction to vanilla JS.

Notes:

*  Refactor header to remove that extra markup (the div)
*  Potential refactor in button containers - maybe don't need them, or not both of them
*  Use percentages for box model props if you want relative units of measure. Save the em's for fonts and be sure to set a base font-size on your body
*  Consider refactor on the big if/else, research a switch statement in js

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Foto Finder

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/noetic97/foto-finder)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/foto-finder.html)

### Description:

Foto-finder allowed a user to grab an image from their computer and append a title and caption to that image and then present it in a snazzy card format in the browser.  This project was completed in vanilla JS and was a great introduction to paired programming.

### Notes:

Evaluator: Louisa

GREAT JOB. Did all sort of neat extras, had a modal so you can see a bigger version of the image. So many neat things!

### Feedback to me:

I really enjoyed working with you on this project. You were very kind, easy to work with, and did a fantastic job with the responsive design. Not only that, but I could tell you were really pushing yourself to truly understand how everything fit together. I also really liked that you took the time to understand the code I wrote as well. I understand that there were still a couple of items we probably needed to clarify on the Javascript portion. If we work together again, I would like to do a better job making sure we both take turns writing parts of the application. However, given our time constraint, I think our project turned out very well.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/christielynam/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

### Description:

IdeaBox took the ideas from foto finder, i.e. making a card with user input, and then upped the game with the use of local storage.  This was the first project that I worked on that used jQuery.  It was a great mix of reinforcement from the previous project and new skill learning with local storage.

### Feedback to me:

Joe... working with you on IdeaBox was an "ideal" pairing experience. I appreciated the time we put into creating a meaningful DTR and strictly sticking to it. I feel like we accomplished all of the goals we set out in our DTR. We both walked away with a better understanding of JavaScript and successfully implemented ARIA roles into our HTML. I also appreciated the fact that we frequently communicated about what we had completed, what we were working on, and what still needed to be done. You also did a great job of keeping us on track and prioritizing our unresolved issues. I know we went into this project a little scared of arrays, and as a result, somewhat avoided them. In the future, I think we both could benefit from stepping out of our box and being willing to try something new and challenging. Overall, I was extremely proud of the work we completed and our style of collaboration. I thoroughly enjoyed working with you!!!

#### 2DoBox-Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/noetic97/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

### Description:

2DoBox focused on refactoring another team's code base from ideabox and adding several new functions.  This was a great practice to familiarize ourselves with a code base that is not our own.  It allowed me to see how other devs might approach a problem.  This project also helped me better understand SRP.

### Feedback to me:

Joe and I worked together on our last group project of the MOD.  We used Waffle.io for the first time and we were both very pleased with how it helped us stay organized and on track.  Joe and I were able to work both side by side and ping-pong code, without any Github mishaps.  Joe is a fantastic coder, and I really enjoyed that he approached the problems from a different angle and we were able to work together to come up with the best option for the project.  The only thing that I feel that we could have handled better was reaching out for help earlier when we got stuck.  We were able to work through the issues we were having with the code, but we could have spent less time beating our heads against the wall.

## D: Professional Skills
I found the professional skill development focus to be fantastic even if it felt like another item being piled onto an already full plate.

### DTR

* [https://github.com/christielynam/idea-box/blob/master/dtr.md] (idea-box with Christie Lynam)

### Feedback:

Kristi Green -
Joe,  I am so happy to have met you!! We have paired on many in-class assignments and we work very well together.  Bouncing ideas or questions off of each other has been very helpful for me in solidifying concepts we are learning and I look forward to working with you as we move forward.

### Gear Up
#### Growth-mindset

Growth mindset has a huge impact on me and I found myself often examining my thoughts to see if they are fixed or not.  This is a great way to kick off the inning and set the stage for a difficult process.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

This gear up was perfectly timed and was incredibly helpful in fighting a lurking impostor syndrome.  A couple of ideas that really resonated were the ideas of being surrounded by darkness and as you learned, the light would slowly turn on and illuminate a broader space around you.  Kathy Sierra brought up some great approaches to breaking down difficult learning into simpler pieces that have been incredibly helpful.

#### Working Styles - feedback

The different ways to give feedback are incredibly helpful.  I find myself looking back at the notes after a project to make sure I am giving a proper mix of support, coaching, and constructive criticism.  The most valuable piece of this session was in setting the need for a good DTR prior to a new project.

#### Storytelling and Strength-Finder

I have a lot of experience with my personal story through years of political outreach, so I found this gearup to be redundant for me personally, but a great topic and something everyone should focus on. Applying the strength onto the personal story was a great addition that I had not really thought through beforehand.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

I found this documentary eye-opening.  I couldn't help but think about my wife, mother, and sisters and the struggles that they could face as I watched the movie.  

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I feel that it is very important to offer a helping hand whenever you can.  Multiple times through this inning, I found myself helping a cohort mate through a logic or syntax issue and while doing so, better understanding it myself.  With one of my strengths being empathy, I have been rethinking and applying a more thoughtful approach to working with people if I sense they need help but don't want to ask.  This looks like a lot of checking in with others.
