## B: Individual Work & Projects

##### I felt that I was able to dive in a little deeper on my Individual work than
##### I did my first attempt.  

#### Number Guesser

##### I created website where two users take turns guessing a number until one of them

##### I had a great time working with Nik on this project.  We created a DTR that stipulated work times and outlined our basic personal styles.  In doing so, we had an earnest conversation about our strengths, potential limitations and goals.  Nik was great at explaining things to me that I was struggling with and his relentless encouragement and positivity was greatly appreciated.  Overall, I couldn't be happier about my experience with this project and working with Nik.  We accomplished all of our goals for the week and had a great time doing it.  Going forward, Nik and I could both benefit from writing clearer code.  Chiefly, we could name our functions things that were a bit more clear and utilizing the refactoring advice we received during instructor evals.  All and all, thanks for the great experience Nik.  I learned a lot!

#### 2doBox

##### We refactored code from IdeaBox to create a website where users could keep track of their

##### It was great working with you on 2DoBox.  We were able to effectively walk through our plan of attack, set up a comprehensive list of issues on GitHub, and divvy the work evenly.  Even during the moments of frustration that came from trying to come up with a solution to a coding issue, we worked well at communicating the issue and then working through it together.  This approach helped me learn a lot through this project. In the future, it would be helpful to take the time to commit our DTR to a gist so we can check in on it as we progress.  Thankfully we were on the same page through the project, but I could see that becoming a problem if we didn't work so well together. I look forward to working with you again and definitely want to say thanks for being a great pairing partner!  We owned that project!

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Working with Extro/Intro/Ambiverts

##### I really enjoyed this gear up.  I had never heard of the term Ambibert, but after learning about the term I would say it fits me to a 'T'.  I had always looked at myself as a "Introverted/extrovert".  It was great to talk about the differences between the three, and talk about best practices for working with individuals in each group.  Technically, we are all Ambiverts, but just sit closer to extro or intro.  Not only was I able to learn something about myself, I was able to learn how to deal with others better as well.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

##### I really focused on checking in with everyone as much as I could, especially those that I knew where struggling.  I gave adivice I was I had, and paired with them when they needed help.  I was more focused on my cohort this MOD and going forward I need to make it a higher priority to support the larger Turing community.
