## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module?
I wanted a stronger grasp of array prototypes and being more confident with writing js.

## D: Professional Skills
### Gear Up

#### Empathy: 
This was an interesting gearup and my takeaway from it was including people. A lot of the stories from Emily had to do with being a woman in the 
workplace and some of the challenges that she faces and how she overcomes them. She wanted to make the community aware that this happens in real life
and that should have empathy for people and if this kind of treatment towards people is happening then you should do something about it. 
I found this to be an engaging gearup and opened up a lot of conversation. \

#### Parable of the Polygons: 
By hiring teams in which 1/3 is just like them then they aren’t going to get a lot of variety and it may become segregated. 
I think diversity quotas are valuable to have so that teams can have all different types of perspectives and backgrounds. 
If everyone is the same then your team won’t be as strong. Turing should give students the awareness that working with people different 
than you delivers a much better product. The more diverse people are working together, the more perspectives brought to the table. If everyone is 
the same then this will over time create segregation, which isn’t fun. The goals are to show you just having a small individual bias can 
lead to a large collective bias and that all it takes is a change in the perception of what an acceptable environment looks like. If we change 
our perceptions of what this looks like then we will all be stronger and less segregated. 

#### Gear Up Mod 4 Leads:
I attended the black mirror gear up which was based around how social media impacts our society. They showed a clip from
the show where social media is basically currency and how well you are liked from social media is what brings you opportunities and allows you nice things.
My group talked about how social acceptance is a huge part of what makes us happy but that it's really nice to turn off social media and not worry about 
or care about how many likes we got on some post. We talked about how it would be really scarya and sad if our societ actually got to the point of where it was in the 
show and that shoudl better spend our time on apps that matter and help our wellbeing, like meditation apps etc... rather than just killing 30 mins on facebook and not feeling
like we did anything productive with that time. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod I supported the community by joining the armstrong posse and attending and participating in all the Friday guest speakers, spikes and gearups. I went to a few IronFE sessions and I also
participated in a few lunch roulettes to get to know the other members of Turing. 


## F: Feedback
Game Time: Feedback from Krisi was in person and what was said was that she really liked the final product of our project but wished that there
had been more collaboration throughout the project. We started out strong collaborating a lot and as time went on we divided things up and worked 
separately more often to save on time and meet the deadline and she wishes we had done more things together. She also thought that I doubt myself 
more than I should and to trust my instincts and struggle longer before seeking help from others. Overall working with me on the project went well but 
wanted more time to do things together and collaborate together. At the time the feedback was given there was still 2 days left on the project
so we took a step back and made a point to finish the project doing everything together and collaborating more. 

Weatherly feedback from Evan: 
Ciara, I had a blast working with you on Weatherly. Finding out that we share some of the same traits really makes sense now.  
During the project, I felt comfortable brainstorming my thoughts with you and when things got tough, to ask your opinion. 
I look up to you in those instances where we did need help, but I did not want to ask for it. In those instances, you took 
control and found a solution by seeking help from our neighbors which proved to be very useful. If there is anything outside 
of what we learned with React, is that sometimes asking for help is the best solution. You showed me that again. 
In code, your use of syntax was superb. There were times I would be typing and all along you were correcting tags and 
functions. My feedback to you is to not forget to log when your stuck. Logging helps me a ton and if your ever feel stuck, 
give yourself a chance and use some console logs. There is definitely a fine line between how long this goes on before one 
asks for help. However, I think overall you know it well. I liked your dedication to the project. Working on the weekends r
eally helped us stay on track with a steady pace. It is nice not feeling rushed at the end when writing our tests. 
Overall, thanks for the great time. I look forward to working with you again.
