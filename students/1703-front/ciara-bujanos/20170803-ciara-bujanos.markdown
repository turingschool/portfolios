## Gear Up

### Community Gear Up: Mod 4 Leads:
I attended coding schools or coding fools and we talked about the rise of bootcamps and how that is affecting the tech industry as well as formal education. Talked about how it's as if this "trade school" will be something that replaces formal education in the future and if we think that eventually all our jobs will be automated and how that will impact developers and technology. It was interesting to think about how things will be in the next 10 years but ultimately I think it's a great opportunity for career changers.
Parable of the Polygons:

### M2 & M3 Gear Up: Being an Ally:
We talked about how we can be an ally to people who are experiencing perhaps some microaggressions on things that others might not even realize they are doing. How we can speak up and try to ask them why they feel a certain way and then offer insight on how to see both sides. I found it pretty interesting and made me think about more about things that i've heard at Turing and times when I could have spoken up but didn't because I didnt think it was that big of a deal. But it made me thing deeper about how other people might take that.

### Microaggressions:
This was kind of similar to the being and ally gear up but this was more about how we can be more aware of things we do or say without thinking about how that makes other people feel. How we can be mindful about assuming things about people based on their skin color, gender, experience... It was insightful and made me reflect on times when I've felt microagressions throughout life. 

### F: Feedback

Didn't get any from project partners. Jhun's feedback to me was to work on my confidence and that if I don't feel good about something then just write it and erase it over and over until I get it. 

Final Review

### Notes

- Go to IronFE 
    -explaining code 
    - vanilla JS
    - works on confidence and speed 

- Exercisms! 
    - logical thinking 
    - should be doing atleast 1 -2  a week.

PASS

* A: End-of-Module Assessment: 3
* B: Individual Work & Projects: 3
* C: Group Work & Projects: 3.5
* D: Professional Skills: 3.5
* E: Community Participation: 3
