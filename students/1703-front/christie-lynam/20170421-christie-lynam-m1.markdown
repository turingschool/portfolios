-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Code Challenge 1: Failed

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 1
## Evaluator: Bree
## Optional Notes:

* I would encourage you to experiment like we did w/ `event.preventDefault()` so that you can start to deconstruct and reconstruct your code in a way that helps you begin to understand how things are working. It will help build confidence and guide your learning.
* Test all the things. Console log all the lines of code you can so that you are giving yourself positive feedback throughout the course of solving the problem.
* I think writing out the steps via pseudo code would help you a lot. If you execute an outline, then breaking down the problem becomes more clear, and writing the code is a bit less intimidating/confusing as you work through the steps of your outline. 
* Good job on catching the string/integer issue
* While not proficient on this assessment, I think you can get there. You just need more time generating your own code from scratch and gaining comfort in reading, writing, debugging. 

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.

#### Conditional Logic

* __Novice:__ Can understand when an expression evaluates to true or false.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Novice:__ Can declare an object literal and define/articulate properties vs. methods for an object. Can extract values of an object's property, and assign new properties and/or reassign values of existing properties on an object.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.

#### Style

* __Novice:__ Can explain the choices made in the overall codebase and is able to articulate what every line of code is doing. Code is neatly formatted and easy to read with correct indentation.

Code Challenge 2: Failed

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 2

## Evaluator: Robbie

## Optional Notes:

* Overall, pretty good - but need more practice with array prototypes
* Not very accepting of feedback along the way when your evaluator is trying to help you...

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Proficient:__ Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

#### Conditional Logic

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is "truthy" and "falsey" in JavaScript.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

#### Arrays

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## TESTING

#### Test Comprehension

* __Advanced Beginner__: Can read through a test and understand the structure. Can make the test pass, but takes a few attempts because developer does not use error messages effectively.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DEBUGGING

#### Dev Tools/Debug Process

* __Proficient__: Uses the dev tools as their first line of defense when encountering something unexpected. Demonstrates comfort and skill using dev tools to investigate, check layout issues, console log results, and experiment solving problems before writing abundant amounts of code. Will experiment with javascript in the console to test unfamiliar concepts.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/christielynam/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Evaluator: Louisa

Optional Notes:

Great attention to detail! Very nicely done, a few spots to polish and refine but overall well executed and demonstrated a high level of understanding of all her code and could speak to all of it.

Functional Expectations

Proficient: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
HTML

Accessibility

Novice: Knows what a semantic tag is and leverages the HTML5 structural tags to organize the content of their markup.
Style

Advanced Beginner: Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
CSS

Structure of Code

Advanced Beginner: Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
Implementation

Proficient: Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.
JAVASCRIPT

Conditional Logic

Proficient: Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
Functions & Scope

Proficient: Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
DOM Manipulation

Proficient: Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
Style

Advanced Beginner: Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
DESIGN

Comp Recreation

Proficient: Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticable and/or unintuative than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

FEEDBACK FROM CIARA

“It was a pleasure working with you and I’m really proud of the final product that we came up with together. Your eagerness to try new things really came out and as a result the site presentation looked great and you got more familiar with several jQuery methods. I also appreciated that you consistently checked in with me and felt that our communication was on point. I know that in the beginning of the project you said you were feeling overwhelmed, but try not to get too frustrated and stressed and recognize that sometimes finding the solution to a problem can take hours, so don’t beat yourself up if it’s not coming straight away. It was great to see you go home and do some extra studying to have a better understanding of the material so that you could dive in deeper on the project and make lots of contributions!”

#### (IDEA BOX)

I was paired with Joe for Idea Box.

* EVALUATION SCORES NOT RECORDED

FEEDBACK FROM JOE

Christie, You were a pleasure to work with throughout the project.  I think that we used the DTR effectively in setting goals and workflows and then also used it effectively to measure our progress through the project.  If anything, we could both stand to get more specific in our DTR as we put it together.  You showed me how to effectively use the PR process and issues in GitHub and this made a world of difference in our ability to communicate throughout the project.  Thank you! Continue to push yourself when you don't understand how a function is working and continue to ask for help as you do so.  Thanks again for being a great partner who helped me better understand the tools to keep each other informed of our progress.

Github

Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

FEEDBACK FROM COLE:

Just wanted to say you were an excellent partner to work with. You were very eager and motivated to work through and understand the project. This made the experience extremely enjoyable. I really appreciated your input on how to solve the problems we encountered when refactoring and adding new features. It was really awesome when you solved the array issue using the splice prototype. Also, I really liked how you planned out the code you were writing very clearly before implementing. My advice is tell you to trust yourself and keep telling yourself that you can do it. It became very clear to me after the first day that you have a good understanding of the fundamentals. I think with just a little more practice, you will definitely get the little intricacies and timing down to a point where you will be an excellent developer. I would be happy to work with you again on a future project.

Additional Notes:

### Gear Up
#### The Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

You should always be feeling like you are growing and improving in your personal and professional life. When you start to revert to a fixed mindset, its important to stop and reflect on all of the small achievements you have made. The law of ambition.... strive for progress, not perfection.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

It's important to be aware of your learning experience and to always feel like you are learning. Reppitition is important to this process. Its also super important to take time to refill your cognitive resource bank. 

#### Different Working with Extro/Intro/Ambiverts

It's important to communicate your work style and needs to others. Everyone is different. As an introvert, I need to convey my need for space at times and that I work best if I have time to digest the information/task on my own and come back with helpful and productivesuggestions and methods.

#### Storytelling and Strengths

Its important how you put yourself out there to the rest of the world. The story you tell can have a tremendous impact on your future. My strengths (achiever, learner, responsibility, focus, and harmony) absolutely play a huge part in shaping that story. They make me who I am.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

There is a wide gender gap in this profession. It is our place to make the effort to reduce this gap. Its important to stand up to others and say something if you experience or witness discrimination.
