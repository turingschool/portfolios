### Professional Development
* Template for DTR Memo

Project: 2DPivot

Group Member Names: Kristi Green & Jason Collins

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
Kristi: Refactoring efficiently and deeper understanding of the functionality of the application
Jason: Taking feeback from Robbie on ideabox and incorporating array prototypes, intellgently implementing them to solve problemens

Goals and expectations:
Kristi:Better understanding of refactoring, functioning product, and use of array prototyypes
Jason:The process of pairing and being able to practice that with someone with different experience level.

Team strengths:
Kristi: Write organized, clean code, can learn concepts somewhat quickly if presented well.
Jason: Can explain concepts fairly well stronger on javascript vs. html and css but growing with the latter. Thoroughness, thinks of edge cases around features

How to overcome obstacles:
Kristi: Communication about any issues related to code etc.
Jason: Open minded conversations

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
Kristi:At school until 5pm, 7pm-10pm via zoom or screenhero.
Jason: Can adjust schedule to meet your availability. in person on zoom.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
Kristi: Slack, zoom, waffle.
Jason:Slack,zoom when pairing,Waffle. If i'm going too fast stop me and tell me to slow down. If partner has questions please ask for clairfication.  Avoid git conflicts.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
Kristi: Functional javascript understanding, implementing array prototypes, articulating what it is I am not understanding.
Jason:Write clean code/refactoring while writing. Logically understand very well what's happening. Desired improvement- Array prototypes.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
Kristi:Not sure at this point in time.
Jason:Just be vocal about features I want to work on to improve on. Split workload as evenly as possible. Will work when I am available so we can ensure work is split evenly as possible.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
Kristi:Just remembering workflow, use branches
Jason:Use branches, use PR's, communicate when merges are needed or when master is updated.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
Kristi:Kind, respectfull, speak to me in a respectfull tone.
Jason:Echo's my exepctations and will practice feedback methods, give specific examples,

Agenda to discuss project launch: Setup work enviornment-overview of waffle build project, setup repo, practice github workflow.
Kristi:
Jason:

Ideas:

Tools:Slack, Zoom, Waffle, GitHub,

Additional Notes:We will use Driver Navigator style

* Kristi I'd like to start off by saying that it was always a pleasure to be able to work with you. Personally, it's always been difficult for me to reach out for help and that was something that you sensed about me from the beginning. You reached out to me and offered to help me in the classroom and after. At that point I was able to recognize that you have an amazing ability that enables you to understand and work great with people. During our pairing sessions, you were extremely patient with me. You took the time to make sure that I was able to understand every line of code that we wrote and for that I appreciate you! You're a hard worker and everyone in our class could recognize this about you. I know this because it's something that everyone always said whenever your name came up. By working with you I was able to learn a lot about programming at a very quick pace. I admire your ability to understand the code and explain it thoroughly to others. You're a great person who, with no doubt in my mind, will go far at Turing and in your future career as a software developer. Thank you!

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)
#### Joe Heitkamp
* Joe,  I am so happy to have met you!! We have paired on many in-class assignments and we work very well together.  Bouncing ideas or questions off of each other has been very helpful for me in solidifying concepts we are learning and I look forward to working with you as we move forward.

#### Dave Weinstock
* Dave, I just want to say thank you for helping me out with  a few issues.  Your knowledge of css and javascript is outstanding!  Pairing with you on a few issues really helped me figure out problems I was having with things not rendering the way I wanted them to.  I think you certainly found your calling in becoming a developer!

#### Joe Heitkamp
* Kristi provided a level head and calming influence for me as I struggled incorporating new concepts into my work.  She showed both vulnerability and strength as we worked through the many stressful moments of the inning.  Working on Mythical Creatures with Kristi was a fantastic exercise and gave us both great practice at talking through our logic and code.  Kristi rocks!!!!!
