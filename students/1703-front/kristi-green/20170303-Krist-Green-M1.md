*   [Original Assignment]()

(This application used the basic understanding of html, css, and javascript for basic functionality)

(## Evaluator: Robbie

## Optional Notes:

### Functional Expectations

* __Proficient:__ Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Proficient:__ Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Proficient__ : Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

#### Implementation

* __Exceptional__ Can articulate rationale for all parts of the CSS implementation (each line of code/CSS rule) specifically in regards to the balance of: structure of code, design integrity, performance.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Conditional Logic

* __Proficient:__ Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Exceptional__ Comfortable with using callback functions where applicable. Comfortable returning collections from functions (objects, arrays).

------------------------------------------------------------------

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Proficient:__ Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* __Exceptional__ Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of JavaScript syntax, style, and refactoring. Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticable and/or unintuative than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

* Kristi I'd like to start off by saying that it was always a pleasure to be able to work with you. Personally, it's always been difficult for me to reach out for help and that was something that you sensed about me from the beginning. You reached out to me and offered to help me in the classroom and after. At that point I was able to recognize that you have an amazing ability that enables you to understand and work great with people. During our pairing sessions, you were extremely patient with me. You took the time to make sure that I was able to understand every line of code that we wrote and for that I appreciate you! You're a hard worker and everyone in our class could recognize this about you. I know this because it's something that everyone always said whenever your name came up. By working with you I was able to learn a lot about programming at a very quick pace. I admire your ability to understand the code and explain it thoroughly to others. You're a great person who, with no doubt in my mind, will go far at Turing and in your future career as a software developer. Thank you!

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)
#### Joe Heitkamp
* Joe,  I am so happy to have met you!! We have paired on many in-class assignments and we work very well together.  Bouncing ideas or questions off of each other has been very helpful for me in solidifying concepts we are learning and I look forward to working with you as we move forward.

#### Dave Weinstock
* Dave, I just want to say thank you for helping me out with  a few issues.  Your knowledge of css and javascript is outstanding!  Pairing with you on a few issues really helped me figure out problems I was having with things not rendering the way I wanted them to.  I think you certainly found your calling in becoming a developer!

(feedback to me)

#### Joe Heitkamp
* Kristi provided a level head and calming influence for me as I struggled incorporating new concepts into my work.  She showed both vulnerability and strength as we worked through the many stressful moments of the inning.  Working on Mythical Creatures with Kristi was a fantastic exercise and gave us both great practice at talking through our logic and code.  Kristi rocks!!!!!
