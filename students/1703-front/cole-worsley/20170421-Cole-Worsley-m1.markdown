## A: End of Module Assessment

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 1
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

Really well done. Has a very good handle on JS and the DOM, needs a little polish on breaking out single responsibility functions as he goes along, but the code is well crafted. Got into localStorage but didn't have time to implement (talked through how he would approach it if there was time, and it was a solid plan).

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Proficient:__ Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

#### Conditional Logic

* __Proficient:__ Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Exceptional:__ Comfortable with using callback functions where applicable. Comfortable returning collections from functions (objects, arrays).

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Exceptional:__ Can identify and apply best use cases for constructor functions vs object literals in their code, and leverages more advanced object prototype methods.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Proficient:__ Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* __Exceptional:__ Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of JavaScript syntax, style, and refactoring. Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DEBUGGING

#### Dev Tools/Debug Process

* __Proficient__: Uses the dev tools as their first line of defense when encountering something unexpected. Demonstrates comfort and skill using dev tools to investigate, check layout issues, console log results, and experiment solving problems before writing abundant amounts of code. Will experiment with javascript in the console to test unfamiliar concepts.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 2
## Evaluator: Bree
## Optional Notes:

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Exceptional:__ Can assess and implement data type decisions for implementation based on increasing performance, shoring up code to be concise/clean, and composing for future maintainability.

#### Conditional Logic

* __Proficient:__ Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Exceptional:__ Comfortable with using callback functions where applicable. Comfortable returning collections from functions (objects, arrays).

#### Arrays

* __Proficient:__ Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Proficient:__ Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the "why" of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## TESTING

#### Test Comprehension

* __Proficient__: Can read through each line of a test and understand how to drive the development to make the test pass. If stuck on making a test pass, they know how to investigate where and how the test is failing using the error messages.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DEBUGGING

#### Dev Tools/Debug Process

* __Proficient__: Uses the dev tools as their first line of defense when encountering something unexpected. Demonstrates comfort and skill using dev tools to investigate, check layout issues, console log results, and experiment solving problems before writing abundant amounts of code.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Exceptional:__ Developer skillfully captures the spirit and design intent of all comp details. Execution is pixel-perfect and any design decisions left open to interpretation are solved intentionally, are as seamless as if the designer had provided the solution, are handled gracefully, and enhance the overall design.

#### Design Concepts

* __Exceptional__: Typography, color choices, and layout decisions are thoughtful and appropriate, and strongly enhance the layout and legibility of the design.


## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### (Number Guesser)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/coleworsley/numberguesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This was our first project using vanilla javascript. We had to create a page that would generate a random number and count the number of guesses a user would take to find the correct one.

## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

Good attention to detail in matching the comp. Code needs some refactoring and clean up, but overall solid effort and good solution.

### Functional Expectations

* __Proficient:__ Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Conditional Logic

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is "truthy" and "falsey" in JavaScript.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticable and/or unintuative than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.


#### (Static Comp 1)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/coleworsley/static-comp-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This was our first static comp. We were tasked with recreating the image using only css and html.

#### (Static Comp 2)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/coleworsley/cw-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### (Photo Finder)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/coleworsley/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/foto-finder.html)

This was our first group project and it involved a bunch of new concepts actually being implemented for the first time. A user could select an image on their local drive and upload it to the page in a card format. The image, however, would not persist on page load.

## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

GREAT JOB. Did all sort of neat extras, had a modal so you can see a bigger version of the image. So many neat things!

Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner's learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

### Feedback:
Cole was an excellent partner to work with on the IdeaBox project. We were both on the same page the entire length of the project and did a great job switching roles back and forth between 'driver' and 'navigator'. Cole's schedule & commitment to the project were perfectly in-line with my own and we were able to get the entire project finished with time to spare and refactor a little bit. For the few features that we split between ourselves, Cole did a great job of explaining how his code worked and how it fit in to the overall code base. As much as I'm trying to think, I can't come up with anything that I would recommend Cole to change or improve upon in future pairings.

#### (2DoBox-Pivot)

### FeedBack from Christi:
Cole, I enjoyed working with you on 2DoBox. This week was a great learning experience for me. I really do appreciate you taking the time to go through our code and explain any concepts I was struggling with. You are getting this stuff unbelievably well and your willingness to help others in the cohort doesn't go unnoticed. Thank you!! Per our eval, we the only coaching feedback I have is that we both need to do a better job at not merging our own pull requests

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I believe I supported Turing by helping out wherever I could in the classroom. I took it slow when explaining things and in return I asked others to take it slow when explaining things to me.
