* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 4
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/coleworsley/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

For this project, we were tasked with recreating a prefix search trie.

###### Instructor: Limbo
###### Comments:
* Awesome job creating a simple UI with your published node module!
* Testing suite is robust, good work breaking it out

###### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3.85:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

###### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3.95: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

###### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

###### 4. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

###### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/coleworsley/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

In this project, we were tasked with recreating popular sorting algorithm in Javascript. These algorithms included:

* bubbleSort
* insertionSort
* mergeSort
* quickSort


###### Instructor: Limbo
###### Comments:
* make sure insertion is not bubblesort in a mask
* if you're gonna use es6, go all in
* testing: think about all the edge cases (e.g. empty array, array w/ length of 1, sad paths, etc.). Make tests BULLETPROOF


###### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### 2. Test-Driven Development

4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration. Arrays of random numbers and letters are generated to test the maximum number of elements which the algorithm can sort.

###### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility


###### 4. Functional Expectations

3.5: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

###### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

## C: Group Work & Projects

For Mod 2, we had two group projects. One was Weatherly where we worked with the weather underground API to build a basic weather app, and the other was Game Time, where we built a simple game using html canvas.

### Projects

#### Weatherly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NikBorn/Weatherly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

This was our first project using react and asynchronous js. We were tasked with using the weather underground api to build a react app that displays current weather and forecasts based on the location you determine.

###### Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

###### User Interface

3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

###### HTML Style

4 - Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

###### CSS/Sass Style

3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

###### JavaScript / React Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

###### Testing

3.8 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

###### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

###### Code Sanitation

4 - Zero complaints


#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/coleworsley/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

For this project, we used HTML canvas to build the game breakout.

###### Functional Expectations

* 3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

###### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

###### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

###### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

###### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Parable of the Polygon/Automation

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

I enjoyed the interactive website in this gearup. I thought it did a fantastic job demonstrating the tragedy of the commons. I thought we had some good discussions about how to make a beneficial change in our community.

#### Snowden GearUp

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/blackknight75/c7ef4e8ef1a197d50593bce078fc9d7f)

This was a gear up taught by mod4 students. I thought they did an excellent job provoking an interesting discussion. We were asked whether or not we would do the same thing in Snowden's position and we all shared our thoughts.

#### Empathy
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

This gear up was a great example of how it is important to be empathetic to others in the workplace. Since everyone comes from very different backgrounds, we must make sure to understand their story before making assumptions about their character. This is definitely something that needs to happen more in the workplace as well as everyday life.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod - I paired with some of the mod1 students to help them with their school work. Some of their feedback is as follows:

Shayla: Cole is a very helpful and logical pairing partner. I really enjoyed the opportunity he gave me to talk through why something would or wouldn't work. I learned how to think about a challenge differently, and how to think outside of what I would have normally chosen to do. Cole is also incredibly supportive, and allowed himself to be pulled in a few different directions at once. He's super bright, and one of my favorite people to tease. Thank you for being fantastic MerMan!

Ralph: I wanted to thank you for pairing up with me over the course of this mod, It was extremely helpful.  we worked on different things throughout the mod but the time you helped Molly and I on our linked list project was really helpful.  We were stuck on logic, you didn't hand us the answer rather gave us a different perspective which led us to our own answer.  For my own personal learning style it was very beneficial to get other peoples take on things and seeing their perspective on things, thanks again for helping me out this mod I really appreciate it!
