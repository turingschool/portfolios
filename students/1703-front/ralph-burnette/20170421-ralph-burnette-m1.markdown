## A: End of Module Assessment
# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 1

## Evaluator: Robbie

## Optional Notes:

* Struggled entirely through, but expected that. We got through getting the values from the input fields - paired all the way through this point, needed a lot of help.

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Novice:__ Can articulate the definitions of primitive data types: strings, booleans, numbers, null, and undefined. Can articulate and describe object types: objects, arrays.


#### Conditional Logic

* __Novice:__ Can understand when an expression evaluates to true or false.


#### Functions & Scope

* __Novice:__ Can write a simple function that takes at least one input argument.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Novice:__ Can declare an object literal and define/articulate properties vs. methods for an object. Can extract values of an object's property, and assign new properties and/or reassign values of existing properties on an object.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Novice:__ Can articulate what the DOM is and can effectively target elements in vanilla JavaScript via class, id, or tag.

#### Style

* __Novice:__ Can explain the choices made in the overall codebase and is able to articulate what every line of code is doing. Code is neatly formatted and easy to read with correct indentation.

# Pentathlon: Static Comp Challenge
## Evaluator: Bree
## Optional Notes:

* Great progress!
* Need to improve upon accessibility attributes in your html
* With the exception of some missing polish because you ran out of time, the comp is headed toward a very professional recreation of the comp provided
* HTML/CSS is definitely proficient. For next mod, keep working that muscle and reach exceptional. :)

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility
 
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags. 

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Proficient__ : Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS. 

#### Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

#### Design Concepts

* __Proficient__: Can apply fundamental design concepts in a comp that demonstrates a thoughtful, purposeful, cohesive strategy that does not detract from legibility or overall design integrity.




------------------------------------------------------------------

## DEBUGGING

#### Dev Tools/Debug Process

* __Novice__: Reaches for the dev tools "Elements" pane to experiment and test variations for their HTML/CSS. Uses the "Console" pane in conjunction with their coding to test outputs of their JS at appropriate times.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The following 

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://rburnette3.github.io/number_guesser/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This was the first project encountered using JavaScript.  The idea was to take an input value and compare against a pre-generated randomly selected number to see if it matched.  The user was given feed back of too high or low upon guess and would return a statement if guessed correctly.

## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags. 

#### Style

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

#### Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Advanced Beginner__ Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.

#### Conditional Logic

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is "truthy" and "falsey" in JavaScript.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.

#### Style

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint. 



#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://rburnette3.github.io/RB-static-comp-challenge-1/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

First static comp challenge.  We were provided a comp which needed to be recreated using the HTML and CSS fundamentals learned so far.

#### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://rburnette3.github.io/RB-static-comp-challenge-3/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

Final Static Comp Challenge.   We were provided a comp which needed to be recreated using the HTML and CSS fundamentals learned so far.  By far the most challenging and complex!!  Many moving parts and intricate details involving positioning.  Very difficult yet very rewarding at the same time.


## C: Group Work & Projects

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Week-1 Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

The First gear up session of our mod.  The message of this session still is very relevant at the end of the module.  I am constantly thinking on how I can improve, refusing to give up on myself and reverting back to a fixed mindset.  This Session has made me much more opptimistic about my personal growth and success.

#### week-2 Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

The Second gear up session.  I took away a good message to be good to myself when faced with challenge.  Understanding the power of positivity and embracing an healthy growth mindset will elad to success.  I need to reward myself for small victories and celebrate them everytime.  Even though the end goal may be far, looking back I will be able to see how far I have come.

#### Week-3 Working with Extro/Intro/Ambiverts

* [GitHub URL]()

This weeks session took a closer look into some personality characteristics of intro/ambi and extroverts.  I enjoyed this session because I felt as though it helped us all understand how different can be.  The major take away on this for me was a better understanding of communication with different types and also knowing how each would gain energy in day to day activiity.

#### Week-4 Story Telling and Strengths

Week four gear up session.  In this gear up we broke up into groups starting by telling stories of things or accomplishments f our past.  Also in gorups we broke apart to discuss strengths that we ave and how they may apply to the workforce.  Feedback on this was encouraging and also highlighted some things that others hear when you speak of yourself which you dont always see.

#### Week-5 Debugging the Gender Gap

Week five gear up.  We watched a film in regards to gender equality in the tech industry.  It was very disapointing to see such big name and successful companies still holding onto predisposed ways of thinking in this modern time.  It did however solidify the importance of my own actions and the impact one person can have.  We can make a difference and change the way we think.
