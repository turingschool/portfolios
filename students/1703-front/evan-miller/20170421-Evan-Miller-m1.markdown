-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 1

## Evaluator: Robbie

## Optional Notes:

* Quick to set everything up, added new inputs, fixed the CSS, and got the event listener going within five minutes
* Issues with calculating a tip percentage...
* Corrected the string concatenation bug pretty quickly (used parseInt)
* Got through the logic of disable button, and broke this out into it's own function

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Proficient:__ Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

#### Conditional Logic

* __Proficient:__ Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Proficient:__ Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Proficient:__ Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the "why" of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Proficient:__ Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DEBUGGING

#### Dev Tools/Debug Process

* __Proficient:__ Uses the dev tools as their first line of defense when encountering something unexpected. Demonstrates comfort and skill using dev tools to investigate, check layout issues, console log results, and experiment solving problems before writing abundant amounts of code. Will experiment with javascript in the console to test unfamiliar concepts.

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 2
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

- didn’t start off running the tests, jumped straight into writing code. I had to remind him to let the test guide him several times.
- Needs to work on letting the tests guide him (they can help you figure out weird things, let them!)
- didn’t automatically go to array prototypes, but knew what he wanted to do and when he explained it, it was what the array prototype would do. when i pointed him to the prototype methods, he was able to pick the right ones really quickly
- Good job!

#### Arrays

* __Proficient:__ Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## TESTING

#### Test Comprehension

* __Proficient__: Can read through each line of a test and understand how to drive the development to make the test pass. If stuck on making a test pass, they know how to investigate where and how the test is failing using the error messages.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DEBUGGING

#### Dev Tools/Debug Process

* __Proficient__: Uses the dev tools as their first line of defense when encountering something unexpected. Demonstrates comfort and skill using dev tools to investigate, check layout issues, console log results, and experiment solving problems before writing abundant amounts of code. Will experiment with javascript in the console to test unfamiliar concepts.

# Pentathlon: Static Comp Challenge
## Evaluator: Bree
## Optional Notes:

* Need to work on cross browser fixes and responsive breakpoints
* Need to improve on accessibility
* Your CSS looks heavy with over 1200 lines. Probably a lot of places to refactor and get that closer to 900

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Proficient:__ Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.  

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Proficient__ : Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

#### Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

#### Design Concepts

* __Proficient__: Can apply fundamental design concepts in a comp that demonstrates a thoughtful, purposeful, cohesive strategy that does not detract from legibility or overall design integrity.

##### Partner Feedboack: George
Evan you were an awesome partner!  I really enjoyed how well we were able to push and pull to Github throughout the entire development of the page.  Your recreation of the comp and responsiveness were perfect.  It was awesome that you were able to completely handle the CSS so that I had the time I needed to get the javascript to work, which kept taking me longer than we thought it would.  I think we could both improve on utilizing branches and going through the proper procedure of pushing the branch, creating the pull request, and approving the pull request.  We kept working in master, and even though it never caused any problems it’s not best practice. In the end I’m very happy with the project and you as my teammate. Would work with again, A++++++

##### Partner Feedboack: Jason

I really enjoyed working on this project with you.  You have a very positive attitude even under stressful circumstances.  Your original approach to solving some of the Jquery code was a great opportunity for me to learn some new things.  Thank you for taking the time to deconstruct your code with me and make sure that I understood how it worked.

##### Partner Feedboack: Hector
Hello Evan, I'd like to start off with thanking you for the incredible pairing experience that I had with you.  I was able to learn so much from working with you.  It was amazing to see your thought process in action when tackling a problem and I appreciate you taking the time to walk me through the different approaches you take in problem solving and encouraging me to do the same.  You are extremely resourceful.  I admire how you can search for answers online and apply them to the work at hand.  You seem to understand everything we work on very well and there is no doubt in my mind that you will go far here at Turing and in your future career as a software developer.  The only piece of advice that I could think to offer you is to work on Github.  It's something that I need more work on as well and if we had made small and consistent commits we would've had better feedback from Louisa during our evaluation in that aspect.  You have a brilliant mind Evan and I also want to take the time to thank you for your patience.  You took the time to explain the code line by line and made sure that I understood everything, thank you for that.  You were a great partner!  Keep up the good work!


## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/EvanSays/ac9522ded48c633078bffbcb094a6684)

Praise the process, not the just the outcome. Effort and difficulty  = new neurons and a strong mind. Give praise to my peers and help others build up their growth mindset.

#### Learning and Cognitive Resources

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/EvanSays/ac9522ded48c633078bffbcb094a6684)

Baby steps. Master the little things to achieve bigger things. Break things down into smaller chuncks. Get really good at one thing. So good at it that you dont have to think about it. Wont waste resources this way.


#### Working with introverts, extroverts, ambiverts

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/EvanSays/ac9522ded48c633078bffbcb094a6684)

We are all unique and range on the spectrum. I noticed that most of the class were in the middle. We gain energy from being alone and at times in groups.


#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/EvanSays/ac9522ded48c633078bffbcb094a6684)

Extremely helpful for me to now understand how to see the gap in teh workplace. We must be inclusive in our workplace and know that everyone is on the same level in regard to learning ability.

## E: Community Participation
