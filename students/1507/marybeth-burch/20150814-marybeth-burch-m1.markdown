## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I started this module with little experience, outside of Pragmatic Studios (I took my time completing the whole thing, and found myself referencing it often) and some CodeAcademy and Treehouse work. It is amazing to me how I can feel like I've learned so much in six weeks, but still feel like I am just getting started. This module, I feel that one of my strengths was persevering through challenges and not seeking help too soon. I feel like I found a good balance of contributing and learning from others in the team projects of which I was a part. Next module, one of my goals is to work more with mentors. I think this would have helped me move forward faster on some of my individual projects this module. It was challenging to strike a balance between too much and too little support.

### End of Module Assessment

I was first assessed by Mike Dao, and did not pass the assessment. I was too nervous during the test to remember what I knew, and I kept mixing up FileIO and CSV's. After spending a little too much time feeling bad about how I did, myself and a few others who had to re-assess took some time to study together and share our ideas. I reassessed with Josh Cheek and felt much more confident. Below are my scores and feedback from Josh for my Scrabble challenge on highest scoring word:

"Nice initial anticipation of enumerable methods, and good extrapolation of 'max_by' to handle the rest of the problem."

"Good job explaining what you're thinking, and good analysis of the problem."

* Ruby Syntax and API: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Blocks & Enumerations: 4
* Testing: 3
* Workflow: 3+
* Collaboration: 4

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of an absence on Friday, August 14th for a family commitment scheduled prior to my acceptance at Turing.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

In this project, I created a parser to convert markdown into HTML. This project was my first exposure to using markdown. It was also my first experience using File IO, and I feel like it gave me a solid base for the rest of our Module 1 projects. My project was evaluated by Jeff with the following results:

"Good small components"
"Good happy-path tests, need to define the edges a bit more"
"Like that you iterated on the implementation"
"Overall good progress!"

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Functionality: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Linked Lists

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/linked-lists)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown)

In this project, I wrote an implementation of a linked list that could perform a variety of functions such as appending, prepending, and searching by index and value.

"Good tests and some attention to the edge cases"
"Implementation looks solid"
"Some good reuse of functionality"

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping / Recursion: 3

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/EnigmaPlus)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

My partner and I worked together to create a program that would encrypt and decrypt messages based on different rotations determined by generated keys and offsets. For the most part, we collaborated well. Sometimes I felt it was hard for me to get my ideas heard. This helped me go into my next project with some goals around sharing air time and making sure I was being a respectful listener. We received the following feedback and scores on Enigma:

"some successes, some struggles -- encrypt and decrypt work pretty well, and would both like to spend more time refactoring, share functionality, reduce
duplication"
"struggled through File I/O but eventually got it figured out"
"implementation has lots of good parts but some gaps in clarity, maybe helped
with a little rethinking of variable/method names and how the words become paragraphs"

* Functionality: 2
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

My partner said: "The highlight of pairing with MB was seeing each of our ideas succeed at different points in the project. Many times it felt this project would have gone faster if it was a solo assignment but I was reminded of the benefits of pair programming during those times when her ideas worked and mine would've held us back. I feel we both learned a lot about effective communication during pairing, especially during a stressful project. I would enjoy working with MB again at some point in the future and I hope she feels the same!"


#### Sales Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/sales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sales_engine.markdown)

My partner and I created a data reporting tool and built numerous relationships between different data files. I'd been feeling less than confident all module with using methods across different classes and pulling data in from files. I feel like I learned so much from this project, including our late night last minute learning on storing data in hashes so we're not running too many loops, and making sure to commit to GitHub way more often than we did. We received the following feedback and scores on Sales Engine:

"Strong test isolation."
"Great use of enumerables, with minimal nested blocks."

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation/ Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 4
* Code Sanitation: 4

My partner said:
Positives:
MB was a really great collaborator to work with on sales engine. She does an amazing job of walking through problems and algorithms deliberately. This causes her to be very deliberate with her thinking, and makes the conclusions she comes to almost exclusively correct and on point.
In pairing, she is very receptive to feedback and generally hearing her partner's suggestions and opinions. She also is very conscious and empathetic towards the feelings of her partner and goes out of her way to make sure that the relationship between her and her partner is positive and productive.
MB is also a an extremely hard worker. It was awesome to not have to think about whether she would want to put in the hours to make our project work.

Areas For Growth:
MB can sometimes not voice her opinions or ideas, or not defend her ideas (which are typically really great and on point) when she receives push back on them. For me personally, I typically want to hear logical reasoning behind whatever position my partner is putting forth in order to buy into the idea. Sometimes when I would ask clarifying questions of MB she wouldn't defend her own idea and we wouldn't end up using it. Once, this caused us to walk down the wrong road with my idea for a given solution, only to have her idea be the right one after a few hours when we tried to implement it.
Another area for growth might be trying to maintain positivity and emotional constancy when faced with challenges during the process of a project. For our specific experience, I think  a lot of this was clearly attributed to extenuating circumstances, but sometimes I had to practice a lot of calmness and positivity when MB was feeling upset with the circumstances of our project. Again, this was definitely caused by a specific situation that I don't think will be a problem moving forward, but it might be something to look out for in the future.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I'm looking forward to getting a feedback app set up in the near future. I think I was able to provide my partners on bigger projects with meaningful feedback that was both positive and useful. In Enigma, my partner and I were having issues hearing each others' ideas and I was able to address this and help us figure out more effective communication. I'm not one to shy away from giving and receiving honest feedback, and I'd like to help our cohort think about how we can make this happen in an authentic way for each other. I found it hard to remember to take the time for feedback with someone who I may have just been working with for an hour or so, and I think having an organized fashion in which to do this will be helpful.

My peers said:
* "MB is extremely dedicated which is an inspiration. She is also pleasant to work with, proceeding in a steady manner. She doesn't hesitate to ask questions, using the resources the team has to offer."

* "I didn’t get the opportunity to pair with you so I can’t give you technical feedback.  But it meant a lot to mean when I was feeling emotional about my enigma project and my partner and you listened to me and were supportive."

### Playing a Part

* I joined the outreach Slack channel, but haven't felt confident enough in my skills to step up yet. I look forward to doing outreach in Module 2, and have spoken with some teacher friends about the possibility of working with their middle school students.

* On Linked Lists and Enigma, I spent time working with a cohort member who was having difficulty understanding parts of the project. I also put my work aside when she was upset and needed someone to talk to.

* I am enjoying my time on student advisory board each Thursday, although I would like to find a better way to solicit more feedback from my cohort so I have more to share.

* I reminded my posse when it was our cleanup week and I also have pitched in a few mornings and evenings to put away dishes or load the dishwasher.

* Attended meetups including Women Who Code study groups and Turing Community Night for front-end development.

* I am present for posse time each morning and collaborate on warm-ups.
