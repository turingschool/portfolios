# Travis Haby - M1 - Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

During this module I set out to gain a foothold in the world of programming,
and take in as much information and as many skills as I could over these
6 weeks. Fundamentals of coding in object-oriented ruby and learning workflow
tools like git, github and waffle were the things I focused on the most.

### Attendance

I missed the first Friday of week one intentionally because I had to attend
a good friend's wedding in Maine. I unintentionally had to miss the following
Monday as well due to travel delays caused by storms at the airport I was
connecting through. I also missed one hour on Friday, August 7th, because I
had to leave early for the airport to attend another friend's pre-wedding
activities as a groomsman. People need to seriously chill out with all this
marriage business.

### Work

I completed the following work this module:

#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/travishaby/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/chisel.html)

This was our first project. We created a parser that took markdown and
translated it into HTML.

##### Notes

* Program Works
* No extensions
* Some refactoring for clearity
* needs File IO class
* things in fileio.rb should be in chisel.rb

##### Scores

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Functionality: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/travishaby/linkedlist.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown)

This was our second project where we built the functionality of an array
by creating a linked list of nodes.

##### Notes

* Saw some logic broken out into separate methods.
* Could use some better naming.
* Had recursive and iterative

##### Scores

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3.5
* Looping / Recursion: 4

## Team

### Projects

These are the projects I completed with other students as a team.

#### Engima

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/travishaby/enigma.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

This project created Alan Turing's famous enigma machine but in code.

##### Notes

* started with a pretty tangled web, restarted, realized there'd be some dependencies
and tangles
* Had encrypt and decrypt done by Sunday, but then reworked
* Good tests overall, leave some areas to be filled in at the edges
* Implementation is pretty good with a few fragments that are "above your level" -- a little SO help
* Some crafty bits pulled from intro tutorials, but good paying attention
* Need the output messages when we run encrypt/decrypt/crack, but functionality
is fine

##### Scores

* Functionality: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

###### From Tyler Komoroske
Positives: Travis was an awesome partner to have for Enigma. He was very flexible when it came to meeting up to get some work done, and showed dedication and determination to produce great work. He was an excellent teacher throughout the coding process. I typically struggle with code implementation and Travis always took the time to make sure I understood the code before moving on to the next task. Very effective communicator as well.

Areas for growth: Travis generally handled most of the code implementation, which was definitely partly because he was much better at implementing code than I was. But I do wish that I had more of a chance to actually write our code base. I chose not to speak up due to time constraints and I wanted to make sure we had a working product. Maybe in the future it might be a good idea for Travis to let others do more of the driving.


#### Sales Engine

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/travishaby/sales_engine.git
* [Original Assignment] http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/sales_engine.html

##### Notes & Scores

9:00 - Mary Beth Burch, Travis Haby

1. Functional Expectations
* Base expectations met
3: Application fulfills all base expectations as tested by the spec harness

2. Test-Driven Development
* Strong test isolation. Lacking multiple assertions and maximum
  robustification, but most tests were very strong.
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation
and integration using appropriate data

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* Lacked the use of modules, but showed good signs of first pass at refactoring
duplications
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the
principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* Nothing remarkable, but Ruby fundamentals are well demonstrated.
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and
refactoring

5. Enumerable & Collections
* Great use of enumerables, with minimal nested blocks.
4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

6. Code Sanitation
4: Zero complaints

###### From MaryBeth Burch

+  I enjoyed working with you even through late nights and hours long stumbling blocks because I felt like rarely did we get too frustrated with each other. You were always focused and ready to work, but also maintain an easy going and relaxed energy which I think helped us to get through this while still enjoying most of the process. Every once in awhile I noticed it seemed like we were both trying to share our ideas at the same time and had something we wanted to try. I felt like this was easy to overcome though. I wonder how we could have, or can in future partnerships, figure out the best way to commit to trying one idea at a time.

+ You more than pulled your weight on this project, and were always willing to put in the time needed and think about the project both together and at home. Thanks for working to figure out GitHub with me. I think we ended up using it pretty effectively, which will so help me in future projects. I feel much more confident with it now, and with partner workflow in general. Waffle on!

+ You stayed positive even through our last ridiculous final push, and were able to keep reminding yourself that even though we weren’t where we wanted to be, our long term learnings from that will be so valuable. This is such an important mindset to maintain throughout this program.

+ I felt like you struck a great balance of listening to my ideas and letting me experiment, while still pushing me to explain my thinking. You asked great questions about the decisions I had in mind, which helped me to better understand my process, and why we were choosing to do things the way we did. Only on a few occasions did I feel like you were taking on too much of the driving and navigating as you figured things out, and I didn’t have a chance to try out some of my own ideas. Whenever I brought it up, you were great about returning to sharing more of the responsibility. I think we could both benefit from trying more traditional driver navigator patterns on occasion, with the dual purpose of forcing us to explain ourselves clearly rather than brainstorming and typing, and I also think it would have helped me to more clearly understand some of your decisions.


## Community

### Giving Feedback

I gave constructive feedback to any people in the Turing community that I had interactions with during the module. I tried to make sure that this feedback was specific and frank, as I feel that we only grow when our weaknesses are directly confronted, and we only cement our best attributes when our strengths are clearly defined.

### Receiving Feedback

###### What is something Travis has done that was beneficial this module?

* Travis volunteered to be the driver for almost every warmup challenge, and approached both warmups and exercisms with enthusiasm and a genuine desire to learn. This, in turn, infected the rest of the posse, and had a positive effect on all members.

* Asking for people to use "I" statements in retro. This leads to a huge shift in group interaction, creates a safer environment, and because of that, directly impacted Turing's mission. Thank you.

* Travis's positive attitude is a big help. I think a lot of ppl underestimate how important the mood of the people around you can be. Having positive people around helps you to keep calm and be positive. Emotions are contagious.
worked diligently at warmup exercises

###### What is something Travis did this module he could work on improving for the future?

* I honestly didn't see anything I can point to that I think is a "thing" he should work on.

* Taking time with basic ruby exercises and seeking to understand his tools better. Travis enjoys jumping in, which is an asset mostly, but can lead to getting halfway through the sandwich before asking what's in it.

###### Is there anything else you'd like Travis to know?

* Travis is a true pleasure to work with, and bring positive energy and confidence to the table at every sitting.

* Glad to have part of our class pal!

### Playing a Part

As a new Turing community member, it was definitely hard to give back to the community when I felt like I always had so many needs that required taking so much.

I try to channel my past life as a teacher whenever possible to both have patience with other people who are explaining things to me, and trying to share the slight amounts of knowledge that I've accumulated thus far with others who need help.

I did also try to help out with small things I knew I could contribute, like making more pots of coffee than I can count, and cleaning out the entire large workroom refrigerator when it smelled disgusting. I also helped clean up after field day--come to think of it I might be the maid of Turing.
