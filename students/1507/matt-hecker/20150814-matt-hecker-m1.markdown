### Areas of Emphasis

one of my goals was, and is, to work on my soft skills. To be able to listen, speak, learn and educate effectively and with empathy.

Going into the program. I felt I had an academic headstart, This turned out to be completely false but that thought informed my goals going into the program.

1. Ruby Syntax & API

Score: 3

* No issues

4: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions using the best-choice tools Ruby has to offer
3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby
2: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental concepts
1: Developer spends significant time debugging elementary syntax or concepts


2. Ruby Style

Score: 3

* Typically, people put newlines between method definitions
* Indentation and such were fine

4: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity
3: Developer writes code that is easy to follow
2: Developer writes code that has unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity
1: Developer writes code that is difficult to understand


3. Blocks & Enumerations

Didn't get the chance to look at these

4: Developer is able to consistently select and implement the best-choice enumerator methods with blocks
3: Developer demonstrates understanding of blocks and can effectively use enumerable methods
2: Developer can use enumerator methods, but struggles to choose the right one for the job or demonstrates weak understanding of blocks
1: Developer is not able to use enumerator methods or blocks to solve the problem at hand


4. Testing

* More tests than necessary initially (several can be combined)
* Good reading through the problem again and making sure that the tests cover the behaviour you see

4: Developer consistently takes small steps, using the tests for both design and verification
3: Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks
2: Developer uses tests to guide development, but does not break features down into small problems
1: Developer does not integrate testing throughout their development process


5. Workflow

Score: 3

* Using fish!
* Customizing shell
* Speed your keys up

4: Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development
3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts
2: Developer smoothly moves between tools, but is dependent entirely on mouse-driven interaction
1: Developer gets work done, but wastes significant time or screen real estate


6. Collaboration

Score: 3-

* Didn't seem to understand what I was advocating with taking the example from the challenge and turning it into a test.

4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck
3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process
2: Developer asks detailed questions when progress slows or stops
1: Developer is able to integrate unsolicited feedback but does not really collaborate

## Community

### Getting Feedback

I've asked for feedback via google forms and the little feedback i got was very generic.

I asked other members of my cohort personally and I couldn't really write fast enough to quote.

Here are some key points I've heard that I need to work on.
##### Negative
* I move too fast, whether or not I am in the position of teaching something or pairing or just having a conversation I tend to move from subject to subject or context to context without the other person feeling like they have a say in the matter

* I interrupt people, on my side of things I'm getting really excited about a concept and in my own eagerness to offer what I think is helpful or relevant I sort of just blurt things out. On the other person's side of the story they are just in the middle of speaking and I sort of talk over them. I really need to work on this

##### Positive

* I move fast, both a positive and a negative. I can help people faster if I can pick up on their code faster.

* I am flexible, I can work around logistics such as scheduling problems and the like.

### Giving Feedback

I enjoyed and am enjoying the program so far. I feel like I am learning at a very rapid rate. Furthermore I feel like I am being pushed to learn the right things. As a sort of meta feedback I also like how responsive to feedback the instructors have been.

### Playing a Part

I haven't done that much to support the larger community but I never felt like I was in a position to. most support I have given has been to my cohort, they work really hard. I talk with students from other cohorts but I am at a loss of what I can do to help them.
