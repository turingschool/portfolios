#### Chad Minnerath - Module 1 Portfolio

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of the full day on July 9th, and a half day on

### End of Module Assessment
Assessed By: Mike

Notes:

* Created class before test.
* Had to be reminded to test first.
* Had to be reminded to look at the error messages before trying to fix bugs.
* Had a lot of difficulty working with the CSV library, looking at documentation did not help.
* Enumerable syntax was shaky, but self-corrected with error messages.

Scores:

* Ruby Syntax & API: 2
* Ruby Style: 3
* Blocks & Enumerations: 3
* Testing: 3
* Workflow: 4
* Collaboration: 4

### Work

## Sales Engine

1. Functional Expectations
Too much of the Business Intelligence not completed. What was completed was well
done.
2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes

2. Test-Driven Development
Tests checked out, but with too little robustification. Isolation and the use of
fixture data was very good.
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration
tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
Could have utilized modules and better refactoring for duplication, but for the
most part methods were concise. The group realized the patterns which needed
work, but did not have enough time.
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the
principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
Both members show great promise to become skilled Rubists. With more time and
organization this was on track to become a great Sales Engine.
4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and
refactoring

5. Enumerable & Collections
Nested enumerables were a little too rampant, but the enumerables were clean and
well understood/explained.
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

6. Code Sanitation
Not enough time to refactor, most of the complaints could be solved with simple
changes
2: Six to ten complaints

## Enigma

# Scores

1. Functionality:
Score: 3
Encrypts / decrypts / cracks

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style:
Score: 3
Don't do the work in initialize

3. Test-Driven Development:
Score: 3
Can't run all tests
Have to edit the code to run tests
Tests have good names

4. Breaking Logic into Components:
Score: 2
Move difficult bits up the stack (ARGV, file reading / writing, printing)

### Individual Work

## Linked Lists

Notes

16 tests all pass
Got through all functionality
Good effort on testing, include edge cases for the more difficult parts
Consistent iteration use
Some parts are a bit difficult to mentally parse

# Scores

1. Functional Expectations: 3

2. Test-Driven Development: 3

3. Encapsulation: 2

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

5. Looping / Recursion: 3

## Chisel

GitHub URL: https://github.com/cminnerath/chisel

#Notes
Program working.
There is no chisel class.
Chisel.rb main is a "god" object
some reptition in code especially in header parsing
significant refactoring needed
tests non functional or non existant

#Scores

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2

2. Test-Driven Development: 1

3. Functionality: 3

4. Breaking Logic into Components: 2
