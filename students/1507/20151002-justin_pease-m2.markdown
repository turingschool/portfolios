### Areas of Emphasis

  This module was tough.  I think the classes were great and the way the lessons and projects were setup were well structured.  Each lesson built up to the next.  I find myself struggling to keep up with this much knowledge coming in this fast but it was fun learning how rails works and how to put together begging web apps.  
  Thanks for spending the last 6 weeks teaching us Josh!

### Giving Feedback

David Shim
I'd love to give David Shim a big thank you.  He spent a number of hours with me helping me learn rails.  I do very well with one on one instruction and I am grateful David was able and willing to spare some of his time to help me.  He was really good at leading me to solve the problems myself and learn the material instead of just telling me the answers.  Thanks David!

Alon Waisman
Alon is a great guy.  I think he is often misunderstood.  He is always looking to help other people who are struggling.  He constantly brings in snacks to share with people which shows he is actively looking to give others.  He is a very strong problem solver and was fun working with on our last project.  I was struggling to keep up but he constantly came to me and walked me through the learning.  Thanks for that!

Matt Hecker
I haven’t been able to spend much time with Matt until this project.  I was blown away with his vast knowledge and problem solving skills but also with his leadership.  He was organized, structured and on top of this project from start to finish.  He has a gentle way of leading which is very easy to follow but not to suggest he is weak in any way.  he is a great programmer, leader and a great guy to know.  It was a real pleasure being on his team.

Regis Boudinot
I really like Regis.  He is a fun guy to hang out with and is like by everyone.  He is a very good programmer but being easy to be around is so valuable when working long hours.  It made the project lighter woking with him and this project was long and stressful for me so I am glad he was there.  

### Feedback Received

Jhun de Andres
There aren’t enough words for me to express how thankful I am for Justin. I remember him introducing himself to me during my first week of my module and He was immediately starting to reassure me that my fears weren't valid. I knew pretty immediately that he was going to be not only an amazing classmate to me but a great friend. The first project I felt I did pretty well on was Linkedlist and Justin is one of the main reasons as to why I understood that project. He would stay after class to help me and if you know me I can be pretty dense at times. When I failed my first module assessment He reassured me that I would do great the next time around. Justin is one of the many reasons why Turing is what it is. This place wouldn’t not be the same without him.

Regis Boudinot
Justin - Justin has improved a lot since his repeat of module 1. He seems to be absorbing the material at a healthier rate. Justin is a great person to be around and I look forward to keep working with him in the future. Justin actively seeks mentorship and asks a lot of questions but I think that he could benefit from trying to take a step back and learn more on his own. If he could spend a bit more time looking at the docs and re-reading them I think he would improve his absorption rate. His patience is a virtue and it is contagious in a good way.

### Playing a Part

Again, I was overloaded this module.  I think I actually spent a lot more hours this module working.  I try and do what I can to be positive and encouraging with the people around me.   I was glad that I had time and was able to help Jhun with his linked-list project and it was also a way to pay back the people who helped me.  I am still waiting to open a discussion with the school on how I might be able to participate in the soft skill development of student; an area I am passionate about.
