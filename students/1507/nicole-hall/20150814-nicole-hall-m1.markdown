Nicole Hall-M1-Portfolio 8/14/2015

Individual Assessment: Yes
Required Project: SalesEngine
Included Projects: Enigma, (Linked List & Chisel for Foxtrot)
Feedback: Self-Solicited

### Individual
I had a loss in the family/personal set-back but came back to Turing even though I would have preferred to stay in bed forever.  I forced myself to be resilient and determined. These are character traits that will be valuable as I continue my education at Turing and in the work place

###Areas of Emphasis
During Module One, my goals were:
-learn Ruby
    Objects
    Methods
    Classes
    OOP
    TDD

-learn the fundamental tools of software development
    Mac OS
    Git
    GitHub
    Text Editors
    Command Line

##Personal Development:
Working through Little Schemer on recommendation from Katrina Owen to help with understanding of recursion

I wake up early and re-read through my class notes.

Three pairing sessions with posse mentors weekly.  Robert Gu, Chris Moeller, Geoffrey Schorkopf and Will Mitchell.  If they weren’t available, I’d pair with anyone at turing who was willing (Mainly Matt Ewell, DJ, Mike Dao and Rolen Le)

Attended DJ’s after-school session about git/git hub work flow and Atom and bash profile customization.


##End of Module Assessment
## Notes

* Very calm, measured approach to solving the problem
* Needed a little reminder to write/use the tests
* Some bit of overthinking. Related to some challenges about understanding abstraction.

## Scores

### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 2: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental concepts

### 2. Ruby Style

* 2: Developer writes code that has unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity

### 3. Blocks & Enumerations

* 3: Developer demonstrates understanding of blocks and can effectively use enumerable methods

### 4. Testing

* 3: Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks

### 5. Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### 6. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking *before* attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

##Work
(Chisel)
GitHub URL https://github.com/NicoleHall/Chisel

Notes
Some tests and implementation, but doesn't run/pass
Went into some "puts driven development"
Ended up with some good parts but overall the project isn't where it needs to be

Scores
Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2
Test-Driven Development: 1
Functionality: 1
Breaking Logic into Components: 2

Group Project

Evaluation comments:
When testing is difficult

Identify that it is painful
What is making it difficult, eg our

Notes
The painful things
 reading / writing / printing / global vars (ARGV)
The solution
 Push the painful things up the callstack
 (the method that called it has to deal with it)
Remove the painful thing by pushing it up the callstack. Thus, the calling environment has to deal with it.

Scores
Functionality:
Score 3
Does encrypting, decrypting, cracking in under 1 second
Does not print the correct key
Fundamental Ruby & Style:
Score 3
Watch whitespace
Test-Driven Development:
Score 2
Tests don't pass
Breaking Logic into Components:

Score 3

Indivdual Project
LinkedList
https://github.com/NicoleHall/Linked_List

Notes
23 tests, all pass
All methods work
Tried for 2-3 tests per feature
Tests are clear and make sense
Implementation is solid but using Enumerable is a bit of a reach

Scores
Functional Expectations: 3
Test-Driven Development: 3
Encapsulation: 2
Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
Looping / Recursion: 3


##feedback to me:
“Nicole helped me sort out my most_revenue method for sales engine! who knew you could put end.sort?! Thanks!" - Mimi Schatz

"Here’s why you’re awesome, and you should put this in your portfolio.  You have tons of tenacity and courage! I’ve heard you talk about struggling with some of what we’re learning, but you continue to dig deep and work towards understanding. You ask important questions that help the rest of your cohort, and you are constantly advocating for yourself by seeking support from those in other modules and from mentors. I think, as you move forward, this is obviously going to help you, but I think it will make you such a resource to new students."  -MB Burch


### Giving Feedback
Feedback to Adam Jenson--partner for Enigma:

"Popsicle:
You were great at taking the various stages of the Enigma problem and working through each.  The problem included encrypt, decrypt, crack, and of course writing the code that would print the transformed strings to .txt files.

You took initiative and wrote some of the classes and methods on your own.

You were then willing to put your work aside and pair with me to re-write the key generator and key offset classes.

You were very helpful in teaching me about initialize.  I particularly liked your analogy that baby giraffes are born with long necks.  I still think about the analogy when writing initialize methods.  I think "What will the objects of this class be born with?".  That helps me decide what goes in initialize.

Poop-sicle:
There was a point where you panicked and got frustrated.  Although I fully admit that I was slowing you down and my ruby skills were less concrete than yours, the unwritten assignment of Enigma was to learn how to work effectively as a pair.  

The actionable feedback is:
-make sure to talk to your pair if you are feeling anxious.  The communication between pairing partners is what will make the program and process good.  
-we weren't very good about taking pomodoro brakes.  Maybe more breaks would have alleviated some of the stress.

Back to Popsicle:
Once we talked about the problem & identified the conflict, we were able to move on.  There were no hard feelings.  Which is so important.  Jeff made a little speech on Friday about the relationships between Turing students being as important as the ability to program.  You are the exact type of student who will continue to build the Turing reputation and your behavior exemplifies the point Jeff was trying to make.

Good luck on your assessment and sales engine and portfolio,
Nicole Hall"

### Playing a Part
Brought in breakfast burritos and overcame an initial shyness by sitting by the burritos and accepting thanks from hungry students.  Introduced myself to students.

Participated in field day.

Set up lunch review with Josh Cheek for OkCuGit.  Myself and three other students attended

Attended Women Who Code Meet-Up on 7/22 at Turing.  I met a lady named Betina who just moved from NYC.  She’s a web designer and she’s looking to learn more coding.  I encouraged her to come to turing. But she said she’s still paying off undergrad loans.

Joan Clarke Society on 7/16.  I met Chandra and she told me all about the interview process and how she and her cohort-mate Tino both got hired.  She said the company only intended to hire one student but they were so impressed with the Turing students, they hired two.  That made me feel really good about my choice to attend turing
Review

Joan Clarke Society on 7/28.  I talked with Miriam about her new job.  I talked with Jamie Kawahara in mod 4 about her ramp-up and how she did pragmatic over and over again.

7/30 got waffles with Kristina, Tom Lavin and brought waffles back for Adam Jenson, who stayed up very late working on enigma.
