#Adam Jensen - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

I started Turing with self-practice and study focused on Javascript. This mostly consisted of online tutorials and begging approachable devs to teach me. I am happy to say that I have finally stepped outside of browser IDEs and am now working in Ruby. I started with *zero* Ruby skills knowledge on July 6, 2015. I have since completed the following projects and fully understand all work that was submitted. A main goal of mine was to make sure that I only included code that I was able to understand. I was able to use self-management skills to make the most of the past 6 weeks 'keep up' with the curriculum.

### Areas of Emphasis

My primary goal entering M1 was to learn Ruby and TDD. In the last 6 weeks, I feel like I have adequately learned the following Ruby fundamentals:

* Strings and Integers
* Arrays
* Hashes
* Enumerables
* Object-Oriented-Design basics
* Call Stacks, Scopes, execution control
* the Ruby Object Model

I also worked on soft skills such as:

* Pairing
* Communication
* Approaching problems with systematic logic

### End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

### Attendance

I did not miss any time during Module 1. There were no tardy or absent occurrences.

### Work

I completed the following projects this module:

### Projects

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adamki/linked-lists)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/data_structures_and_algorithms/tree/master/linked_lists)

Still, in my opinion, the hardest project of my Turing experience so far. However, quickyl realized that also the most important lesson to learn so far.

* Struggled early, but later parts made more sense without help
* Good tests needs some edge case work
* Good functionality
* Some spots for better refactoring/encapsulation

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping / Recursion: 3

#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adamki/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

In this project I built a Markdown Parser. This was great fun and I thought it was a good learning lesson.

* Program runs.
* No extensions
* Chisel class has no methods, just code.
* Some mixing of logic.
* HTML output has extraneous brackets and new lines.


* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Functionality: 2.5
* Breaking Logic into Components:3

## Team

####  Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NicoleHall/Enigma-Project)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Good project. Loved using Enigma as a springboard to learning how classes/objects connect. I also learned that pairing is hard.

Does encrypting, decrypting, cracking in under 1 second
Does not print the correct key
Watch whitespace
Tests don't pass

* Functionality:3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 2
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Final Assessement

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:

* Good command of editor and terminal.
* Wrote tests first.
* Has a good instinct on starting small with tests and on what to test.
* Ran tests at very small intervals, to check progress
* Reached for #select, to filter words.
* Good communication skills, with laying out train of thought.

Scores:

* Ruby Syntax & API: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Blocks & Enumerations: 3
* Testing: 4
* Workflow: 4
* Collaboration: 4

####SalesEngine

Assessed By DJ

Adam Jensen, Chad Minnerath

1. Functional Expectations
Too much of the Business Intelligence not completed. What was completed was well
done.
2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes

2. Test-Driven Development
Tests checked out, but with too little robustification. Isolation and the use of
fixture data was very good.
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration
tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
Could have utilized modules and better refactoring for duplication, but for the
most part methods were concise. The group realized the patterns which needed
work, but did not have enough time.
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the
principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
Both members show great promise to become skilled Rubists. With more time and
organization this was on track to become a great Sales Engine.
4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and
refactoring

5. Enumerable & Collections
Nested enumerables were a little too rampant, but the enumerables were clean and
well understood/explained.
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

6. Code Sanitation
Not enough time to refactor, most of the complaints could be solved with simple
changes
2: Six to ten complaints

### Giving Feedback

#### #From Nicole Hall:

Popsicle:
You were great at taking the various stages of the Enigma problem and working through each.  The problem included encrypt, decrypt, crack, and of course writing the code that would print the transformed strings to .txt files.

You took initiative and wrote some of the classes and methods on your own.

You were then willing to put your work aside and pair with me to re-write the key generator and key offset classes.

You were very helpful in teaching me about initialize.  I particularly liked your analogy that baby giraffes are born with long necks.  I still think about the analogy when writing initialize methods.  I think "What will the objects of this class be born with?".  That helps me decide what goes in initialize.

Poop-sicle:
There was a point where you panicked and got frustrated.  Although I full admit that I was slowing you down and my ruby skills were less concrete than yours, the unwritten assignment of Enigma was to learn how to work effectively as a pair.  

The actionable feedback is:
-make sure to talk to your pair if you are feeling anxious.  The communication between pairing partners is what will make the program and process good.  
-we weren't very good about taking pomodoro brakes.  Maybe more breaks would have alleviated some of the stress.

Back to Popsicle:
Once we talked about the problem & identified the conflict, we were able to move on.  There were no hard feelings.  Which is so important.  Jeff made a little speech on Friday about the relationships between Turing students being as important as the ability to program.  You are the exact type of student who will continue to build the Turing reputation and your behavior exemplifies the point Jeff was trying to make.


#####From George Hudson

I think each time you approached me with a question, you were attentive and enthusiastic. You let me know if I was able to help you with positive feedback which was encouraging for  me. I wish I could provide something more constructive, but our interactions were fairly limited, so I donâ€™t have anything coming to mind that you could improve upon.


### Playing a Part

I try and help out as much as possible with other students and feel that I am becoming a better person for Student Advisory Board. I have not made any huge contributions to the Turing Community.
