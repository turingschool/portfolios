# Regis Boudinot - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I felt weak on ruby. I had self taught myself the basic
syntax but felt very weak on enumerables, working with hashes, and manipulating
arrays. I had never even made a class or a method before. I feel as if I have
learned more than I could even imagine learning so far. I am really pleased
with my progress so far. Ruby is now more of a playground than a minefield.

Initially I also struggled with understanding the concept behind TDD
but now I am driving my code with tests and refactoring methods as I go.

### End of Module Assessment

* Ruby Syntax & API: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Blocks & Enumerations: 3
* Testing: 3
* Workflow: 3
* Collaboration: 3

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time. I came in an hour early
most of the time to get ready for the day.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/selfup/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

This project was a markdown to HTML converter. I was evaluated by Jeff with
the following results:

"Like that it works!"

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 2
* Functionality: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/selfup/linked_list)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown)

In this project I implemented a linked list using both recursion and iteration.
It was evaluated by Mike with the following results:

"Tail method had an iterative and recursive version.
Good that the count method is SRP."

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping / Recursion: 3.5

## Team

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/selfup/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

In this project we created an encryption/decryption/cracking machine.
It was evaluated by Josh Cheek with the following results:

"Use the interface before it exists, so that you can discover what it should be.
This will lead to elegance."

* Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3-
* Breaking Logic into Components: 2

#### Sales Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/selfup/sales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sales_engine.markdown)

In this project we built a system of several interacting Ruby objects using TDD.

"Well tested with creative assertions for edge cases."

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic in Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3
* Code Sanitation: 4

### Feedback to Me

I was told:

"I think you could benefit from planning code out before implementing it.
When pairing, it can be confusing to follow your train of thought before you
have planned it out"

"But overall, I think you are a great person to have in the community.
You’re outgoing, easy to approach, etc."

"Regis has been a great addition to Turing.  He has always been willing and able
to help me with most things. If I had any negative feedback for him it’s that he
needs to be more confident in himself. He got stressed out in the beginning but
mostly because he didn’t think he was capable enough which he is. Remember that
emotions can be contagious."

I need to slow down and communicate more. Ever since said
feedback I have now discovered that writing test first enables me to slow down
and more appropriately describe what I am doing. Testing also helps me build
confidence.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I gave feedback to a number of my classmates and they were happy that my
feedback was actionable and supportive.

Here are some examples:

"I think that you could work on using methods that handle more of the work
instead of writing large methods. Communicate a bit more while pairing.
Otherwise I think that you are very good at understanding how to solve the
problem at hand."

"Justin is a great member of the community. He goes out of his way to ensure
that the community around him is being built and seems to have his own version
of one on ones with individuals of his cohort. When it comes to coding, he just
needs to slow down and realize that he is on the right track. When communicating
build the preface to the problem you are working on.
Otherwise he’s got the chops."

### Playing a Part

* On Monday, July 27th, I had my blog post ("The Difference is Huge") included
in that week's Posse Post as well as being featured on the Turing Blog.
* On Friday, July 3rd, I helped cater Andrew's City of Cuernavaca Park picnic.
