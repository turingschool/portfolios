# (Ryan Asensio) - (M1) Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module, I set out to test my limits in the depth and speed of learning.
I learned the basics of programming in Ruby, how to use GitHub, and how
relational databases are designed and implemented.

### End of Module Assessment

Ruby Syntax & API: 4
Ruby Style: 3
Blocks & Enumerations: 4
Testing: 3
Workflow: 3+
Collaboration: 4

### Attendance

I have kept a clean attendance record for the entirety of the module.

### Work

Following is a list of my individual and pair projects, completed in Module 1.
Projects are listed in chronological order, the most recent being located at the
bottom.

#### (Robodoku)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rasensio1/Robodoku.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/robodoku.markdown)

This was our first project. We were asked to create a program that solves
sudoku puzzles. Although I successfully implemented this functionality, the
ruby syntax and style, demonstration of the SRP and DRY code, file organization,
test coverage and proper use of github was significantly lacking.


Evaluation scores (out of 4)

Functional Expectations: 3.5
TDD: 3
Encapsulation: 3
Fundamental Ruby: 4
Enumerable: 3

#### (Binary Search Tree)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rasensio1/Binary_search_tree)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/data_structures_and_algorithms/tree/master/binary_trees)

Our second project asked for the implementation of a Binary Search Tree, a data
structure that allows for fast searching in a Set of data. I was able to
solidify my understanding of recursive methods and improve on all aspects of
effective coding (syntax/style, SRP, DRYness, TDD, GitHub, file org, etc.)

Instructor Comments:

Program works
One extension - Max Depth
Clean code, some opportunities for refactoring, splitting out to separate methods.
Score:

Evaluation Scores:

Functional Expectations: 3.5
TDD: 3
Encapsulation: 3
Fundamental Ruby and Style 3.5
Enumerable and Collections: 3

#### (Enigma)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rasensio1/Enigma.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/enigma.html)

The goals of this project was to create an application that encrypts, decrypts
and cracks codes like the historical Enigma machine. Although my program was
fully functional, some aspects of TDD were missing, as well as best-choice
enumerable methods and demonstration of the SRP principle.

Instructor Comments:

Program encrypts
program cracks
program cracks in under a second
good integration tests
messy god object with main
file IO could have been broken out

Evaluation Scores:

Functionality: 4
Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2
Test-Driven Development: 3
Breaking Logic into Components: 2.5


## Team

### Projects

Following is the only group project for this module.

#### (Project Name)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/philmphoenix/sales_engine_pivot.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/sales_engine.html)

This project was intended to demonstrate the inner-workings of a relational
database. Our program had good functionality and speed, but was lacking in unit
tests and violated the SRP. Additionally, we used .each where more
appropriate methods were available.

Instructor Comments:

91 tests with 95.44% coverage
Needs unit tests in all repositories, too much dependence on integration and feature tests.
Spec harness runs in 2 minutes and 12.5 seconds.
Would like to have seen mocks used to test relationships.

Evaluation Scores:

Functional Expectations: 3
Test-Driven Development: 3
Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
Enumerables and Collections: 3
Code Sanitation: 4

I was paired with Justin Holzmann on this project. Overall, we had a very
enjoyable pairing experience. We had a great balance of driving/navigating
and a harmony between our work ethic and styles. The only negative feedback from
Justin was that we needed to focus more on testing. While pairing, we both
neglected writing unit tests for every method, and were subsequently docked for
this defeciency.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I know that I could have spent more time helping my peers this module. Having
family, friends and my own routines to keep up with, I often chose to spend
my free time outside of Turing. Knowing this, I decided to spend several hours
at Turing over the weekend, to help others with their sales engine projects.

Feedback I received from others includes that I need to be a better communicator
while pairing. Next module, I will be sure to ask my pairing partners if I am
communicating effectively. I think my biggest weakness is running with ideas
before making sure the other party understands where it is going. On the other
hand, people were very grateful for help troubleshooting that I gave on Sales
Engine and other assignments.

### Playing a Part

I emptied and refilled at least 8 dishwashers this module.
I made my free time available for other students to ask for help on various
projects.
I helped organize the happy-hour for incoming Module 1 students.
I organized an out-of-class BBQ for any interested Turing students.
I stayed up until 2:30 helping people with their sales engine projects.
