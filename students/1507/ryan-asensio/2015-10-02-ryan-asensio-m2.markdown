# Ryan Asensnio - Module 2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I entered this module with a strong finish to the previous one. My goal was to get a thorough grasp of the taught concepts, as well as explore some other technical interests. Overall, I accomplished the first goal, but slid a little on the second. Due to the group projects, I did not have much time to spare for the majority of the module. I did, however, improve my group working and leadership skills. By working in two groups of 4, it challenged me to become a better communicator and stronger leader.

### End of Module Assessment

My progress through the module was assessed by Tess and the results follow:

""

* Satisfactory progress 
* Ruby styniax and style 
* Rails style and api 
* Testing 3.5
* User interface 3

### Projects

There were no individual projects this module

Following are the two group projects completed this module.

#### Traffic Spy 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/roseak/traffic_spy)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

  This project was challenging because of the concetps, as well as the group dynamic(intially).We implemented a site traffic tracker and analysis tool. 

Functional Expectations: 3
Test-Driven Development: 4
Encapsulation / Components: 3
Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3

##### My Contribution

  My contribution to this project was mainly as a guide for the team. We paired through the entire project, and my pair and I implemented the logic behind the url-specific data. This consited mainly of SQLite querires using the Sequql gem.


##### Takeaway

  * Group dynamics can make or break a team
  * I problem-solve best on my own 
  * Mob coding can be very frustrating 

#### Little Shop of Orders (FasterFood)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rasensio1/faster_food)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

  This project was a lot of fun. Our group of four was tasked to build an e-commerce site, where a user can add items to a cart and check out. There is also additional Admin functionality, use of 3 different APIs and front-end that isn't too bad. This project was fun, because the technical challenges weren't demoralizing, and yet, we put in a lot of good work. 


  * Production Performance: 
  * Load Testing: 
  * DB Scale: Check
  * Testing: 
  * Code Quality: 
  * Additional Features: 

##### My Contribution

I was the team lead for this project. I set a very general scope and path for us to take in impementing the project. Code-wise, I implemented CRUD functionality for multiple models, the cart, added ActiveRecord Relationships, set up correct routing paths, added front-end design using boostrap templates and custom css, and implemented an API to calculate item delivery time. Additionally, I was the "unsticker" of the group --helping people get past walls and pulling the group out of the weeds, when we were deep in a problem.

##### Takeaway

  * Stamina is important
  * A good leader facilitates others' progress
  * Deployment can be mysterious

### Playing a Part

  I emptied and refilled ~5 dishwashers this module. Not too bad, but not as good as last module. I helpled out a 1508 student on several occasions in the first few weeks. I addented DSA a few times. I brought breakfast the second-to-last friday for the school. I gave a pretty cool lightning talk about cheese. Will do another in the same style next module.
