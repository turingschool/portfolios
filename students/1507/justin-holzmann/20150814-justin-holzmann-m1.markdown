# Justin Holzmann - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

* Learn Vim to improve and optimize work flow.
* Fix my personal habit structures (the first time I did module 1 I lost many of
the positive habits that I had spent the previous year building).
* Read 4 books on Ruby to match my year long goal of 12 Ruby books.
* Do all extensions on projects assigned.
* Practice pairing.
* Adobt a morning practice routine before school.

### Attendance

Perfect attendance except for Wednesday, July 29th when I wasn't feeling well.

### Work

* I've heard Jeff oftentimes mention that "time is the easy lever". Since day 1
I've tried to push that lever as much as possible. In terms of raw hours I think
I at least rival the hardest workers in the program.
* 9 levels of Vim Adventures game
* Went through Josh Cheeks Ruby katas at least once per kata
* Started reading Ruby documentation as per Josh M's recommendation in final
assessment from 1505
* Practiced Hashes in all projects (instead of arrays)
* Read The Little Book of Talent
* Listened to The Talent Code


### Projects

I worked on the following projects over the course of the module

#### (Robodoku)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/philmphoenix/robodoku)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/robodoku.markdown)

  This project was an automatic sudoku solver (load in a puzzle and it solves it).
  I was assessed by Jeff and these were his comments and scores:


  "Some tests and some decent implementation but doesn't quite work."

  "Could use refactoring, especially of conditionals-in-conditionals."


  * Functional Expectations: 1
  * TDD: 2
  * Encapsulation: 2
  * Fundamental Ruby: 2
  * Enumerable: 2


#### (Enigma)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/philmphoenix/enigma-2.0)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/enigma.html)

  A software spin on the original encrypting and decrypting messaging platform
  that the German army used in WWII. Very fun project. I focused on using hashes
  as per my module goals and on using as many classes as possible.

  This is also the first project in module 1 where Jeff started "client meetings"
  which is when Echo group would meet up and the scope of the project
  would change.

  * The first change was to add tons of other characters to the character map (including
  the new line character which screwed up many of my tests).
  * The second change was to add a 5th wheel to the rotation class. Given my
  design this was actually pretty difficult to do.

  I was assessed by Mike with the following comments and scores:

  "Encrypts and decrypts"
  "Crack does not work"
  "Needs better unit testing"
  "Believe the crack sent program into an infinite loop"

  * Functionality: 2
  * Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
  * Test-Driven Development: 3
  * Breaking Logic into Components: 3


#### (Sales Engine the SQL)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/philmphoenix/sales_engine_sql)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sales_engine_the_sql.markdown)

  Sales Engine the SQL was a second iteration on the below team project (Sales
  Engine). It was a solo project done in week 6.

  We had to take someone else's existing/finished sales engine and switch it
  over to SQL databases and querys.

  I was assessed by Mike with the following comments and scores:

  "Encrypts and decrypts"
  "Crack does not work"
  "Needs better unit testing"
  "Believe the crack sent program into an infinite loop"

  * Functionality: 2
  * Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
  * Test-Driven Development: 3
  * Breaking Logic into Components: 3


## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following pair project:

#### (Sales Engine)

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/philmphoenix/sales_engine_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/sales_engine.html)

  This two week long project was to build an ORM (object relationship mapper)
  similar in scope to a basic Active Record. It is tested against an alternate
  test suite known as "the spec harness".
  As part of the Echo group we also had a very significant client meeting
  assigned to us the Thursday of the first week. Before that time it had been a
  solo project.
  After the client meeting we were each assigned a partner and a different
  developers code base.
  One caveat: we were instructed not to change the code base until we got the
  spec harness to pass (we could only add to it).
  I was paired with Ryan Asensio and the code base we worked on was Russell
  Harms'.
  Russell was attempting to get as close to meta programming as was allowed by
  the rules laid down in the directions so the hardest part of the whole process
  was trying to keep track of what seemed strange and what seemed normal.

  I asked Ryan up front if we could pair for the whole project (or at least the
  majority of it) to practice pairing. He agreed and we ended up pairing for
  every line of code that was added to the project.

  "91 tests with 95.44% coverage"
  "Needs unit tests in all repositories, too much dependence on integration and feature tests."
  "Spec harness runs in 2 minutes and 12.5 seconds."
  "Would like to have seen mocks used to test relationships."

  * Functional Expectations: 3
  * Test-Driven Development: 3
  * Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
  * Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
  * Enumerables and Collections: 3
  * Code Sanitation: 4)

## Community

### Giving Feedback

A few of my fellow students had these things to say:

 * Justin's gone out of his way to stop what he's doing to come and help me and
 many other people with their various project issues.  He clearly explains
 what's going on and helps give light to the problems you're dealing with.
 * Your enthusiasm is infectious, pairing on OkCuGit was a great experience for
 me, it made my day.

### Playing a Part

This module I did a lightening talk.

I also tried to let other students feel completely welcome in coming up to ask
me for help on things they were struggling with. Many did so.
I always tried to keep in mind that just being given an answer is a really
shitty way to learn a thing and therefore it would be better if a student got at
least most of the way there themselves.

I tried to give real and actionable feedback on surveys to the staff.

I also tried to bring a positive, focused and yet fun vibe to every class I
attended.

I tried to share ideas and act on advice given to me by Jeff to play the part of
"the promoter" a little bit more.
