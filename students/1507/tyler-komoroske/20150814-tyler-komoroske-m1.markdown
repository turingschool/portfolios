# Tyler Komoroske - Module 1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Prior to this module, I had no knowledge of development, or really anything technical.
My goals coming into Turing were to put as much time in as I possibly could and retain as much information as I could possibly learn. Througout the module I made a continuous effort to make sure I was putting in the time and effort to be successful.

### End of Module Assessment

My progress through the module was assessed by Jeff Casimir and
here are the
results:

## Scores

* Ruby Syntax & API 2
* Ruby Style 3
* Blocks & Enumerations 3
* Testing 3
* Workflow 3
* Collaboration 3

## Attendance

I missed 2 days throughout the module and that was due to a family wedding in New York.

## Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tjkomor/chisel.git)
* [Original
Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1507/challenges/chisel.markdown)


* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2
* Test-Driven Development: 2
* Functionality: 1
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Linked Lists

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tjkomor/linked_lists.git)
* [Original
Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown)

During this project I attemtped to implement a linked list.
This was
a tough project for me as I had a tough time implementing
code.

* Functional Expectations: 1
* Test-Driven Development: 1
* Encapsulation: 2
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2
* Looping / Recursion: 1


## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Enigma

https://github.com/tjkomor/enigma.git

During this project, Travis and I were able to work as a
team to
deliver an Enigma machine that met functionality
expectation.

* Functionality: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

Feedback from Travis:

Positives: Tyler was super engaged in working as a team on the project, and was ready and willing to put in the extra work to make sure we delivered an end product that met the spec we were given. He was also really active in the ideation process of figuring out what we needed to do to solve the problems that we had to tackle.

Areas for Growth: Tyler was a little shakey with how to implement our ideas in code in terms of syntax, and also with how information flowed between methods and classes. This made me feel like I had to drive most of the implementation of our project which I was happy to do, but didn’t make for a totally equal pair. His workflow needed to be faster, especially navigating the keyboard using shortcuts.

#### Sales Engine

Jeff and I were able to break this project down into
small components
and developer a weel-oiled sales engine.


* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 4
* Code Sanitation: 3

### Feedback to me

Feedback from Jeff:

Alright, here’s some feedback for you. I liked how you were always ready and willing to get to work, you had a very solid work ethic. I also thought that communication was good, we were both pretty on top of when and where we would get to work. As far as things you could work on, I think it would be helpful to work on breaking down problems into really small parts and working on those. It seems like you can get overwhelmed if a problem seems too big.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* I always gave actionable and useful feedback to all classmates when asked or given the opportunity.

Here are some of the examples of feedback I gave to Jeff and Travis during module 1.

Travis:

Positives: Travis was an awesome partner to have for Enigma. He was very flexible when it came to meeting up to get some work done, and showed dedication and determination to produce great work. He was an excellent teacher throughout the coding process. I typically struggle with code implementation and Travis always took the time to make sure I understood the code before moving on to the next task. Very effective communicator as well.

Areas for growth: Travis generally handled most of the code implementation, which was definitely partly because he was much better at implementing code than I was. But I do wish that I had more of a chance to actually write our code base. I chose not to speak up due to time constraints and I wanted to make sure we had a working product. Maybe in the future it might be a good idea for Travis to let others do more of the driving.

Jeff:

Positives: Jeff was a great partner. He was very flexible when it came to meeting times and was always willing to put in the necessary work to get the project done. He was an excellent communicator and was good at breaking down big problems into small components. I definitely learned alot from doing Sales Engine with Jeff and I have a stronger understanding of OOP because of it.

things to work on: There were many times where Jeff would write a bunch of code without saying why he was doing it. However, every time I stopped him he would always take the time to explain. There were also times where I would ask him a question and he would be thinking alot in his own head that he hadn't even realized I asked a question.

### Playing a Part

* During this module, I defintely did not have a chance to be as involved as I would have liked to have been.
* I was always willing to help anyone with whatever they may have needed help with, but because I wasn't one of the stronger students in the cohort, people tended not to ask me for help.
* I always liked to ask my classmated how they were doing and if they needed help to let me know.
* I made an effort to come to Turing everyday with a smile on my face and take on every challenge with a positive attitude regardless of how overwhelmed I may have felt.
* I'm going to make an effort to be mre involved next module and help out in any way I can.
