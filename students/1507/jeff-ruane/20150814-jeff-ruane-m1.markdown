# Jeff Ruane - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I wasn't sure what I was really getting into, I set out to learn Ruby, and while I certainly haven't mastered
it, I think I've set a good foundation. After Chisel, I wanted put an emphasis on TDD, and I think I've improved
there.

### End of Module Assessment

I was assessed by Josh Cheek and got the following scores:
Assessed by Josh Cheek on 10 Aug 2015

1. Ruby Syntax & API     : 3

  * Knew what you wanted to use and where to get it

2. Ruby Style            : 4

  * Best looking code I've seen today (simple style things)
  * Solutions were elegant (not annoyingly verbose)

3. Blocks & Enumerations : 3

  * Good guess on count (the name and how to invoke it)

4. Testing               : 3+

  * Has the header info memorized (ie can write a test without referencing a bunch of stuff)
  * Had a good understanding of how the pieces mapped together

5. Workflow              : 3+

  * Custom aliases (mkcd)

6. Collaboration         : 3.5

  * Seem to be on the same page after initial assessment of the challenge
  * Enjoyed working with you :)

### Attendance

I had no absences or tardies this module.

### Work

This module I worked on Chisel and Linked Lists individually.

#### Linked List

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbrr/linked_list)  
[Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown)

In this project, I implemented a linked list data structure in Ruby.

I was evaluated by Jeff and got the following scores:

1. Functional Expectations                       : 3
2. Test-Driven Development                       : 3
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style                      : 3
5. Looping *or* Recursion                        : 3

Notes: Testing could using more edge cases, implementation is strong, but could use some refactoring.

#### Chisel

[GitHub ](https://github.com/jbrr/chisel)  
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

In this project, I made a program to convert markdown to HTML.

I was evaluated by Mike and got the following scores:

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style       :3
2. Test-Driven Development        :2
3. Functionality                  :3
4. Breaking Logic into Components :3

It wasn't strong on TDD, and I made that a goal for later projects.

## Team

### Projects

I worked on Enigma and Sales Engine as team projects this module.

#### Sales Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tjkomor/sales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sales_engine.markdown)

In this project, we created a program to parse through several data types and draw relationships between them.

Notes:

* 162 tests
* Spec Harness runs 3 minutes 38 seconds
* No tests for loaders
* good use of enumerables
* some missing unit tests
* good use of memoizations
* 4 sanitation complaints
* overall clean
* some repetition of code


1. Functional Expectations                       : 3
2. Test-Driven Development                       : 3
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 4
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style                      : 3
5. Enumerable & Collections                      : 4
6. Code Sanitation                               : 3

Feedback from Tyler:
"Positives: Jeff was a great partner. He was very flexible when it came to meeting times and was always willing to put in the necessary work to get the project done. He was an excellent communicator and was good at breaking down big problems into small components. I definitely learned a lot from doing Sales Engine with Jeff and I have a stronger understanding of OOP because of it.

Things to work on: There were many times where Jeff would write a bunch of code without saying why he was doing it. However, every time I stopped him he would always take the time to explain. There were also times where I would ask him a question and he would be thinking a lot in his own head that he hadn't even realized I asked a question."

#### Enigma
* [Github URL](https://github.com/Unsafepond/Enigma-new)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

In this project, we recreated the famous Enigma machine, and used it to encrypt and decrypt messages.

I was evaluated by Josh with the following scores:

1. Functionality                 : 2
  * No cracking
2. Fundamental Ruby and Style    : 3+
  * Like the "function objects" ie decryptor
  * The binary was nice
3. Test-Drive Development        : 3
  * When something is difficult to test, identify what is making it difficult and push that higher in the callstack (ie stdin/stdout are provided by the test / binary, and then we can give it a version that records what was printed and provides the input that the tests want to give it)
4. Breaking Logic into Components: 3+

I recieved the following feedback from my partner: "He's very kind and productive."

## Community

"Jeff is a great paring partner, reliable posse member, and always pleasant to work with. I'm glad we're in the same posse." - Adam Caron

### Giving Feedback

I have given feedback to both of my project partners, and to a handful of other people in my cohort and others.

### Playing a Part

I'm not generally the most outgoing person, and it takes me a while to get comfortable in a new environment. Also,
being in the first module, and being new to programming, I didn't really have the tools to help people out, although
I was always willing to help people if I could. I attending a handful of after school sessions, and helped clean up the
space when it was my posse's turn to do so. In addition, I've volunteered to help get 1508 prepared during the off week.
