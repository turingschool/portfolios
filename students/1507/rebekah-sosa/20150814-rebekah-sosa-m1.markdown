# Rebekah Sosa - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Prior to joining Turing, I had no programming experience. During the first
module I've learned to break problems down into smaller components, utilize an
iterative process to map out a solution and to implement the solution through
test-driven design. Through a lot of trial and error, I've come to understand that
learning to program requires a logical process, a supportive learning environment,
and a strong determination to learn.

### End of Module Assessment

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of an
absence on Friday, July 17th.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Sales Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rebekahsosa/SalesEngine)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/sales_engine.html)

In this ten-day project I implemented a data reporting tool that manipulates and
reports on merchant transactional data. It was evaluated by Mike Dao with the
following results:

* Ruby Syntax: TBD
* Decomposition: TBD
* Functionality: TBD
* Test-Driven Development: TBD

### Team Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

### Enigma

https://github.com/rebekahsosa/enigma

In this week-long project I built a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.
It was evaluated by Jeff Casimir with the following results:

* Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4

## Community

### Women in tech

I'm new to Denver and focused on strengthening relationships with
women in the tech community:

* I attend private events and meetups with students at Turing
* I pair frequently with professional mentors as well as students
