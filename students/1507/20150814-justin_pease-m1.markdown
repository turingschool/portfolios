### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module for the second time I was both nervous and excited.  I was excited to start over with out having to think about how to use a mac, or what an editor is.  There was so much information my brain had to wrap around the first time it was difficult to focus on the lessons and the language and logic of ruby.  This time I was able to focus on the content and although I was nervous that maybe I just wouldn't get it.......I do get it.  I am excited to have started this chapter of my life by attending Turing and and I move into the next 3 modules I really look forward to not just my own education here but also what I can give back to the students and the school.

### End of Module Assessment

## Notes

* Pretty decent syntax and problem solving

### 2. Ruby Style

* 3: Developer writes code that is easy to follow

### 3. Blocks & Enumerations

* 3: Developer demonstrates understanding of blocks and can effectively use enumerable methods

### 4. Testing

* 3: Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks

### 5. Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### 6. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking *before* attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### Attendance

This module I have not missed any classes or been late.  

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### SalesEngine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NicoleHall/sales-engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sales_engine.markdown)

Sales Engine is a program that is able to aggregates business intelligence from CSV files that contain data regarding merchants, customers, invoices, invoice items, items, and transactions and can compile the data in many useful ways.

11:30 - Nicole Hall, Justin Pease

  1. Functional Expectations
  * Much of the business logic was not completed.
  2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes

  2. Test-Driven Development
  * Tests were strong, but relied on the greater data set too much. A bit more
  understanding of the benefits and use of a setup method could have helped.
  3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration
  tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

  3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  * Aside from the test suite, the components were split up and easily readable.
The code is repository code is ready for a module, but the group ran out of
time.
  3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the
  principle of SRP

  4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  * Only one solid sweep of refactoring would have made this into a very elegant
  program.
  3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and
  refactoring

  5. Enumerable & Collections
  * Not much Business Logic completed, but the parts which were completed were
  done so with good enumerables.
  3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

  6. Code Sanitation
  * Had not ran rake sanitation:all yet. Most violations could be fixed easily.
  1: More than ten complaints

#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jpease1020/Chisel1.2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

Chisel is a program that takes a markdown text file and pareses it into html text.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jpease1020/Linked_Lists)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown)

Linked Lists are one of the most fundamental Computer Science data structures. A Linked List models a collection of data as a series of "nodes" which link to one another in a chain.

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### (Enigma)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jpease1020/Enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/a5c68d5a08edd80f3de1cc6550b1576f982268a8/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

#### Notes
* Does all the things (might be nice to get error messages on missing inputs)
* A few indentation issues
* Nice using mrspec!
* Pretty good abstractions
* You probably don't need that many classes ;)

#### Scores

* Functionality:
  * Score: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style:
  * Score: 3
* Test-Driven Development:
  * Score: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components:
  * Score: 3

## Community

I participated in th 3D printing class where Jamie Kawahara helped me print an "Optimus Prime" head for my nephew who loves the transformers.  Thanks Jamie!

### Giving Feedback

### Feedback Received

"I cannot say enough about your effort and support during The Sales Engine project.  We began by building out the repositories, the FileI/O interface and some basic searching and sorting methods.  We had a conversation to DTR and discuss our expectations from the project and from each other.  As we continued to work, you were clear about the devision of work.  I continued with repositories and testing while you began on relationships.  We worked well together over the weekend."

### Playing a Part

I tried very hard to reach out and make my own connections and be part of the community on a social level.  This is not an easy thing for me.  I have always struggled to connect well with my peers but I also have a very keen awareness of the importance of community and the impact of relationships an a persons growth and development.  Knowing what it is like to struggle to connect with the people and classmates around you, I tried to be aware of anyone else who seems to keep to themselves or may be a little on the shy side and engage them and offer my friendship to them.  I did find it difficult to participate in this way as I would have liked to due to the tremendous workload here.  I sincerely hope as my time here progresses I am able to increase this role of reaching out to others.
