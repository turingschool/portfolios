### Areas of Emphasis

I wasn't sure what to expect going into Module 2 as I had anticipated more time
spent on algorithms and coding than on handling servers and requests. My main
goal going in was to deeply understand the fundamentals and emphasize learning
good backend practices.

I was present all days and late on one day though I don't recall which.

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Traffic Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mcschatz/traffic_spy)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/traffic_spy.markdown)

This project required us to build a web app that was capable of receiving data
and organizing that data using Sinatra and Active Record.

Team: Mimi Schatz, Alon Waisman, Jeff Ruane, Michael Wong

Assessed by: Josh M.

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation / Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
* View Layer: 4

I was told that my ability to be calm and clear were enviable but that I could
have taken more initiative to experiment when driving. Aside from that, the
feedback was positive and everyone said they would pair again without a doubt.

#### Little Shop of Orders

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rasensio1/faster_food)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

This project was to produce an E-commerce site that used Rails and Active Record
to control a database and a users' ability to interact with the data following
the MVC architecture.

Team: Ryan Asensio, Justin Holzmann, David Stinette, Michael Wong

Notes:




My team said they really enjoyed working with someone willing to experiment as
long as we followed proper git and waffle workflow to isolate code playgrounds.
Feedback was very positive but everyone made it easy to work alongside each
other.

I wanted to let you know that I really enjoyed pairing with you! You have a
calm but good energy and you have excellent instincts. Definitely felt like we
accomplished a lot whenever we paired together. - Justin Holzmann

## Community

### Giving Feedback

The feedback I gave was for my partners of both projects, Traffic Spy and Little
shop. There was mostly praiseworthy feedback as everyone I worked with was able
to speak up and correct any issues or misunderstandings right away. I would pair
with any one of them again without hesitation.

### Playing a Part

I'm not too sure that I played a big role in the Turing community this module.
Trying to be friendly and welcoming with the new cohort to ease their
transition possibly?
