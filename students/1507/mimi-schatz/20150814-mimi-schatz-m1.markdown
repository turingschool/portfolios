# Mimi Schatz - Module: 1 Portfolio

## Individual

## Areas of Emphasis

As someone who knew very little before starting school, my plan was to be as open and to learn as much as possible over the course of these 6 weeks. Moreover, I wanted to reassure myself that this is, in fact, the best career path for me. I do think these first 6 weeks have been successful despite some early challenges. As a new student, I also wanted to meet and get to know the other students. This program gives me a unique opportunity to focus all of my energy on learning and developing. I hope I can continue to stay focused on this as I move forward.

#### Notes:

* Mimi is noticeably on track to become a skilled Rubist.
* She works at a fast pace, sometimes getting ahead of herself and her tests,
but she had no issue knowing what to do next.
* She chose the correct enumerables on the first attempt and had no issues
implementing them at her usual pace.

#### Scores:

* Ruby Syntax & API - 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby
* Ruby Style - 3: Developer writes code that is easy to follow
* Blocks & Enumerations - 4: Developer is able to consistently select and implement the best-choice enumerator methods with blocks
* Testing - 3: Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks
* Workflow - 4: Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development
* Collaboration - 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### Attendance

I attended class every day except for Friday, July 31st.

### Work

Below is a list of all projects and their scores for Module: 1.

## Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mcschatz/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

This was a week long project where we built a program that could convert a Markdown file to a HTML file.

Assessed By: Mike Dao

#### Notes:

* Opens file, saves to file.
* Bare testing, program was restarted.
* Some opportunities to use better enumerables.

#### Scores:

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 1
* Functionality: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

## LinkedList

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mcschatz/linked_list)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown)

In this assignment we built a linkedlist.

Assessed By: Mike Dao

#### Notes:

* Could have used tail method to refactor append and other methods.
* Liked how #count calculated count and an instance variable wasn't incremented everywhere.

#### Scores:

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping / Recursion: 3

## Projects

### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mcschatz/enigma_pair_project)(https://github.com/selfup/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

In this project we used Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.

Assessed By: Josh Cheek

#### Notes:

* Use the interface before it exists, so that you can discover what it should be. This will lead to elegance.
* Prefer interfaces where there is no way for the object to be used wrong (ie don't let other objects coordinate the methods of this object). If the object is a verb (crack, encrypt, decrypt -- vs key, date, etc), choose interfaces like "here are your inputs, give me the output", this omits "state" (instance variables) and thus will lead to the above suggestions.
* Examples: Crack.new(encrypted_message).crack or, given the "functions" style we talked about during modules yesterday: Crack.call(encrypted_message)

#### Scores:

* Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3-
* Breaking Logic into Components: 2

## SalesEngine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mcschatz/sales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sales_engine.markdown)

In this project we practiced building a system of several interacting Ruby objects using TDD.

Assessed By: Mike Dao

#### Notes:

* 98 percent test coverage, 179 assertions.
* Spec harness runs in 4 minutes, 2.9 seconds (2:09 on Bret's computer. Darn Mike and his pinterest.)
* 1 violation sanitation
* sales_engine_test - empty
* empty test
* Good handling of edge cases in code and in tests
* Better unit tests needed

#### Scores:

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3
* Code Sanitation: 4

"Mimi was a great partner to work with. She stayed focused and worked diligently towards a successful completion of Sales Engine(SE). I had trouble understanding some of the more complex parts of SE but Mimi was willing to be patient and explain each part’s complexity while at the same time keeping us on track to finish.  A+ partner! I hope to pair again!"

## Community

#### Feedback to me

"Hi Mimi! First and foremost, I appreciate the good natured attitude you bring with you each day to Turing. I see you applying yourself well during the times I see you working. When you asked for help, you did a good job of paying attention to the assistance given whether it was from myself or another. From what I gathered from your Sales Engine teammate, you were doing a good job of keeping up with the workflow and challenging yourself!"

"Always in a positive mood and keeps the vibe of the cohort in good spirits. I was very impressed with your work on Chisel you left Turing on Friday with not much of a start. By Monday, you had a working markdown-to-html converter. You demonstrated grit and determination with the successful completion of the project."

"Mimi is a pleasure to pair with. She makes sure to go through and map out a problem first before attacking it. She makes a habit of writing her tests first before implementing the code, and the code that she writes is easy to understand. When pairing she makes sure everyone’s on the same page. She’s good at being even keeled, not getting too worked up about a problem, continuing to push till she figures out a solution. Considering where she started when the module began, it’s pretty remarkable how far she’s come. Please pair us. :)"

#### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Attended Boulder Ruby Meetup on July 21, 2015.
* Attended Women Who Code Ruby Study group on July 15, 2015.
* Organized 2 happy hours for 1507.
* Organizing the introduction class and happy hour for 1508.
* Gave an interview for the weekly Turing update email.
