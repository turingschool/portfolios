# Andrew Carmer - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I focused a lot on Javascript this module and the end of the last. I'm comfortable with testing Javascript now, though I still need some work. I feel competent with JavaScript at this point, but I still get stumped sometimes. I think this is how my relationship with JavaScript will always be, but I'm excited to start building some new things.


### End of Module Assessment

This was an interesting project. 24 hours is not enough time to do things the 'right' way, but it was cool to see what we could do in a short period of time. I think I did pretty well, but my javascript could have been abstracted a little more, been a little more dry etc. My scores we Strait three's, and once pending two because I had issues with my mailer. By issues I mean I accidentally pushed my password to gihub and someone stole my account and sent 80k emails from my account at 3:30 in the morning. I finally got that sorted out when the new account I made was verified. 

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of an absence on Friday, July 10th and Friday August 7th.

### Work

Scale up was an individual project that focused on learning and experimenting with performance measuring tools and enhancement techniques. My attempt at this project fell short of where I would have liked it to. That being said I did learn a lot and I feel like I have a good grasp on the dos don'ts and what to look for when it comes to performance optimization.

#### Scale-Up

* github.com/carmer/scale-up
* HubStub

Steve evaluated me on this project. He would agree I didn't quite hit the mark on completeness. However, as a cohort, I believe that we all fell short of expectations in part to the amount of set up work there was. Steve told me he could see I had a grasp on the subject, but was disappointed I didn't make it further.

My scores are not on the ruby submissions section of Turing. But I received all 2's on this project.

## Team

### Projects

Tetris was a group project I worked on with Kristina Brown and Kenny Chen. We attempted to build Tetris in JavaScript, an ambitious undertaking, and fell just short of completion.

#### Game Time: Tetris

* github.com/carmer/tetris

A 'disco' version of a classic game.

We did fairly well at our attempt to build Tetris. We fell into some holes and due to that we fell short of a completed game. Overall, our code was decent and we learned a lot while test driving our JavaScript development.

Jeff evaluated our project and gave us decent scores.
We got all 3's on this project.

(feedback to me)


#### Mastery Project: Turing Scavenger Hunt

* github.com/carmer/scavenger-hunt

A scavenger hunt app for the Turing scavenger hunt.

We did really well at this project. We used websockets, node, express and a rails backend to implement a pub/sub model which keeps track of team submissions.

We were evaluated by Jorge. Our scores were 4, 3.5 3, 2, 4.

## Community
I generally love being a part of the Turing community. I can tell it is evolving, and change is inevitable, but I hope we can remain a tight knit community even while we grow. I think the team building activities we do occasionally are a good thing, but I think talking more about the importance of our community during wrap-up etc is a good idea. I am a little disappointed in the lack ownership of the space sometimes. I know with all that happens and the stress that sometimes the last thing on peoples mind is cleaning up, but it's important and if it is done it can make people have more pride in their space.

### Giving Feedback
I give people honest and generally direct feedback when asked, occasionally unsolicited as well. I always try to interact with people in a direct, honest respectful manner, so and I hope people can see my feedback for them always comes comes from a genuine place.


### Playing a Part

I do dishes, pickup and generally try to keep the basement in order on a near daily basis. I help students after class and during the day whenever I'm asked for help. I regularly do Friday breakfasts. I try to organize events for us all to do outside of turing. I'm sure there are other things I do too, but I'm not very good at keeping track. Kristina has been saying to me, "Put that in your portfolio", whenever I do things, but I usually forget what those things are. I do always bring a lot of water to outdoor get togethers. I've also helped organize 3 incoming happy hours. My crowning accomplishment however, is the plethora of high-fives I give on a daily basis. Admittedly, a few of those may be uncomfortably long or awkward.
