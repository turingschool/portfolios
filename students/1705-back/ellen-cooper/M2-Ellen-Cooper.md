# Ellen Cooper - M2 Portfolio

-----------------------

## A: Personal Growth

## Areas of Emphasis

This mod I set out to gain a solid foundation in rails and the skills required for basic web applications, and best practices.

## Areas of Growth

Of the topics we covered this mod I'd say the hardest to grasp was the "how the internet works" theme that was covered over the first week (with exception of the basic HTTP request cycle, which I feel comfortable with). It's abstractness makes it hard for me to fully grasp without more detail and context. It is something I am interested in and would like to learn more about, however that knowledge doesn't seem like a requirement for most positions in the field.

I think I've grown in many ways this mod, as all the material was completely new to me coming in and I now feel I have a firm grasp on most of the major topics. I feel very comfortable with the MVC framework and how all the pieces fit together, as well as debugging. Similarly I feel confident with ActiveRecord, as well as testing. While the front-end skills were initially challenging, I now feel comfortable with the basic concepts and ready to learn more.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The projects this mod were a great learning opportunity and allowed for deeper exploration of the skill we were learning in class.

#### Bike-Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emcooper/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

In this project my team and I used Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.

Having just learned most of the technologies required for the project a few days before, my goal was to become more comfortable with CRUD in Sinatra, and ActiveRecord. My role included completing the Station and Weather dashboards, as well as Trip seeding. This project, along with the Mini-Project, were probably the biggest learning experiences of the mod and afterwards I felt much more comfortable with everything we had learned. A late night spent on the Weather Dashboard gave me a very solid foundation in ActiveRecord that stuck with me the rest of the mod. I was also the PM in this project which worked out well, because given the general group dynamics and the rushed nature of the project, that was the role I would naturally have played. Despite being separated most of the 4-day weekend, my team and I communicated really well and worked together efficiently to be one of the only groups to complete the project.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emcooper/fantasy_bachelor)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

I created a Fantasy League Application for the Bachelor franchise TV shows.

My project came out of an idea I had had since before Turing, and as such was very exciting and motivational. My goal for the project was to solidify my understanding of Rails, as well as to strengthen my front-end skills which I felt were lacking at that point, and to get started on a project that I knew I would want to eventually complete and deploy. I think I achieved these goals, and the extra motivation of working on my own project idea pushed me to explore new areas to achieve the vision I had for the site. Rather than just following the basic CRUD pattern I focused on what was needed for the application's core features and thought more about user experience, particularly with point entry functionality as I didn't want the user to be overwhelmed by filling out multiple forms. Coming out of the project I felt extremely comfortable with basic Rails apps and am excited to keep working on the project and incorporate new skills and knowledge as I go through Turing. The biggest lesson from the project was not to think too small in terms of database structure, even when aiming for the Minimum Viable Product.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/katiekeel/little-shop)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

In this project I used Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering.

Coming out of the mini-project I felt very comfortable with Rails, ActiveRecord and basic font-end skills so my goal in Little Shop was more focused on the workflow and getting used to working as part of a team, as well as strengthening a few new concepts such as the cart. My role was completing a variety of user stories, but our group worked together most of the time so the roles were less delineated. The pace of the project was much more relaxed than any other project this Mod, which was great because we were able to work together for most of the project, which allowed me to get more experience with pairing. The project was very successful due to a really effective and organized team and the extra time we had to add final touches.

## C: Final Assessments

(how did you do on written and timed independent?)
(was this a representation of your best work?)

I received 4's on both assessments, and I feel they were a representation of my best work.
