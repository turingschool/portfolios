## A: Personal Growth

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

I wanted to deepen my understanding of rails and develop the ability to deploy a functional website that provides a good user experience.

## Areas of Growth

(What did you struggle with most this module?)

While I have a good grasp of the basics of ActiveRecord, I want to be able to use
it to conduct sophisticated database queries. Redoing the ActiveRecord obstacles
course and some of the iterations in BikeShare will be helpful. I also want to
have a deeper understanding of how the internet works and develop a good sense for
what happens between the request and response cycle. Learning to use Capybara and
especially setting up FactoryGirl, were a challenge for me this module. But I'm
planning to dig more into FactoryGirl and use it more often.


(What areas did you grow in most this module?)

I really started to enjoy coding and got comfortable with tackling error messages.
I had a lot of fun doing homework and the class projects and it was awesome to see
what I and my teammates have built deployed on the live web. I had less doubts about my
ability to become a good developer this module and I made good use of google and
mentors/upper mod students when I run into issues that I was unable to fix. I also
asked questions in class and engaged more actively with what we were being taught.
What stands out the most for me is just how much I have enjoyed being a Turing student
this module and I am starting to love code and love Rails.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Bike-Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/yoasyo25/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment]()

(description)
Use Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share
usage in San Francisco.

(your goal and role in the project)

I knew this project would be an important building block for having a deeper
understanding of rails and I wanted to work on different features so that I could
have a solid start for when we got to learning about rails. I was able to work on
writing feature and model tests, creating ActiveRecord database queries, and some
work on the views. I didn't work that much on the seed file, but overall, I felt
like this project got me off to a good start for the module.  

(reflection on project)

The project went really well and I learned a lot about testing, ActiveRecord and
the MVC architecture. It was great to have a project manager to help keep us on
track and my teammates were all capable and very much committed to us meeting the
project spec. I felt like I made a good contribution to the project and learned
a lot in the process.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/yoasyo25/robo_matcher)
* [Ungraded personal project]

(Description)

The app sought to allow logged in robots to view each others' profiles and message
one another.

(your goal for the project)

I wanted to create a dating site for robots, based on some of the features that
sites like Match.com provide. Since we had not covered how to create an application
that allows users to message one another, I thought this would be a good opportunity
to learn something new.  

(reflection on project)

Overall, the project went well and it was great to work with Marc. After much
struggle with trying to incorporate a specific approach to messaging that we found
on medium.com, Marc and I decided to scrap that approach and try to implement
the feature in our own way. And with a lot of logic from Marc and help with debugging
from me, the messaging feature did work. This was a great learning experience on
how to integrate other people's approach to a specific feature into our own app.


#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/yoasyo25/little_shop)
* [Original Assignment]()

(Description)

Application uses Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate
online ordering

(your goal and role in the project)

I wanted to have a good understanding of sessions and admin features. I also wanted
to become more comfortable with CRUD and effectively using ActiveRecord.

(reflection on project)

We did a good job of staying on track on this project and all of us made solid
contributions that allowed us to meet the requirements of the spec. This being a
big project, there are certain features that I did not work on that I would like to
look over again so that I have a strong grasp of all parts of project.

-----------------------

## C: Final Assessments

(How did you do on written and timed independent?)

I got 3s on the written assessment and mostly 3s and a 2 for ActiveRecord Syntax
and Style on the timed assessment. The written assessment went well but I
panicked at the beginning of the timed assessment and it took me some time before I got
into a flow in order to effectively tackle the user stories. I am sure there is a
better approach to implement tagging than the one I used in the timed
assessment, but the tests pass and I did meet the expectations. I plan to
look at more effective ways to build associations and implement features such as
tagging.
