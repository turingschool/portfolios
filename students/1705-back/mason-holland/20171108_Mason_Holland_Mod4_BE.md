- Have a solid foundation for the job search 

## Assessment

Pass

* What was your biggest technical challenge? 

Honestly it feels like forever ago at this point. I remember it all being kind of tough and having to do a lot of googling. Nothing jumps out as being particularly tricky. Actually deploying to Github pages was a shit show. 

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I thought it was interesting and enjoyed it. I feel like we have all seen word maps a million times, but I never considered how I would tackle coding such a problem. I thought it was a nice challenge that was easy to wrap your head around. 

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

By googling anything I was unsure of and ensuring I was pragmatic about my approach.

* What did you learn?

Event listeners are neat and word maps are a silly concept. 

## Quantified Self

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Learning JavaScript paled in comparison to deploying the app. All our hard work was royaly broken. 

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

We solved this problem by being given an extra two days to work on it, which allowed us to figure out what we were doing wrong and deploy correctly. 

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

That I got to wrap my head around Javascript. 

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

- Event Listeners in earnest. 
- Asynchronous programming
- Promises
- JS

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

Would have loved to have completed the work earlier so I would have gotten more out of the refactor and testing lessons. As it was, I didn't give myself enough time and backloaded all my work and learning. 

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

I always enjoy pair projects. This one however did not involve much 'pairing' and we completed all our work while apart. We definitely could have had more valuable time working together. But I thought Wil was a great partner and very understanding. 

## Capstone Project

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Unity was foreign to me, as was C#.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

Tutorials and videos and documentation for days. Also a lot of playing around and scrapping of old work as I established better approaches and gained a deeper understanding of what exactly I was doing. 

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

So fun to work with my Brother on a project and it was awesome to make a game. That was something my brother and I had talked about since we were kids and I would not have had the ability or confidence to try and learn Unity before coming to Turing. 

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

- Unity
- Some C#
- Animation
- Rigidbodys
- Anima 2D

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

I received some valuable feedback in the form of a PIP and I done my best to step up in those areas and improve. Still struggling to get to bed on time though. 

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

I found this an enjoyable and ultimately rewarding process. I appreciated the opportunity to work with some of the front-enders, sadly it was not related to code. The most challenging part was maintaining peoples interest and trying to appear as an authority figure on the topic(You are LEADING the session after all). The most rewarding piece was everyones attitude upon attending the session. Everyone was lovely and polite and seemed genuinely interested in the subject matter. 

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

Have been fairly checked out of the large Turing community these last two modules, unsure where that died off. I really enjoyed pairing in mod 2 and 3 and helping out the earlier people, sadly I have let that slide in the formal sense. I still step in to help on any problem I can be of help on, but I have not put myself out there to help in a more official sense. I think this is a required part of the Turing experience as it is a huge part of what makes Turing so special. The community is one of the strongest components of Turing and I am dissapointed I didn't give back a little more this module and help out. I think being so removed from the rest of the school while in Mod 4 may play a part. 

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

hahaha is this a joke question?

- Programming
- Algorithmic thinking
- Ruby
- Rails
- JavaScript
- AJAX
- REST
- Web API's
- MVC
- TDD
- CRUD
- The ability to learn new things with far more ease
- The willpower to tackle large problems I do not know how to solve upon setting out

and countless other concepts that were utter gibberish to me before starting. 


## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md): 
* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.
* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
