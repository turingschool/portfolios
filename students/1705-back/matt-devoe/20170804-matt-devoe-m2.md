# Matt DeVoe - M2 Portfolio

-----------------------

## A: Personal Growth

## Areas of Emphasis

I learned way more this mod than I thought possible...

...Rails, Routes, Styling, UX, Database interactions, RSpec TDD, etc.

My goal entering Mod 2 was to do as well as possible. I didn't have any particular goals in mind other than learn, implement and retain whatever will be taught.

## Areas of Growth

Struggles - Most of my struggles revolved around styling. I avoided it like the plague until my Rails Mini-Project. I forced myself to use Bootstrap. While I learned a great deal about styling from the Mini-Project and Little Shop, I need more practice.

Growth Areas - As mentioned above, styling was definitely one area where I improved. I'm nowhere near where I'd like to be, but my comfort level drastically increased.

The biggest area where I've noticed general improvement is in understanding/grasping core concepts from Mod 1. Mod 1 was very difficult for me as Ruby seemed to exist in this abstract world. Once we started on Sinatra/Rails a lot of the fuzzy areas of Mod 1 became clear. Simple Ruby concepts in addition to higher level concepts (such as SRP, pushing logic down the stack and ORM) were solidified throughout Mod 2.


-----------------------

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I loved the approach to this Mod's projects and execution. The self-driven nature of the tutorials in combination with teacher instruction gave two effective ways to explore and execute concepts. Additionally, the group work and material were equally challenging and rewarding.

Of any realization from this mod, it's a personal one. If I'm working solo, I tend to go on a "hard burn" until the project is completed. Working with groups, I've been forced to back off and work tightly with the group, which is ultimately a good thing.

#### Bike-Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bretfunk/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

"In this project you'll use Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco."

My goals for this project included increased exposure and understanding of Database structures, ActiveRecord Method Calls, RESTful routes and styling.

On this project, I was the project manager for our group.

Overall, the project went well. There were plenty of obstacles that we, as a group, overcame. This includes not only the technical challenges, but issues that arose from the first time working in a group.

On a technical level, my understanding of databases, ActiveRecord, TDD using RSpec and RESTful application of resources definitely improved.

The group work, while challenging at times, was ultimately the most rewarding part. Balancing each group members needs and style with my own was more difficult than expected. In the end, the personal challenges were overcome and we hit the performing stage during the last third of the project.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mdevoe12/project-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

I chose Option 4: Original Idea that included:
Deploying to Heroku
Authentication/Authorization
One-to-many and Many-to-many relationships
Styling

My personal goals for this project included implementing and grasping Authentication and Authorization, executing a personal vision, styling and implementing my first API.

I really enjoyed this project and learned a ton about all of my above goals. I implemented the 'chartkick' gem in addition to google charts as my first API. It took a little configuration and experimentation, but using the API wasn't as nearly as difficult as I expected.

Authentication/Authorization became more concrete, but it didn't become a concept I could (most likely) implement on the fly without referring to documentation.

The styling portion was one of my major takeaways. As previously mentioned, I subconsciously (and consciously) steered myself away from styling until this project. It wasn't until the Sunday before the project was due that I used the power of bootstrap. Once I dove in, it wasn't bad at all and I learned a ton about proper styling techniques both from a UX and Bootstrap perspective.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/katiekeel/little-shop)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

"In this project youâ€™ll use Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering."

I was a contributer on this project, not the project manager. My goals were to gain more practice and experience in building a Rails project from scratch. My only specific goal was to learn more about sessions/carts/cookies.

This project was a close second to being my favorite of the mod. On a personal level, I feel as though I came into this project with a solid understanding of Mod 2 basics. There were challenging elements to the project (sessions, embedded forms for changing quantities, implementing certain add-on features), but I didn't feel as though I hit any insurmountable obstacles. I learned a lot more about sessions and carts, but still need a lot more work to master these concepts and their implementation.

On a group level, we had an excellent dynamic, personally and technically. Each of us brought strengths to the table that allowed us to learn and contribute to each other and the group as a whole.

## C: Final Assessments

Timed Independent Assessment:
3's and one 4.

Written Assessment:
3s

I feel as though I understood and was able to demonstrate understanding and execution of core fundamentals.

Is this representative of my best work?

This question is tough for me as I usually default to "no". There's always something I could have done better, studied harder for and thought about better during the assessment. That being said, I'm happy with my performance, but know that there are areas I would like to improve upon.

-----------------------

## D: Module Outcomes

I really enjoyed this module. The material was more concrete and, as previously mentioned, helped solidify previously abstract concepts from Mod 1. I feel like Mod 2 helped the rubber meet the road in terms of real world examples and production of applications. Thumbs up.

### Self-Assessed Outcome

Promoted:

I usually ere on the side of caution as I have a hard time gauging where I really sit. However, I feel as though I was able to grasp and utilize the core concepts that we covered in Mod 2.

That being said, there are many areas that I would like to improve upon. I don't have sessions down pat, my logic often lives too much in views or controllers, my ActiveRecord skills need to level up a bit more and my styling is almost solely dependent on frameworks at this point.
