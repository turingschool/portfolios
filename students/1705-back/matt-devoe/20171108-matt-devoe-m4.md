# Matt DeVoe - Mod 4 Portfolio

## Area of Emphasis

My primary goal for Mod 4 was to shift gears from RoR to Javascript. I wanted to learn as much JS as possible.

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

Pass

The largest technical hurdle entering Mod 4 was the shift from Ruby/Rails to Javascript. While this may not be too specific, the shift in mindset from coding in a familiar language to a new one is difficult. In a lot of ways, Mod 4 felt like Mod 1. Because my goal in Mod 4 was to learn as much JS as possible, I was up for the challenge. It sounds cliche, but I knew that if I put in the time and effort, I would learn and improve.

As far as what I learned specifically, there's a ton. Everything from basic syntax, to React, to Node, jQuery, Express, etc. I'm still at a basic level, but I feel equipped to dive deeper.

Out of the two assessments, the Javascript challenge was the more difficult. Due to our Hackathon project and attempting to finish Quanitified Self on time (I took the Express rebuild of the API), I did not touch client-side Javascript for nearly two weeks prior to the assessment. This backfired as I felt incredibly rusty going into the final Javascript assessment. I was able to pass the assessment, but I felt that I should not have struggled as much as I did.


## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

The biggest technical challenge was learning something new while trying to tackle what seemed like a large project at the time. Big issues we faced were trying to separate logic into separate files while getting these to load in a proper order. It took a while to whiteboard and figure out what was being loaded in what order and how to properly structure files.

However, I really enjoyed the logic portion of this. We knew this wasn't an impossible problem to solve. We slowly pieced together what we knew and where the delta was.

Three major technical concepts that I took away from QS were:
- Refactoring in JS (DRYing out code)
- ASync JS: I learned a ton about how JS/AJAX actually performs and returns ASync functions/methods
- Application Architecture: While not executed well in our project, I did come to realize how logical organization of JS code in file structures should be laid out.

The last piece would be the major area for refactor/change. Our file structure and code layout worked, but it wasn't ideal. If the project were to continue with another team, it would be confusing and difficult for them to hop into our code base.

Working with Michael on QS was a great experience. We both wanted to learn JS. It was difficult as we came into this project completely green. Since Mod 1, every pair/group had a balance of knowledge and expertise in Ruby. This was not true for this project. We both started from scratch.


## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

My biggest technical challenge on the Capstone was figuring out how to make all the pieces fit together into a seamless whole. Each individual piece had its own technical challenges, but I was working with several new technologies, unknowns and paradigms. Figuring out how to make all the information flow properly was a real, but fun challenge.

I was constantly whiteboarding and breaking down the issue. What were the known parts of the problem, what were the unknown parts? How might they fit together?

As far as new technical concepts, I learned a ton:
- My knowledge of the OAuth process expanded greatly
- React went from a nebulous concept to a technology that I'm really excited to learn about in the future
- Security was also a big part of this project. Creating and authenticating jason web tokens between two separate apps was incredibly valuable.


## Feedback

Our class discussion regarding communication was probably the most valuable feedback received this mod. In my previous professional life, I prided myself on communication ability. The discussion was a wake up call that I'm about to re-enter the professional world where clear and consistent communication with those up the hierarchy is essential. 

## Gear Up

Working with our Gear Up group was an enjoyable experience. Determining how to tackle our conceptual gear up and what to do to communicate was challenging. However, the most challenging part was actually executing the Gear Up. I forgot how stressed and burned out students usually are come week six of any mod. Trying to keep our fellow students engaged and on point with the topic was difficult. It required a lot of pivoting and probing questions during the actual session.

## Community Involvement

I worked to consistently pair and help students in other mods. This included consistent pairing with a mod 1 student. Helping mod 2 students on bizarre Rails issues and implement mod 3 concepts in their mod 2 projects.

## Going Forward

1. Feedback. Being able to receive and give well structured feedback is vital in any relationship (personal or professional).

2. "Well structured code" - This is a huge, open ended topic. Essentially, we're not writing code for ourselves in the present moment. We're writing code for our future selves and fellow developers. Make sure the code is concise, readable and makes sense.

3. Growth Mindset - I aim to bring the "not yet" mentality to wherever I end up. It goes without saying, but tackling problems, issues and building new things is difficult. Our attitudes and outlooks are often our biggest blockers. We will get to where we need to be with time, effort and grit.
