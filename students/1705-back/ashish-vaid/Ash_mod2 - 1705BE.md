## A: Personal Growth

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

The focus of mod 2 was to introduce us to the Rails framework and developing and deploying web applications. I was excited that this module would allow us to create simple, yet functional projects with a real world application to them. Throughout this experience, I've come to better understand the underlying logic and complexity it takes for an application to be effective, especially as I browse other sites for either classwork/homework, or personal leisure. 

## Areas of Growth

(What did you struggle with most this module?)
Styling was difficult for me when we first received the pre-work for mod 2. I had watched a few tutorials related to this prior to coming to Turing so I knew the very basics, but I knew that styling and front end development wasn't a strong interest area for me; however, I know and understand the importance of having a functional knowledge in this area so that any project
I may work will have at least some basic styling incorporated and not be visually too unappealing. Another area where I felt I struggled and at least had to follow guides to ensure I was doing the correct steps involved migrations. During each project, I found myself engaging with a migration error at least once which was frustrating since I understood the underlying logic of what was happening, but I was receiving an error due to either syntax issues, or other issues I was not immediately understanding.

(What areas did you grow in most this module?)

During the first week of mod 2, I was not fully understanding the CRUD functions and what they were doing. However, after the Bike Share project and subsequent exercises/projects, I came to 
grasp a much better understanding of what was going on. There was one class lecture in particular where we went through a thorough TDD process and added functionality from scratch to full CRUD for an application. It was an extremely beneficial lecture and perhaps one of my favorites from this module.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Bike-Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JF-Lalonde/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

(description)
Bike sharing app utilizing actual city data from SF Bay Area and parsing through it for creating an analytical dashboard.

(your goal and role in the project)
Goal was to better understand implementing full CRUD functionality and database migrations. There was a lot to absorb during the mod 2 pre-work and during the first week prior to 
this project being assigned. I felt this project would help to solidify some of my understanding of the concepts we were taught up to that point. I served as team leader for this project. 

(reflection on project)
I felt we had a very good group dynamic and there were no issues with regards to personality conflicts. We were all committed to wanting to do well on this project and willing to come in to Turing campus over the July 4th weekend in order to work together. I really appreciated my fellow team members’ willingness to do this since they likely had family or commitments to their significant other during that time.

The only negative I can think of that we encountered was right before our evaluation where a good amount of our feature tests were not passing anymore. We knew at some point we would have to change our suite as we progressed through creating some of the analytics, but failed to remember early enough to change the tests. As the "project manager" for this exercise, I felt I could've done a better job of organizing a block of time earlier enough in order to resolve this issue.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/swdonovan/moo_ni_project)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

(description)
Project was a cattle ranch management app. It was done in partnership with Wil Donovan. Project was to utilize one-to-many, many-to-many relationships, along with authorization/authentication, and styling. 

(your goal for the project)
Originally, I did not have an idea of my own that I would want to work on as an individual project. I was planning to use one of the predefined suggestions, but sitting next to Wil that day and seeing his ambitious personal project of his own creation was motivating, and I wanted to work on a potential real world application project in addition to refining the skills we had been taught up to that point.

(reflection on project)
It was great partnering on this project with Wil. I got much better at writing feature tests incorporating authentication/authorization and implementing CRUD. Even though we didn’t get to implement all the functionality we aimed for (which we knew would be the case from the beginning), it was great to see an app I contributed to that could be further refined and used one day.  


#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL]( https://github.com/Mcents/little_shop)
* [Original Assignment]( http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

(description)
ECommerce app that consists of authentication/authorization, many-to-many and one-to-many relationships, styling, and a “cart” object. 

(your goal and role in the project)
As our final project for mod 2, this project would have the most real world application relative to what we worked on thus far. It would be a project that I would want to showcase to others as an example of what I learned (initial modules) at Turing. My goal was to get exposure to each major component the project consisted of.

(reflection on project)
It was interesting to be paired with almost all the same people as the bike share project for this project. I felt we each knew each other’s personalities and work styles pretty well. My goal of getting exposure to all the different pieces of this project was something I almost achieved, which I was somewhat satisfied with, but given the timeframe we had I understand if I couldn’t achieve this goal.

-----------------------

## C: Final Assessments

(how did you do on written and timed independent?)
(was this a representation of your best work?)

As far as the written, I felt I did well. Always room for improvement, but I was mostly satisfied. Regarding the timed independent, I was not satisfied with my performance. Looking back, I made it more complicated than I should have over thinking what the goals were from the instructors. I did this during the mid-mod assessment as well where I was jumping in advance to solve errors and not just focusing on the most immediate. The time independent assessment was especially frustrating since I had done a similar piece of functionality for the little shop project that the timed independent consisted of. 

-----------------------

## D: Module Outcomes

(anything else you'd like to share about this module?)

Only that, everything I heard from upper mod students about their experience in module 2 was pretty accurate. In comparison to mod 1, it is easier in some areas, but also very difficult in different ways.
