# Katie Keel - M2 Portfolio

-----------------------

## A: Personal Growth

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to learn how to create basic Rails apps - and we did!

## Areas of Growth

ActiveRecord is still a struggle. I could stand to learn more about the underlying SQL as well.

On the bright side, I learned a lot about authorization/authentication and I feel very strong in those areas.
-----------------------

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Bike-Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/katiekeel/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

In this project we used Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.

I was the project manager on Bike Share. My goal was to learn how databases and web pages interacted.

Overall, I made sure all the odds and ends were taken care of, while others did the heavy lifting on the model methods. I wish I had had time to learn more about ActiveRecord. However, Bike Share was such a huge project that there just wasn't time to learn everything to the degree I wanted to learn it.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/katiekeel/activist)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

We used authentication and authorization to create a Rails app of our choosing.

My goal was to make an app that people might actually find useful someday. While it's still not really useable by the average person right now, I plan on continuing work on this app to actually deploy it someday.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/katiekeel/little-shop)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

In this project we used Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering.

I was project manager again on this project. My goal was to hammer down my skills in using Rails as a whole.

This project went extremely well. Despite team hiccups (that had nothing to do with interpersonal interaction), we finished this project in plenty of time and I'm pretty proud of it. The project barely required the use of ActiveRecord methods, something I would like to learn more about in Mod 3.
-----------------------

## C: Final Assessments

I felt that both of these assessments went extremely well. Although I did forget the syntax on some of the written exam questions, I feel that these assessments are an accurate reflection of my skills and understanding of Mod 2 concepts.

-----------------------

## D: Module Outcomes

Mod 2 was really fun, and also a nice breather between Mods 1 and 3. Thanks to Lauren, Rachel and Ol' Hickory Ham Mike for great instruction, as always.
