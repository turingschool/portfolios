## A: Personal Growth

## Areas of Emphasis

This module was not easier than mod 1, as most people implied. I struggled in ways that were very new and different.Ultimately, I think I've gained a better understanding for life in the tech industry after Turing -- the idea of picking up and utilizing new technologies on the go, being affected by and thriving in various group dynamics, and being able to overcome the feeling of failure.

Going into this module, my goal was to improve on skills learned in mod 1 and to not fall behind on new material. I also wanted to dedicate more time developing relationships in the Turing community.

## Areas of Growth

Working in larger groups provided a unique challenge but I am happy I was able to move forward and pass the negative interactions that could have propagated.

I've made a lot of progress in keeping myself on schedule and setting realistic boundaries. I've been able to time-box tasks better and got more sleep. I'd like to continue to develop skills to do this better, because as fatigue is starting to settle in, it's been more difficult to keep up with my newly learned good practices.  

I've been reading more code in general -- rereading and redoing some of my old work, looking at other code bases, and especially during the group projects, I've made a point to read and understand every line of code that is being committed. This has been tremendously powerful in picking up better coding practices. Furthermore, it forced me to consider writing and organizing code in ways that make it clear and readable. Seeing others make the same errors I have made and still would make, really helped me to be aware and to put in the extra time to do a better job.


## Evaluation Notes:

[From Bike-Share Major Takeaway] Lauren wanted the group use more active record instead of Ruby and we discussed UI, user stories, wireframing and app flow in general. While I felt good about the project as a whole, a lot of the issues we talked about during the review had not been previously discussed within the group and it was very helpful to pin-point those gaps.

[From Mid-Mod] Mike had to guide me through a lot of the examples; he felt I needed more time/practice with the new material and I felt the same. Working through the mid-mod assessment in class was very helpful and allowed me to prepare for the final assessment.

[From Rails-Mini] Lauren helped me to debug a few 'simple' problems I had created for myself during migrations -- I had mistakenly used 'resources' instead of 'references' during a join table migration and couldn't figure out some of the errors I was getting. I felt challenged by navigating a project on my own, but the feedback was positive and I look forward to building up WineFix (previously WineBox) in the coming mods.

## Community Involvement

Last mod, I felt very overwhelmed and couldn't participate in the community as much as I would have liked. I'm happy in the last two months, I've been able to offer help and pair with mod 1 students, I've present for the optional events (Friday talks), I attended an after school demo event, I am the co-lead for my posse group and I was able to spend a Saturday volunteering as a TA and panelist for a Try Turing event. I am proud that my posse met regularly, all groups members showed up, and we hosted a mentor during one of the meeting. I'm happy to be building relationships with students and staff and the Turing community is very important to me -- I strongly believe we have something amazing, and I'd like to share that with others as much as I can.  

-----------------------

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod the projects were completely different compared to last mod. Initially, I was worried because in the past I have not done well self-teaching and staying on track. During the first half of the mod, this remained a challenge, but I feel that I have started to develop a rhythm and to enjoy the sense of ownership that comes along with self-guidance. Ironically, this has made me more aware when someone helps, and I think it's pushed me to ask for help more and to ask better, more focused questions too. I think working in groups has been the greatest learning experience, and it pushed me to become really comfortable with Git / GitHub.

#### Bike-Share

* GitHub: https://github.com/DesTodo/bike-share
* Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share

For this project we setup an application utilizing a multivariable database to provide information about a bike share initiative -- its growth, accessibility and availability.

I was selected to be the project manager for my group. This pushed me to learn how to use Waffle and Git/Github in more detail.

Starting was challenging because the material felt unfamiliar (CRUD/Sinatra/Databases/Schema). Also, having the long weekend and no classtime added difficulty in organizing a group. However, we agreed to meet almost everyday and worked on most of the project together or in pairs. I think this slowed us down, but it was a great learning experience. Each team member expressed what they would like to improve on/learn more about initially, and the group tried to accommodate that as much as possible.

I was most comfortable with CRUD and I worked on those parts of the project initially, but in the later days we decided to switch responsibilities, and I was able to create a table, clean and seed the data, and worked on logic and views on the last day of the project. By the time it was due, I felt comfortable and I had good understanding of all the code that went into it.  

Personal Note: Over the long weekend, we spent at least 40 hours at Turing. I regret doing that because I felt completely exhausted and reluctant to spend more time in school when classes resumed. Since then, I've decided I need to not come in at least 1 weekend day and even if I need to work -- do it remotely from my house.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/DesTodo/wine_box
* [Original Assignment]http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project

I am building an app that allows users to look up wines and to create lists to track their selections and preferences. I'd like each user to receive unique identifiers for each wine on their list, and for business clients to be able to access that information at a retail location -- the goal is that no one should have to remember complicated wine label names -- instead, you can go to the store and pick up 'MyPinkLadyFave11'.

The biggest thing I gained is appreciation for red-green-refactor and the process of breaking large ideas into doable tasks; I continue to learn about the the process of wireframing, defining the UI, and accurately and continuously updating the schema. This project pushed me to reach out to other students and mentors and I received a lot of valuable advice and feedback by asking questions during the demo event.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/thedanielvogelsang/little_shop
* [Original Assignment] http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop

It is unfortunate the focus during this project has been on group dynamics, rather than doing our best work. At the same time, this is the first project when I feel comfortable and able to go home and build a feature independently.
-----------------------

## C: Final Assessments

I received positive comments and 3s and 4s. I am very happy with the outcome. This was the first 'high-stress' timed assessment that I was able to fully complete. To prepare for it, I reviewed all of my classnotes, job tracker, and the mid-mod. I felt that my hard work paid off.

I can see a great improvement since the mid-mod assessment. I feel comfortable creating/manipulating migrations and creating more appropriate object relationships is allowing me to be more comfortable utilizing active record methods and to learn new ones faster. I am happy with the progress I have made.  
-----------------------

## D: Module Outcomes

I am happy that despite poor group dynamics, I've been able to stay focused on learning and making the most of my Turing experience. I am grateful to have had not 2 but 3 great instructors to guide us though these new challenges.
