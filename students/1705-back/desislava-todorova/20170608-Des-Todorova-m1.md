Areas of Emphasis:

Coming into Turing I didn't know what to expect, but at every step I felt that this is exactly where I need to be and this is exactly what needs to be taking place; I really trusted the Turing process. I am happy to report that I feel confident walking into this review and also into Mod2. While it's been challenging and I've been on my own timeline, there is not an area or concept in Ruby that still feels fuzzy. The last two weeks have brought me exponential growth, and some rest and more practice will allow me to perform within the time required time constraints in future projects and assessments. Black Thursday was instrumental in getting practice in a lot of the Ruby fundamentals we learned; it required a ton of logic and information retention, but also a lot of repetition; completing this project increased my understanding and confidence in Ruby. I can actually TDD!! And I enjoy and value the process of writing tests!! This is something I found difficult for a period of time and it feels great to have moved on from this challenge. I feel this mod has been successful, even if difficult and at times, chaotic.

B: Individual Work & Projects

  Working on our first individual project, Credit Check, was shocking and rewarding. I remember spending that entire weekend at Turing with most of my classmates. It was daunting to find the confidence to come up with a solution, but actually getting the credit card numbers to checkout was a proud moment. I was able to take the project from red to green rather quickly, but learned that red_to_green != project_completed. White-boarding over the weekend was immensely helpful to see that there are truly more 'correct' solutions than one person can think of on their own. I also learned that reading someone else's code is a challenge.

  Next came Date Night. Starting on it was confusing. Going into it, I didn't understand why every person I reached out to would try and go over linked lists and binary trees again and again. I felt like I understood the concept already -- they are lists with pointers and branches. It wasn't until 3-4 days into the project, after painfully putting together pieces that mostly didn't feel right, that it started to click; I realized I most definitely did not get binary trees up until that point. What I was missing was the abstraction component and how a coding language, such as Ruby, can take abstract ideas like probability and order, and then use ORM to create and capture pieces of abstract thinking to create programming objects which in turn can become tools for building platforms for the expression of logical statements. This is when I had a glimpse into the power of OOP. Once I understood the practical relationship between the node and its branches, I couldn't stop white boarding traversive objects. The idea was brilliant! I couldn't believe the knowledge that had been bestowed upon me. At this point in time, I was spending all of my time plotting and writing code.

Code Review with Alli:
Notes:  
Quit and play work, play includes player ship placement and works through first fire  
Talked through classes, demonstrates a good understanding of OOP w/ objects  
Frequent long methods, opportunities to refactor with nested loops and if/else  

Rubric:
Fundamental Ruby & Style       => 2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs refactoring
Enumerable & Collections       => 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
Test-Driven Development        => 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
Git Workflow: FAIL
REPL Interface                 => 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use
Breaking Logic into Components => 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
Functional Expectations        => 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.

C: Group Work & Projects

Projects

My experience working with Eddie and then with Ellen was fantastic. It was challenging at times to navigate my own stress and tight schedule in the context of a project partner, but I think it certainly paid off. I've realized that knowing someone else's success is directly dependent on me is a great motivator. I've learned that we all change our minds about different things and revisiting expectations is critical. Naming variables is hard and trusting someone else's judgement is even harder.

D: Professional Skills

Gear Up

I am grateful all the instructional staff at Turing are doing their best to select materials well and to lead activities worth the time. Some of my classmates favor topics and events different from the ones I liked best -- this awareness brings me comfort that whatever we are doing, it is impactful to someone in the room, and therefore, it is worth my time and energy also.

Growth Mindset
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown

I loved that we had a GearUp session with Jeff during week one. He fascilitated meaningful conversations although most students were still complete strangers. I was reminded of how different our experience of the world can be and have been maintaining a sense of curiosity to know more about others since. I really liked that the mod 1 BE and FE groups were mixed -- it forced us out of our classrooms and to remember we are not going through this experience alone.

Getting Better at Difficult Things
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md

This week's GearUp was a success, because it made us all more aware of each other's experiences. I think the group became closer as a whole after we were introduced to some of the concept of cognitive resources and how that can impact emotional state and work progress too.

Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown

During this session, the thing that stood out the most was how much more we are all alike than different. I think every single person in my small group had a moment of: "You feel that way? You do things that way?? That's amazing!! Me too." Personally, I was surprised that the people in group who perceived themselves as introverts spoke out more often than the extroverts.

Personal Stories & Connection
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown

I loved this week's discussions as a whole. My favorite part was actually the student led spike session we had on this topic. The TedTalk that was selected to watch was very impactful, and it resonated with me.


Debugging the Gender Gap & Microaggressions in Tech
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md

This session was very comforting. After watching a rather difficult movie about gender disparity in the tech field, I was surprised by how willing and eager most of my classmates were to have tough conversations.

E: Community Participation

Playing a Part

During mod 1, I decided to focus on gaining understanding of Turing the community, and I used the little spare time I had to: 1. Create meaningful relationships with uppermodmen/women who seem have big present and inspire me by doing well at being students and exceptional people -- I asked questions and made meaningful conversations and learning about and from their experience at the school a priority; 2. I tried to meet as many of the Turing staff personally, to understand the who and how behind the curtains and also to make communication on different topics targeted and easier by going to the right person; 3. I decided to put my trust into and remained completely open about very personal matters with my instructors during a challenging time instead of disappearing; 4. I made brining positive energy to the classroom a priority and maintained awareness not to disturb the group dynamics when my schedule became hectic I made sure to check in with multiple classmates consistently but also with anyone who was around and willing to have a conversation and shared with a number of them the details of my personal struggles; 5. I adopted some of the advice we've been getting during GearUps and I've tried to keep myself responsible in being open to others -- say hello in the kitchen, make time for one meaningful question, care, learn, and most importantly -- hold space for what's right by speaking up on behalf of others when no one else will.

During upcoming mods, I want to participate in a posse, and also to give a Spike -- student led discussions have been the best learning experiences. I am grateful to be a part of such great group of people where we can safely try our best, fail at times, collectively celebrate the small wins, and always find appreciation and support. It is my goal to play a greater role at Turing in the upcoming mods. I will continue to emulate the values which make Turing what it is, and I see myself having a long-term relationship with the school and staff, long past graduation.
