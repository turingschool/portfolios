# Matt DesMarteau - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

To learn how to build a web application in Rails and to become familiar with routing and Rails conventions. Also to learn how to test web applications.  Knowing there was a lot of information presented in Module 2, I wanted to focus on staying organized and working efficiently to complete all assignments on time.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I completed many individual tutorials and projects that proved to be very useful for building database-backed web applications in Sinatra and Rails.

### Sinatra CRUD - Robot World

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MDes41/robot_world)

__Project__ I created a Sinatra app from scratch. This app is a directory of robots. A robot has a name, city, state, avatar, birthdate, date hired, and department. I programed the CRUD functionality for robots so that visitors can see all robots, see one specific robot, edit/update a robot, create a robot, and delete a robot.

### Mix Master

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MDes41/mix_master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

__Project__ I created an app to keep track of songs, artists, and playlists.  This tutorial reinforced my ability to create models with CRUD functionality and taught me skills necessary to create a functioning app in rails:

**Goals**
* deploy an app to Heroku
* write model tests using RSpec
* write feature tests using RSpec and Capybara
* use branches and commits to develop git workflow
* model one-to-many data relationships
* model many-to-many data relationships
* use factories to create objects to use in tests
* use partials and helpers to tidy up views
* model one-to-one data relationships
* use polymorphic associations to associate an object with one of several other models
* implement authentication using Twitter OAuth
* write controller and view specs

### Rails Mini Project - Gif Generator

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MDes41/gif_generator)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

__Project__ I created an app where users can "favorite" gifs. Admins can generate gifs by entering a one-word search term in field and then clicking "generate gif". Regular users are not able to create a new gif in the database. Gifs belong to a category (category is the original word that was searched for by the admin).  Categories can be created and destroyed by a logged-in admin user (regular logged in users cannot create or destroy categories)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Through group projects, we explored best practices in agile project management and collaboration.

### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JeanJoeris/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

__Project__ In this project we used Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to build a web traffic tracking and analysis tool.  RushHouh is an application that aggregates and analyzes visitor data from another website. A RushHour customer/client will embed JavaScript in their website that will gather and send their visitor data to our site. It is important to note that we will not be creating this JavaScript. Instead we will simulate the process of gathering and receiving data, which we will call a payload. Our job was to build an application that can accept the submission of these payloads, analyze the data submitted, and display it through a HTML interface..
