# Raphael Barbo - (M1) Portfolio

## Individual

## Mission Statement

My mission is to be able to bring positive changes to the community through the use of technology, and in the future empower less fortunate individuals.

### Areas of Emphasis

In mod 1, I have set my expectations to be able to understand the fundamental ruby syntax, solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller pieces, build softwares with the implementation of pseudocode, TDD, code application, and refactoring throughout the process as needed in order to improve
comprehensibility and cleanliness.

### End of Module Assessment

#### Jeff's Assessment

###### Notes:
* Great flow to your work with appropriate confidence
* Good job reading through / debugging errors
* Good workflow / typing / tools
* Like how you're using Pry to help understand what you're TRYING to do, not just debug
* Good understandings, just slow down 10%, especially on tests

###### Score:

* Ruby Syntax & API : 3  
Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

* Completion and Progress : 4  
Developer fully completes baseline assignment and one of the Challenge options.

* Testing : 3  
Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

* Workflow : 3  
Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

* Collaboration : 4  
Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

* Enumerable & Collections : 3  
 Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### Work

Throughout my time at module 1, I have been assigned a total of 5 projects. 4 individual projects (Robodoku, CompleteMe, ParaMorse, and Battleship) and 1 pairing projects (Black Thursday).

## Projects

### individual Projects

#### Robodoku

* https://github.com/rsbarbo/robodoku
* Assessed By: Project was not assessed.

The main goal of this project was to write a program capable of solving a Sudoku game without human input.

Notes: N/A

* Functional Expectations:  N/A

* Test-Driven Development:  N/A

* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components:  N/A

* Fundamental Ruby & Style:  N/A

* Enumerable & Collections:  N/A

#### CompleteMe

* https://github.com/rsbarbo/complete_me
* Assessed By: Mike Dao

The main goal of this project was to break a program into logic components, testing components isolation, applying enumerables techniques. Complete Me explores the idea of an auto-complete feature like in a cellphone by a simple textual autocomplete system. 

Notes:
* Spec harness passes in 3.45s
* No tests for node
* Needs better naming of tests
* Try to not use setup and extract things out of tests too much
* Dont use an instance variable to do a count, calculate it
* Looking for a separate trie to abstract out certain functions 
* Some long methods, some opportunities to refactor 
* Tests do use fixtures at time

* Functional Expectations : 3  
Application fulfills all base expectations

* Test-Driven Development : 2  
Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components : 3  
Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

* Fundamental Ruby & Style : 3  
Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

* Fundamental Ruby & Style : 3  
Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

#### ParaMorse

* https://github.com/rsbarbo/paramorse_redo
* Assessed By: Beth Sebian

The main goal of this project was to break a program into logic components, testing components isolation, applying enumerables techniques. Morse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment. The goal here was to build a system to generate Morse code from plain text and decode Morse to plain text.

Notes: N/A

* Overall Functionality : 3  
Application follows the complete spec and one extension

* Fundamental Ruby & Style : 3  
Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

* Test-Driven Development : 3  
Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

* Breaking Logic into Components : 3  
Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

#### Battleship

* https://github.com/rsbarbo/battleship
* Assessed By: Beth Sebian

The main goal of this project was to break a program into logic components, testing components isolation, applying enumerables techniques. Battleship is a worldwide famous board game, when the player decides to start a game, the computer player should place their ships. The baseline computer should simply use random placements, but stil obey project's constraints.

Notes:
* Nice REPL interface
* Play loop working
* Ship placement a little wonky (can place ships in invalid locations)
* Incorrect input will cause crash (edge case)
* Overall nice organization

* Fundamental Ruby & Style : 3  
Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

* Enumerable & Collections : 3.5  
Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

* Test-Driven Development : 3  
Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

* REPL Interface : 4  
Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations to improve the gameplay

* Breaking Logic into Components : 3  
Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

### Team Projects

#### Black Thursday

* https://github.com/rsbarbo/black_thursday
* Assessed By: Mike Dao

The main goal of this project was to give a better understand of how to handle data, and the importance for businesses. A business is only as smart as its data. The goal was to build a system able to load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerece business.

Notes: TBA

* Functional Expectations : 3  
Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

* Test-Driven Development : 3  
Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components : 3  
Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

* Fundamental Ruby & Style : 3  
Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

* Enumerable & Collections : 3  
Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

* Code Sanitation : 4  
Zero complaints

Pairing Feedback:
Raphael was such an amazing support through Black Thursday as well as the rest of Module 1. Academically he was able to coach me through difficult spots while still keeping our pace lively and productive. He never thought twice about breaking issues down into smaller steps and reminding me that I was capable of anything. He has a very logical and positive way of approaching coding. Raphael was an emotional support for me as well as this project was a challenge for me. He was able to calmly lead me down the path needed to contribute to our project.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Jesse Spevack - "Jesse has an amazing personality, and inspiring attitude towards people, work and growth. Seeing how far Jesse has come in only 5 weeks of coding, is nothing far from impressive. I see Jesse as a natural born leader, who is caring, and extremely considered to other people. His ability to overcome challenges, and see the positive in every situation has inspired many of us in our cohort, and I will forever be thankful for having such an amazing human being in our 1606 cohort. Thank you - Raphael Barbo"

Susi Irwin - "I worked with Susi during our Black Thursday project. I am astonished how much progress she has made in her technical skills in such a short period of time. Her ability to ask the right questions, and understand answers is nothing but amazing. Susi is definitely a quick learner, and I am overall pleased to have worked with her. One feedback I would like to give Susi is to remember to always slow down, read the error messages, and remember that the most important thing throughout the project is the learning curve (ideally always pointing towards the top). Thanks for being an amazing person, super dedicate, and for keeping me on my toes!" - Raphael Barbo"

### Being a Community Member

"Raphael has incredible interpersonal skills. He has a very clear read on group dynamics and also has the ability to put himself in other people's shoes. I witnessed him recognize that a fellow student was upset after a code review, which I was oblivious to, and then move to show empathy and offer encouragement. He also clearly has some significant coding skill. Most recently, he helped me arrive at an approach to the Black Thursday project where repositories build themselves. Itâ€™s a real gift to have a guy like Raphael in the cohort. - Jesse Spevack"

"Raphael has been a pleasure to work with, he brings such an infectious energy and liveliness to our cohort. He is always encouraging and complimentary, and has set a great example for those of us new to Turing. In pairings I have had with Rapha, he was able to break down problems into manageable partitions, explain his thought process expertly, and make sure I understood what was going on in the code. In doing these things, he has shown how valuable he will be when contributing to a team in a professional setting. He and I both have an interest in design, and as good as he is at the back-end discipline, and I am very excited to see what he is able to create as we move on to more front-end-focused applications. - Brian Heim"

"Raphael's enthusiasm and willingness to help with any problem set an amazing example for the rest of the cohort. Also, inheriting Raphael's code in Paramorse provided me with an epiphany as to what clean code should look like. I didn't work with Raphael much, but his positive energy helped me push through a lot of frusturation and doubt. - Brendan Dillon"

### Playing a Part

From the very beginning I have had the opportunity to be part of Turing community by being elected by Turing's staff to become a member of the Student Advisory Board representing 1605 cohort, and now 1606-BE. I absolutely loved the experience I have shared with all the members of SAB, and Allison. I believe Turing truly and sincerely cares about its students and have their best interest in mind. Being part of this amazing school and community is an honor, and I am looking forward to see what the future holds for Turing alumni, current students, and prospect students.
