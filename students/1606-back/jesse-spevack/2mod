# Jesse Spevack - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

At the end of Module 2, I want to be comfortable with all of the course material covered, including using user authentication, building web frameworks with Rails, being comfortable writing tests which cover all my bases for running servers, and any "extra" learning opportunities with JavaScript or other languages for html markup. I would also like to find 'my thing,' as per Jeff's advice in my Module 1 evaluation. This thing will be an extracurricular technology that will improve my marketability to potential employers.
