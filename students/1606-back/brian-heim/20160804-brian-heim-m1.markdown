# Brian Heim - (M1) Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I set out to develop a solid understanding of the Ruby language, not only the core concepts but also implementing code using good Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals. 

I also set out to build relationships while at Turing: friendships and good working relationships with my fellow cohort-members, a solid relationship with a mentor to help guide me through my time at Turing, and to network with instructors and those in upper mods to foster connections with those who can help me with day-to-day life and projects at Turing.

## Team

### Projects

This section highlights the paired projects that I worked on during Mod 1

#### -(Night Writer)-

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bheim6/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

#### Description
  
  "The idea of Night Writing was first developed for Napoleon's army so soldiers could communicate silently at night without light. The concept of night writing led to Louis Braille's development of his Braille tactile writing system.

  This project generates Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse."
  
#### Evaluation Comments

  * Converts in both directions
  
  * Does not truncate to 80 characters
  
  * 12 tests, not all pass
  
  * Lots of replication
  
  * Does not do capital letters

#### Evaluation Scores

#### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully
  
#### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
  
#### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.
  
#### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

#### Feedback to me

* "Working with Brian was fantastic.  We clicked very well in our abilities to tackle problems together, and Brian’s ideas and way of thinking were very clear throughout the entire project.  He was able to clearly express his ideas, which led to a more than solid collaboration between the two of us.   With any frustration or issues we ran into, we were able to hash them out in very clear and direct ways.  Working with Brian was great and I look forward to future pairings with him during our time at Turing." - Chase Dunagan

#### Feedback to me

*  "Working with Brian on Black Thursday was a great experience. I was amazed by his ability to communicate ideas clearly
  and keep our understanding of the project straight. Before working with Brian, I hadn't done much pairing, but we wound 
  up pairing about half of the time on this project. It went really well, thanks to Brian's friendly demeanor, strong 
  communication, and persistance. The only thing I would recommend that he work on is developing a more efficient workflow 
  and figuring out how to more quickly get code from his head on to the screen." -Brendan Dillon

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* "Chase was great to work with on nightwriter. He is a very strong pair-programmer and is very good at communicating his thought process and ideas. I felt like I could always speak my mind around him and he was quite open to discussion and compromise if we disagreed on specific tasks. Because of this, we never really “stalled” and were always able to make a collective decision and move forward." - Feedback given to Chase Dunagan

* "Caleb was very helpful during our Mod 1 / Mod 2 pairing sessions. He is great at “leading” you toward the solution and showing you how to use the tools (like ‘pry’) to get there, rather than just doing the work for you. His teaching style left me feeling confident in my own ability to solve the next iteration." - Feedback given to Caleb Cowen

* "Yoseph was the first person that I met outside of my cohort at Turing. On day one of the module he saw another mod 1 student and I working on some exercises and immediately walked over, introduced himself, and asked if we needed help. It struck a chord with me how naturally he did this, and gave me a preview of what the Turing community is all about. He continued to offer his help throughout the module, both in official pairing sessions and general work on projects and exercises in the Big Workspace. He even gave me a pep talk before my final assessment when I told him how nervous I was. Yoseph is a fantastic programmer and teacher: he challenges you to truly think about what you are trying to solve, and attempts to lead you to the proper course of action to solve that problem." - Feedback given to Yoseph Anderson

* "Kinan has been a wonderful peer to me during this module. He frequently asks to compare code and offers helpful suggestions for refactoring and overall project functionality and scope. Outside of the curriculum, he is a is great listener and conversationalist. We have engaged in meaningful conversations ranging in topic from adjusting to life at Turing to exercise and nutrition to philosophy about life in general. He especially helped me talk through my concerns about my mid-module assessment scores, and gave me a confidence boost that really helped me down the final stretch of the module." - Feedback given to Kinan Whyte

* "Brendan has been fantastic to work with on Black Thursday. I am still amazed by how quickly he is able to implement a solution that requires little to no refactoring at all. His grasp of object relationships and enumerables is a major strength. Not only is he able to code effectively, he gives clear explanations of his thought process and has taught me quite a bit throughout each iteration of the project. As someone who can see the big picture, but can sometimes get stuck on the details, I have greatly benefitted from having Brendan as a partner. My only advice for him would be to not be afraid to assert himself when he has an idea, more often than not, his instincts are on-point." - Feedback given to Brendan Dillon
 
* "Raphael has been a pleasure to work with, he brings such an infectious energy and liveliness to our cohort. He is always encouraging and complimentary, and has set a great example for those of us new to Turing. In pairings I have had with Rapha, he was able to break down problems into manageable partitions, explain his thought process expertly, and make sure I understood what was going on in the code. In doing these things, he has shown how valuable he will be when contributing to a team in a professional setting. He and I both have an interest in design, and as good as he is at the back-end discipline, and I am very excited to see what he is able to create as we move on to more front-end-focused applications." - Feedback given to Raphael Barbo

### Being a Community Member

* "Ever since the first day I met Brian, he has had a spirit about him where he is almost always happy. During the first project “Robodoku” he willingly and happily attacked it without knowing the proper way to which showed determination and willingness to learn. When showing him different ways to approach problems he was adapting and absorbing knowledge with a hunger that showed through his actions. I feel strongly that if he is given time to learn new concepts and ideas, he will evolve into an excellent programmer and has the communication skills to effectively communicate with a team." -Yoseph Anderson

* "Brian has been a huge help to me during module one as a support system through course content, projects, and general understanding of abstract concepts. During the times we were able to converse and connect over our Turing life experience at various points during the module, Brian's input served me well in ways that countered stress and aided overwhelm. His friendliness, conversational personality, and sharp eyes on the screen add exactly the type of value any team would hope to expect from a developer." - Kinan Whyte

### Playing a Part

  * I engaged in helping other students from 1606-b, especially with the Flashcards project. Upon receiving positive feedback for this, I decided to leave Miyamoto for Hopper posse so that I can offer help to the next generation of Mod 1 students. 
  
  * I spread the word about Turing to friends, family and former co-workers, one such co-worker has already expressed interest in joining! 
  
  * I am very active in the disc-golfers group and try to organize meet-ups at local courses and trips to new courses, also proposed the idea of "Turing Tags", an organized way to foster friendly competition between those in the group.
  
  * Started playing a part in cleaning up, washing, and putting away dishes in the Big Workspace
