# Ryan Workman - M3 Portfolio: Freaky API-Day

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I focused primarily on becoming good enough to hold my own on the job.  Up until now, I have never felt like a professional programmer, but after taking risks and pushing myself this module, I am now confident that I could walk into a company and begin adding value.

### Feedback To Me

#### From Brendan:
Your biggest strength is your ability to just start typing and get things on the project done. On a project that was so confusing and stop-and-go, your ability to keep powering through the project was invaluable. You do, however, have a tendency to fall into rabbit holes and keep going until you are frustrated. You are like the Jacques Cousteau of rabbits. I get the sense that rabbit hole exploration is an immutable part of your style, but I think that you could work on cutting an idea loose before you bring frustration into a group.

#### From Susi:
Ryan - we finally got to work together! You were a rockstar learning how to build our web server and successfully deploying Acquire-A-Hire to it. Your DevOps know-how is really great. Good job! One area of growth for you would be to work on your team collaboration skills. When our project got down to nuts and bolts a few days in, you made the decision to work remotely to be heads down. Although I see the value in remote heads down work, I think it is beneficial to hammer down in the same room as a team and have in person stand up meetings to get the task(s) done. I would challenge you to step our of the comfort zone of solo, silo work and really push that full team heads-together approach, especially in moments of high stress. When we all came back together we saw that we did really need each other even if it was just for high-fives and "good jobs!". The team found our flow and it was amazing. Your energy, your knowledge and your ingenuity in problem solving make you such an invaluable member to a team and ours truly benefitted from you in a multitude of ways.

#### From Jean:
You did an awesome job getting us deployed to production, including learning about the asset pipeline. You could work on how you cope with your frustration, as it can be difficult when you get frustrated at each roadblock. That said, you overcome the roadblocks fine.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#Vote Your Conscience
##Were you designing curriculum for a civics class, how would you describe the rights and responsibilities or a US citizen to their country and fellow citizens.
I would describe the rights and responsibilities of a US citizen as two separate pieces of the pie that we call democracy.  As a citizen, your rights are excplicitly spelled out as laws in US constitution.  These are things you are allowed to do as long as you are a US citizen without getting in trouble.  On the other hand, responsibilities are a bit of a grey area.  As far as US law is concerned, one is not forced to, or required by law to, perform these responsibilities, but it is in the country's best interest to perform them.  For example, a democracy is only successful if everyone, legally allowed to, participates.  This is the repsonsibility of citizens.  Furthermore, if citizens don't support and fight for the constitution, then what's the point of your rights.

##To Vote or Not to Vote
Participating in the electoral process is your civic duty and is the only way to keep a democracy pure.  While this statement is true, the United States of America is not technically a democracy.  On the presidential level, a candidate can only win the oval office if they win 270 ELECTORAL COLLEGE votes out of 538.  The key here is that the popular vote, which is the total number of votes, is specifically counted in the run for presidency.  This means that if one is living in a primarily liberal state and votes for the conservative candidate, they essentially threw their vote away.  The state counts a majority for the liberal candidate and gives all its electoral college votes to that candidate.  Thinking back to Elementary School civics classes, is this what we were taught when we learned about how democracies function?  This system, as messy as it is nowadays, however, made logical sense when it was put in place.  Back in the day, accuracy was considered a problem.  Lacking sufficient technology, other generations could not create a pure democratic system.  These days, we have the technology to get closer to the purest sense of democracy.  In a world where there are millions upon millions of stock transactions recorded every day, there is no logical argument for the electoral college system.  Corrupt politicians and the big businesses backing them however will never allow the system to change.  When the system has successfully separated the people from the governing bodies, why would the governing body change the system.  So my question now is... is participating in the US voting system considered voting in a democracy, and is participating in its scoped structure considered a civic duty?

#Introversion

##Have you ever been in a team setting where the differences between introverted and extroverted working styles was clear. What were the benefits and challenges of the styles?
In the television news field, introverts were much better at creating shows and writing than extroverts.  Being an extrovert, I was constantly being repremanded for being "too loud" and "talking too much."  While these criticisms are fair, I personally work a whole lot better talking to others and speaking out my thoughts.

##How do you perceive the strengths and weaknesses of introverts? How do you perceive the strengths and weaknesses of extroverts?
I believe introverts are very strong workers and get a great deal of stuff accomplished.  They play a necessary role in any great group of workers.  However, as an extrovert it sometimes feels like pulling teeth trying to get them to share their thoughts and opinions.  This can hurt a group.  I believe that everyone needs to be open and honest about where we're headed and the goals we are all striving to accomplish.

##How can you leverage the strengths of introverts and extroverts in your future projects and future career?
That's a great question, and something that I have been struggling with for awhile now.  As with every DTR in Turing, I always say that I want everyone to be open and honest with me.  That means sharing your thoughts and feelings before we dig ourselves into hole.

# Resillience

## Reaction to first article
When I read the first article, I thought it was interesting that i considered resillience more of a learned skill and less than a character trait.  I have always thought of resllience as more of a something that you were born with. You either have resillience or you don't.  The New Yorker article challenged these ideas, saying that resillience is learned over time, going through tough experiences and overcoming obstacles.

## Reaction to second article
The second article made a lot more sense to me.  It said that being resillient is less about learning to overcome obstacles and more about the thought-process one has while dealing with tough situations.  One of the most challenging moments of my life was when I was working the graveyard shift for a news station in Portland, OR.  I have never been more depressed and down in my life.  Despite the overwhelming dark cloud hanging over my head, I kept reminding myself that without working at that station, I would never be able to get a job in Denver and be back around my family.  My thought of the hellish situation changed my outlook and helped me push through the two worst years of my life.

## The value of personal resillience
Personal resillience makes a huge impact on one's life.  Some of the greatest moments and achievements come following the face of great obstacles.  Without resillience, one would never power through the challenges and create greatness.

### (Personal Project Pitch)

#### New-Z
#### Pitch

Connecting the community with their local news stations to create a better product and more informed public.

#### Problem

Local news stations have forgotten about those they serve and thus are creating inferior products.  News producers often come from around the country and do not have the best understanding of the demands of community.

#### Solution

Bridge the communication gap between viewers and producers.  Instead of news producers choosing stories based on what THEY think their audience wants to hear, open up a line of dialogue and create a two-way conversation.  Technology now enables us to give and receive feedback, and that feedback can help producers curate the best content for the community they serve.

#### Target Audience

The app is intended to be used by local news producers and viewers.  Initially, any producer and any viewer can sign up for the app, but as it gains traction, news stations will be required to subscribe to the service, allowing its producers to access the site.  Viewers can then subscribe to the active news stations in their area.

#### Integrations (Back End Only)

* Which APIs will you use?
  * Twitter for authentication
  * CNN for news story generation
* Which OAuth integration are you planning to use?
  * Twitter



## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### To Susi:
This is my third consecutive module giving feedback to Susi, but it's the first time I have given her feedback after working with her. Overall, Susi is a solid programmer. Her eye for design and CSS abilities is absolutely inspiring. She has a solid grasp of Object-Oriented concepts and is able to solve problems. Susi has a tendency to allow what I call the "monster under the bed" to cripple her abilities. A simple road-bump in a problem can stop Susi in her tracks, and grows like a cancer inside her mind before consuming her emotionally. Saying all of this, I KNOW that Susi can solve these problems and be a great asset on any team, but she will have to learn how to tame the beast in her mind in order to excel.

#### To Jean:
Jean is one of the most talented people I have ever run into in my professional life. His ability to grasp a concept and understand its function and the logic behind it is uncanny. Specific to this group, Jean stepped up during some difficult emotional hurdles and steered us back onto the path of success. While Jean's ability to grasp technical concepts is incredible, his knowledge can be overwhelming at times. I consider myself a rather confident programmer, and, for me, pairing with him became intimidating at times. Now, I'm not saying he is purposely flaunting his knowledge or intentionally drowning out other voices, I just think his excitement for the problem gets the best of him. My advice is to reign back and focus that excitement. There are times that his excitement is great in context, but the self-awareness for those times and places is not fully-developed. When Jean learns how to convert all of his positive energy towards the group, his skills will know no bounds.

#### To Brendan:
In the most professional sense possible, Brendan is the most chill group member I have ever had the pleasure to work with. In this project, he was the perfect counter-balance to the energetic natures of Jean and I. His ability to maintain his cool, even in the most difficult problems is absolutely awe-inspiring. As for his technical skill, Brendan has an ability to interpret and write some of the most incredible and simple code I have ever seen. There have been many times that I would spit out some chunky mess, and together we turn it into gold. If I have to pick out a criticism, Brendan is a bit introverted, and as we learned during gear up, introverts get swallowed up in our culture. However, I would take that with a grain of salt, because, like I said above, your ability to assess the situation and speak up at the right times is great. Brendan is a great asset for any team, and I would love to have the opportunity to work with him again in the future.

### Being a Community Member

#### From Gabi:
As the leader of Miyamoto for this module, you have done a kick-ass job of reshaping our posse. I felt that we had very high-quality Friday spike sessions as well as Monday posse meetings. You also took to  hitting the books and digging into C # so that we could continue working on our game. I don't know when you sleep, but thank you for revamping our posse and keeping it alive!

### Playing a Part

#### Leader of Miyamoto Posse:
For the past six weeks, I have been leading the Miyamoto posse.  Since taking over the reigns, I have expanded the scope of the posse offering some of the most popular Friday Spike sessions of the module.  I organized Kathleen Dollard to speak to a group of over 40 students.  I also arranged a Friday Spike to work with Raspberry Pis and get a better grip on the hardware side of designing.

#### SAB Representative:
I'm wrapping up my second module as a representative on SAB.  Over the course of the last 3 months, I have helped communicate my cohorts concerns and ideas to Turing staff.  I also helped transition Susi into the SAB role and know that she will do a fabulous job as we all move forward into Module 4.
