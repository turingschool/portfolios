### Areas of Emphasis

I knew that Mod 1 would be challenging but I never expected to struggle as much as I did.  While I initially had some success it was immediately followed by frustration and setbacks.  This cycle was constantly repeated and it became apparent that I needed to repeat after the mid Mod assessment. I feel that the added study time I will have before repeating Mod 1 will allow for a better understanding of Ruby and will allow a more sold foundation to build on for the remainder of my time at Turing.

### End of Module Assessment

Since I am repeating Mod 1 I did not do the end of Module Assessment.

### Work

A brief summary of my reviewed work during Mod 1.

#### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michael-hill/flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

The goal of this project was to write a flashcard program that is used through the command line.

Notes:

*  Looking at Flashcards

*  Tests pass, but need more definition of the edge cases and small details

*  Implementation looks good with some small areas for simplification

  1. Functional Expectations

    3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

  2. Test-Driven Development

    3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

  3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

    3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

  4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

    3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

  5. Enumerable & Collections

    3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

#### Chisel

This project converts Markdown to HTML.



## Team

### Projects

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/calaway/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)


In this project we'll implement systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse.

Notes:

*  reads and writes

*  does 160 characters

*  does capitaliation and numbers

*  16 tests total

*  has a readme


1. Overall Functionality

  3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension
2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

  3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
3. Test-Driven Development

  3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.
4. Breaking Logic into Components

  3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

Feedback -

Mike was a great partner on the Nightwriter project.  He had a great attitude throughout, even when he struggled with some of the concepts that the project required.  He made sure that he had a good grasp on what we were working on, which was very helpful because it made sure all team members had a solid grip on what was going on and could explain how and why things were being done a certain way. - Dan Broadbent

Michael was a pleasure to work with on our Nightwriter project. He is an excellent communicator, which was immediately apparent in our original DTR session. He was very forthcoming when speaking to his current proficiencies, areas that he hoped to improve, and communication/feedback styles and preferences, which later helped us successfully navigate through a very challenging project. Even in the times when he did not yet have a complete comprehension of the material, he contributed greatly by asking many questions that would often lead us down a path to the correct solution, or allow us to expound on the concepts, ultimately leading to a better understanding on all sides. He was very flexible on work times. He took all feedback well and was lavish with compliments and praise. I hope to get the chance to work with him again in the future. - Calaway



## Community

### Giving Feedback

Ben has been a great friend throughout Mod 1.  He is always available to answer questions, look over my work or simply discuss my struggles as the Mod has progressed.  When I decided to repeat Mod 1, Ben provided insight into how to prepare in order to have success

I'm not sure I can say enough positive things about Yoseph.  He is always checking in before class to see if anyone needs help.  His patience and willingness to stay late (hours) to review code, answer questions or help others who are struggling is rare.  He is a true asset to the Turing community.

Susi has been the ultimate classmate and friend during Mod 1.  Her positive attitude and willingness to review concepts, look over code or simply be a friend and listen exemplifies the qualities that Turing teaches.

### Being a Community Member

Mike has been such a rock for me this Module. I have leaned on him for emotional, academic, and mental support more times that one would imagine. He is one the most genuine, empathetic individuals I have ever had the honor to meet. He is a hard worker, super devoted, and absolutely dedicated. I am proud to be his Turing-mate - Susi Irwin

### Playing a Part

It feels that my time during Mod 1 has been spent trying to keep my head above water. Outside of twice weekly pairing sessions, mentor sessions and posse sessions (go Hopper!) I unfortunately did not have much time for anything else.
