-  Use the Geolocation API to determine the weather in your current city
-  Save “pinned” or favorite cities to display their extended weather forecasts

##### Feedback to Me

**From Matt Kaufman:**
Dale is one of the most enjoyable team members I've ever worked with. He's always in high spirits, ready and able to always work hard to get the best results possible. Coming from an organizational background, his drive to help manage the team's tasks and keep us on track was a huge benefit. I personally struggle with staying organized, but with Dale's direction I felt like I could let go of the reigns and focus on the task at hand. He asks great questions, and has insight into the whole scope of the project that is very impressive. Working with Dale is pleasent, as he's always on time and on schedule...an incredibly reliable teammate. I love working with Dale and I think he's an extremely valuable teammate in all respects.

**From Hilary Lewis:**
  Through this project, I appreciate that Dale encouraged the team to take a good
  amount of time at the beginning of the project to organize, set up waffle, and
  communicate how we were going to execute our project. Although Dale's workflow
  was slower than usual, I admire Dale's determination to learn Vim during this
  project. Dale had a lot of good ideas on how to set up components and reducers.
  Overall, Dale has a lot to offer a team in terms of effective troubleshooting,
    teamwork, organization, and effective communication.

**From Chelsea Skovgaard:**
  For our Weather Forecast application, we did the majority of the application
  together as a four person team. From this perspective, I think Hilary, Dale,
  and Matt did a great job working as a team ensuring that everyone had a chance
  to give input and to drive the project. Dale did a good job of trying to help
  step back and reflect at different stages of the project about next steps. One
  area of improvement could be taking more ownership/trying to work solo on the
  skills he may find challenging. I also really appreciated Dale's
  reflective/thoughtful approach when discussing strengths with him during our
  strengths finder exercise this module - he helped me better articulate and
  express my strengths.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions

[Microaggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group2.md)

I appreciated learning more about the topic.  A realization is that micro aggression seem to occur in somewhat "transactional" or "informal encounters".  One of the most valuable take aways was from one of the group reporting out was not to confront the aggressor but to positively engage the assailed.

#### Journey Mapping

[Journey Mapping](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

The strength of the session was during the introduction about how it fit into the overall mission of Turing.  More reminders like this would be a welcome.  Students need to be aware that they signed a contract with the explicit and implicit that they agree and support the mission of the organization.  The exercise it self was not a valuable as I hoped though I was able learn more about my fellow students in the process.

#### Grit

[Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

I was not present for this Gear Up session. However, I have read *Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance* by Angela Duckworth and the closely related books *Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise* by Anders Ericsson and *Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business* by Charles Duhigg. I am compfortable with the concepts and find them intriguing.
