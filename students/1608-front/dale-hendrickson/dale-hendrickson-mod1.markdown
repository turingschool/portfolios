# Dale Hendrickson - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My primary goals for Module 1 of the Front-End program at Turing were quite simply to adapt to the organizational environment and to build positive relationships with my cohort. I felt that I needed to set the stage knowing the Module 1 will likely be the easiest from a technical stand point and having the right foundation to successfully complete the program was critical.  I think I have made some progress in that area but need to make some adjustments to get the balance right, perhaps ending the day earlier and starting earlier.

I believe that I have begun to build some positive relationships with the cohort.  I view their success as important as mine and I will continue to offer the assistance and support needed from my knowledge of the terminal, git, analysis, and planning.  I also hope that I can continue to bring a positive perspective based on my life and professional experience while also being open learning from those in my group.

Going forward my biggest challenge will be the competence in the syntax of the languages and frameworks that we are learning and working with.  This has always been difficult for me.  A possible approach would be to get my pairs to spend more time upfront on analysis and design then have me spend more time at the keyboard in during pairing sessions.  Also, my comprehension of object oriented constructs is still tenuous and I am unsure of how to improve in that area.

* [Code Base](https://github.com/dshendrickson/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser is a web based game that presents a person with an input form to enter guess integer to match a random number generated between a range of numbers defined by the game.  To win the game, the person's enter guess matches the random generated vale.

##### Evaluation Comments

Excellent effort to refactor code. Love that you pulled out methods and conditionals to separate functions. I think there is room for refactoring. Some smelly long functions.

##### Scores (0 to 4)
Functional Expectations: 4 -Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

##### Feedback from Mike Ziccardi  
Dale was my partner on our very first project. I was having a hard time wrapping my head around javascript and Dale helped me to get a better grasp. He would always help explain things when I had questions, and was always happy to repeat himself. For our first project I was happy to be paired with Dale. He’s the Git master and is always happy to help when anybody has questions.

#### Linked List

* [Linked List](https://dshendrickson.github.io/linked-list/)
* [Code Base](https://github.com/dshendrickson/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked list is a web based application that allows a person to enter a web url and associated title. Once submitted all the titles and links appear on the page and the person can then mark them read and/or remove them.  A global button to remove all links marked read is also available.

##### Scores (0 to 4)
Functional Expectations: 4 - Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
HTML Style: 4 - Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.
CSS Style: 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
Fundamental JavaScript Style: 3 - Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
Workflow: 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

##### Feedback from Devin Beliveau
I was really excited to work with Dale because he knows so much about git and github (which I was struggling with at the time) and it was really helpful to spend the first forty-five minutes just going through the workflow and setting up the project correctly. It’s clear Dale really takes the time to think about how to break large pieces of projects into smaller parts and he made sure we understood why we were writing every line of code we did. Overall the linked-list was one of my favorite projects and I think it was because our workflow was so great.

#### IdeaBox

* [IdeaBox](http://ianlancaster.github.io/idea-box/)
* [Code Base](https://github.com/dshendrickson/ideabox/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

IdeaBox is a web based application that allows a person to capture ideas by entering and saving them in a web page.  The person can then change the quality of the idea.  The idea can also be deleted from the IdeaBox.

##### Scores

Specification Adherence: 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface: 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

JavaScript Style: 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow: 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

##### Feedback from Ian Lancaster
Dale was a pleasure to work with Dale for the Idea Box project. He had great insights as we worked on the project and was very receptive to me coaching him through parts of the code that we were having trouble with. We worked in an effective and collaborative manner for most of the project, but also effectively divided and conquered features toward the end.

#### Game Time 2048

[2048](https://rcwestlake.github.io/2048/)
[Code Base](https://github.com/dshendrickson/2048)
[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

2048 is a web based game based on factors of two with the objective to combine adjacent tiles/cells to obtain higher valued ones. The player can choose to move up, down, left, or right using the arrow keys on a standard keyboard. The play stops when there are no open tiles/cells on the game board and no adjacent tiles/cells that can be combined.

##### Scores

JavaScript Style: 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow: 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
Code Sanitation: 3 - Five or fewer complaints

##### Feedback from Ryan Westlake
We had the pleasure of having Dale join our team mid-way through the project. He was able to quickly get comfortable with the layout of our code and our progress in the project. While it can be difficult to not have the benefit of context, Dale did an amazing job of being a valuable contributor right away. He has an analytical mind, which was helpful as we worked through several bugs. I hope I have the pleasure of working with Dale again, and trust he will be very successful in the program and with whatever company is blessed to hire him.

##### Feedback from Christine Gamble
Dale joined Ryan and I on Gametime, and I am really glad he did! Ryan and I worked closely with Dale before he officially joined the team since we were doing the same game. I was incredibly impressed with how thorough Dale thought out the approach.  His attention to detail made a great difference in how we wrote our code. When he joined our team he was able to jump right into our code, and did some great work, especially with finding bugs and refactoring.  I look forward to working more with him.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Devin Beliveau on Linked List
Devin and I worked on the Linked List project.  I found Devin to be creative and easy to work with. We quickly established a great balance of pair and independent work time. Due to this we were able to bring things together effectively and learn from each other.  She was thoughtful about the approaches to the work and we were always able to talk constructively through challenges.  I look forward to working with her again.

#### Christine Gamble on Game Time 2048
Christine was on the Game Time project with Ryan and me.  She was a pleasure to work with and, as a team, worked really well together.  We received very positive feedback during the code review on the tests that were developed for the project.  Christine was lead for testing on the project and guided us to success.  I look forward to working with her in the future.


#### Ian Lancaster on IdeaBox
Ian and I worked on the IdeaBox project.  He was a couple of steps ahead of me on JavaScript skills but took the time to walk me though and explain the where and why he was moving in a particular direction.  We had a great balance of pair and independent work time and were able to bring together our work effectively. Ian was a solid pair and I look forward to working with him through our time at Turing.

#### Ryan Westlake on Game Time 2048
Ryan, Christine, and I worked the GameTime project. I was late joining the team but he was supportive and helpful in allowing me to catchup to the work that had already done.  He has strong leadership skills with a good self-awareness of where he wants to improve. We were able to establish a great balance of joint and independent work that kept the project moving forward without anyone getting left behind.  Ryan was a great listener as well as being good about talking through technical challenges. I really look forward to working with him through our time a turing.      

#### Mike Ziccardi on Number Guesser
I worked with Mike on Number Guesser, the first project for 1608-FE.  We worked effectively together and did most of the work in joint pairing.  I came to the project with more knowledge of the command-line and git and Mike was eager to learn those tools.  Though he often said he, "wasn’t getting it,” he kept working hard and understated what he was learning. I liked working with Mike and the work we accomplished.

### Being a Community Member

#### Alex Pilewski
Dale has been a wonderful, wonderful member of the cohort. He is extremely gracious with his time and has helped countless members of our group with git issues time and again. It is easy to notice his excellent work temperament that helps make problem solving and collaboration frictionless. I would be delighted to be paired with Dale on any project.

### Playing a Part

* Attended React JS meetup.
* Shared git and terminal skills with my cohort as well as with the 1606.
* Offered back channel checkins and support to members of my cohort.
* Regularly met with my mentor.
* Linked Meg Stewart and Turing.
