* **D: Professional Skills**: 2.5 (didn't do networking or meetups like I wanted)
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 2.5 (projects on weekends didn't allow my to participate in events I wanted to)

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I was assessed by Taylor (tay-tay, aka black bear). 

My biggest takeaway is to slow down. I have a tendency to rush ahead, especially in group projects, which hurts those I am working with who may be behind as well as doesn't give me the ability to learn how to better communicate my thoughts and code. 

**Progression/Completion**

3.5: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

**JavaScript Style**

3.5: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

**Workflow**

4: Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development

**Collaboration**

4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

Evaluated by: Jhun

**Comments**

- move logic out of index.js
- some opportunities to refactor using closures || partial functions. 
- Some repeated code
- sass is great
- great ui
- app is accessible!


**Evaluation Scores**

*Specification Adherence*

3.5 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

*Accessibility*

4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.

*User Interface*

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

*HTML Style*

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

*CSS/Sass Style*

4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

*JavaScript Style*

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

*Testing*

3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

*Workflow*

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

*Code Sanitation*

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints

*Feedback to Me on Project*

From Mike Ziccardi: ```I really enjoyed working with Ryan. His Can-do attitude was super helpful when running into small speed bumps during our time working on 2dobox. He helped me when I was struggling with concepts and he always kept me positive. One thing that I feel would be beneficial to Ryan is to take more breaks. for me the long stretches of coding would cause me to have worse focus and not get much progress. Ryan has really been killing it lately and i’m happy to be in class with him```


#### Shoot-the-Breeze

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rcwestlake/chatterbox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html)

This is a desktop messaging application. Build in React and used Firebase. 
Evaluated by: Meeka

*Evaluation Comments*

Differences Between Spec and Product

- No ability to travel below the fold to see new messages if we have too many
- Submit is disabled when the message is over 140 characters
- Changed name of app
- Text for the sort buttons changed, no icons displayed
- Abbreviated month
- Red button beside user is different style than spec
- Submit button text is different
- MV: Still displaying the name of the map
- Dates shoud be displayed as numerals in mobile view
- Message input and char count should be above submit and clear
- MV: Shouldn't show users in mobile view
- Added a feature and visual change with a button to clear the user sort
- When logged out, you should see messages but not see the input field

*Evaluation Scores*

*Specification Adherence*

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

*Component Architecture*

4 - Application is broken out into small reusable React components. Complicated functionality is wrapped in parent components. There are zero cases where a complicated component can be broken down into smaller composite components.

*User Interface*

2.5 - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.

*CSS/Sass Style*

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

*JavaScript Style*

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

*Testing*

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application using Enzyme. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application (aside from logging in).
Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

*Code Sanitation*

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

3 - Five or fewer complaints

*Design*

3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

*Feedback to Me from Ian Lancaster*

```I had a great experience working with Ryan on Chatterbox. I really appreciated working with a partner with a solid understanding of the technologies used and a desire to excel. I appreciated his diplomacy, ability to articulate his reasoning, and ability to compromise. I was also impressed by the excellent git workflow that he enforced. We worked effectively together and dividing and conquering. Like myself, Ryan seemed to want to do thing the right/best way rather than the easy way. One thing I would advise Ryan look out for in the future is taking on too much in attempt to lean new technologies, excel, and do things the best way.```


#### Fire-Bae (PennyWise)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rcwestlake/BudgetApp)

**Feedback from Partners**

Gabi: ```Ryan demonstrated some excellent teamwork and leadership skills during our time spent on Firebae. He took initiative and lead the project by suggesting that we be bold and implement our project using React Native. Ryan demonstrated experience with project management by checking in with his team members, making sure that everyone understood the current direction of the project/code, timeboxing areas that we were experiencing difficulty with, and guiding the flow of the project. An area that Ryan may benefit from may be delegating more tasks in the future. This may have been difficult to do with this particular project, as we were all new to learning this particular framework. Thank you Ryan for all of your hard work!```

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Resilience 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

My notes from workshop: 

* When you first read the title of this GearUp, what were your initial reactions? What experiences have you had that shaped your attitude toward the topic?
* What did you learn from reading the article? Did this change or affirm any attitudes and beliefs you hold?
* What value do you put on personal resilience? Why?
* Consider Josh Spodek's premise that knowing about resilience is different than becoming more resilient. Identify 3 mental practices and behaviors that constitute resilience skills.



1. This is an important topic. I can learn from this. I have a lot of room for growth in this area. It is definitely applicable to coding, as your entire day is spent working through technical problems. 
2. Resilience is not affected by events, it is your response to those events. Your perspective or view plays an essential role in whether you will be resilient or not. “they believed that they, and not their circumstances, affected their achievements.“
3. Huge value. Any worth doing will be difficult, which naturally will require resilience. Great companies were built because the founders chose to be resilient. Wars were won because the soldiers and leaders chose to be resilient. 
4. Three behaviors: 
    1. One of the central elements of resilience, Bonanno has found, is perception: Do you conceptualize an event as traumatic, or as an opportunity to learn and grow? 
    2. Look for the greater good and meaning in the events. “I know this happened, but how can I rise above this?
    3. Don’t allow other people’s lack of resilience influence your sense or purpose or pushing forward. 

    
#### Voting

My Notes: 

First, being a citizen is an honor and privilege. By being a citizen or member of the United States, every person is given rights and responsibilities. It is their duty to fulfill those responsibilities and protect and preserve the rights passed down since the founding of the country. 

It is the proper balance of rights and responsibilities that leads to a strong nation. Too many rights and no responsibility would lead to a nation which fails in action, leading to rights being diminished. Too many responsibilities and no rights will lead to a 

If designing a curriculum I would cover each right and responsibility and draw the connection between them, going into more depth on the ‘why’ or importance of each one. 

My hope would be to help each student to see the importance they play in the county’s success, as each citizen or member plays a critical role. 

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

I enjoyed the video, no notes. 
    


### Professional Development Workshops
##### Top 10 Companies - https://trello.com/b/NMw6t9ga/ryan-westlake-companies

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

I gave positive and constructive feedback to several people in the class. 

### Being a Community Member

I have room for improvement in this area. In a smaller way, while it seems that I disagree with most people politically at Turing, I did not voice my opinions to preserve relationships and didn't take offense at some of the things said (they didn't realize there were those who held contrary views to most of Turing).  

### Playing a Part

I was involved every Friday. I threw in my hat for SAB next module.
