### Feedback to Me

* Michael Dorrance: Not only does Alex bring project management experience to the team but also excellent knowledge of Ruby and Sinatra.
  As part of our Traffic Spy team, Alex has a tenacity for experimentation which kept any roadblocks to a minimum.
  He is a strong programmer who is considerate, professional and committed to success. He is open to new ideas and embraces other's approaches to tackling challenges.
  I would work again on any project with Alex.

* Kristina Brown: Alex! You've been great with our posse, stay strong, posse stuff gets harder as you go along but it's really important for the young ones, just keep doing what you're doing.


## Community

* I try to help whenever I can with coding problems, especially with 1505. I would like to be more involved in Community Outreach next module.

### Giving Feedback

* Gave feedback to all members of TrafficSpy group
* Gave feedback to all members of Endangerous Outfitters group

### Playing a Part

* On Friday, July 17, I delivered a lightning talk "Bolide Detection Systems"
