I# Michael Dorrance - Module 2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

One of my goals for Module 2 was to get better at breaking down problems into small manageble chunks. Starting with Traffic Spy, I focused on using tools that I used in the past of client work both in technology and construction, visual blueprints. So as a group we developed our user stories about what we were going to accomplish. I then used Balsamiq to create wireframes to verify with the group that we were all on the same page as far as url structure and content to be displayed. The interactive wireframes were a successful tool for our group to validate how the words we were reading would be transferred to the web.

I then asked the group if it was ok for me to build the html structure for each page using Bootstrap and they agreed. The ability to visually see placeholders for each piece of functionality was key to a very smooth and successful team project driven by TDD/BDD. We developed a plan and could see visually what the next step would be. An added benefit was that it was more fun to write the code when it looked good on the web. Our project workflow was smooth, fun and enjoyable.

### End of Module Assessment

Notes: Mike seems to understand the key concepts expected in M2. He was nervous and some of the code written at the beginning of the assessment indicate that while he understands what's going on, the knowledge isn't as deep as it could be. This is likely resolved with more practice with Ruby and Rails. Classes at the beginning of M2 would probably prevent him from focusing on Rails as much as he should. Of all the modules at Turing, M3 is the one that he would benefit from most. If repeating is something that should happen, I think it would be best at M3. I would suggest pairing with mentors or non-peers to help feel more comfortable in situations where he would feel nervous. This will also have the added benefit of preparing for interviews. Practice Ruby enumerables by working through exercises similar to Technical Interview Prep.

### Projects

Team project were a great experience in Module 2

#### Traffic Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imwithsam/traffic-spy)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/5cd41b3635cc4d32431032d42bcfc9f7da3135d5/source/projects/traffic_spy.markdown)

In this project we used Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to build a web traffic tracking and analysis tool.

Our application will be live on the Internet. It can recieve data over HTTP from a simulation engine. The simulator will construct and transmit HTTP requests which include tracking data.

Imagine that I run a commercial website and embed JavaScript code which gets activated each time a page is viewed on my site. That JavaScript captures information about the visitor and the page they're viewing then, in the background, submits that data to your TrafficSpy application.

Our application parses and stores that data.

Later, I visit your site and can view data about my traffic through a HTML interface.

"Mike is an outstanding teammate with strong programming skills. Our Traffic Spy project was successful largely due to the extra work that Mike put in (often after hours). If it wasn't for Mike's mockup and wireframe skills, our grade might have been a full point lower. His demeanor is always pleasant and supportive. Our cohort is much stronger because Mike is in it." - Adam Caron

“Mike was easy to work with on both Traffic Spy and Little Shop of Orders. He is very personable, an all-too-often rare trait among programmers. He may not be the strongest test taker, but he demonstrates a strong grasp of Ruby and Rails in his daily work. He has taught multiple student-led sessions on front-end design, and his passion for front-end development is a welcome asset. Mike is a hard worker, and is usually one of the first persons in and last persons out of the classroom each day." - Sam Brock

"Mike was an extremely valuable member of our Traffic Spy team, he was positive, thoughtful and driven throughout the project. He has a great skill of preparing visuals and mockups to build our vision before actually creating it. He has a great passion for development and his enthusiasm to solve problems spreads to all team members. I look forward to working with Mike again!" - Alex Tideman

#### Little Shop of Orders aka "Redrum Nursery"

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michael-reeves/redrum_nursery)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

In 10 days our team was able to build a functional e-commerce website using agile processes. Our team worked well together and we were able to integrate Stripe payments but also Twilio text messaging and phone calls through the computer.

" I could not be prouder of the team I had for Redrum Nursery.  Mike really gave the team good direction for the visual style of the site and it would not have looked nearly as good as it did without him.  But not only that, he wanted to tackle other pieces of Rails, so he and Sam Brock did a great job of pulling the user authentication and authorization processes together.  Mike worked very hard on this project, and I can’t thank him enough." - Mike Reeves

"I had a great time working with Michael Dorrance on the “The Little Shop of Orders” project! I learned a ton from him during the project. From UX and CSS, to dedication and how to work hard. He was a great contributor to our project and I would enjoy working with him again in the future." - Sebastian Abondano

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I provided feedback on every weekly survey.

### Playing a Part

I helped Lovisa with the 1507 Intro Class for 2 hours on the Thursday before the module started and then proceeded to meet them at the happy hour that day.

Fellow classmates from my module wanted to learn how to do wireframing and use Balsamiq for their projects after seeing the way they helped our Traffic Spy group with project management and design, so I led a student session on Friday July 24 titled:
* Breaking down problems with wireframes (Student-led session, 2-4pm)
  - Gain an understanding of the REAL user stories
  - Introduce wireframing tools and techniques
  - Lets break down the user stories with the classic project "Traffic Spy"
  - Build a clickable wireframe of Traffic Spy using Balsamiq
* [Gist for the Class](https://gist.github.com/mdorrance/0542aa31b9328bf80c9c)

Fellow classmates also wanted to learn how to use Bootstrap so that they could then build responsive apps quicker and to transfer their wireframes to html and css so I led a student session on Friday August 7 titled:
* Bootstrap basics (Student-led session, 2-4pm)
  - Gain an understanding of what Bootstrap is
  - Introduce "Mobile First" design, the grid and components of Bootstrap
  - Workshop: Importing Bootstrap into a Rails Project
  - Workshop: Transferring a wireframe to html and css using Bootstrap
