# David Shim - Module 2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Before this module, I had only briefly experienced project management workflow
with Sales Engine. Being able to work with and communicate with all members of
the team in an efficient manner was fairly new to me.  Combining tools such as
waffle.io and private slack channels made communication and project organization
much easier. I believe that I was able to meet the challenge and work well with
my teammates.  

### End of Module Assessment

Notes: David's understanding and grasp of Rails seems adequate to move on to module 3. There was confusion when we got to the view on how to iterate over a collection of users and their plays. The confusion seemed to be due to nerves and once we talked it out, he was able to come up with a solution without assistance. He should spend more time pairing with mentors to help get more comfortable with working with non-peers as this will be important when it comes time for the job hunt.

### Attendance

I attended class every day this module. However, I was tardy on Friday, July 31st.

### Projects

## Team

I completed the following group projects for this module:

#### Traffic Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mitchashby16/traffic_spy)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

  In this two-week project we built a web tracking traffic and analysis tool.  Based on Sinatra, the project was able to receive data via HTTP from a simulation engine.


  * Functional Expectations: 3
  * Test-Driven Development: 3
  * Encapsulation / Components: 3
  * Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2.5
  * Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
  * View Layer: 3

##### My Contribution

  I was primarily responsible for the Application URL statistics and the views.  We all worked on Payload processing to get the project up and running.

##### Takeaway

  * This was our first group project, working with 3 people is significantly different that just pairing.
  * Learned out useful ActiveRecord can be.
  * Learned how to use HTTP requests and how web traffic in general works.



#### Little Shop of Orders

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Alex-Tideman/endangerous_outfitters)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

This was another 2 week project that focused on rails and ActiveRecord databases
as well as using project management techniques that are more like a real world
client-developer relationship.  This has been my favorite project so far

1. Feature Completeness
Score: 4
4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions
3: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented
2: There are one or two features missing or incorrectly implemented
1: There are bugs/crashes in the features present

2. Views
Score: 4
4: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present
3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through
2: Views don't make use of partials or show weak understanding of render
1: Views are poorly organized

3. Controllers
Score: 3
4: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack
3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts
2: There are four to seven ugly controller methods that should have been refactored
1: There are more than seven unsatisfactory controller methods

4. Models
Score: 4
4: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features
3: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring
2: Models are somewhat messy and/or make poor use of Rails features
1: Models show weak use of Ruby and weak structure

5. Testing
Score: 4
4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels
3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features
2: Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels
1: Project did not really attempt to use TDD

6. Usability
Score: 4
4: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers
3: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready
2: Project needs significantly more attention to the User Experience, but works
1: Project is difficult or unpleasant to use

7. Workflow
Score: 4
4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.
3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.
2: Sporadic use of branches, pull requests, and/or project-management tool.
1: Little use of branches, pull requests, and/or a project-management tool.


##### My Contribution

  I was primarily responsible for building the orders database, the associated
  functionality as well as the accompanying tests.  In addition I also, did a lot
  of work on the Activity/Destination views(both index and show) and their styling.
  We all worked on building initial wireframes and writing the schema and relationships
  for our databases. We also mob-coded many of the more advanced features such as the
  Google Maps and AWS/Paperclip integration. I also took a lead role in making sure
  our tests had adequate coverage and were testing our features and models appropriately.

##### Takeaway

  * This was our first rails project.  It was awesome to see something that
    we built; actually functioning on the web.
  * Project Management skills using direct input from the "Client" and building
    the project based around the client's needs and expectations. (Shoutout to Josh
    for taking the extra time to fulfill this role)
  * Learned about the differences between running you project locally versus
    actually running it in production on the web.
  * How to bring together Ruby skills, Rails MVC concepts and experiment
    with JavaScript(Google Maps API).

## Community

### Giving Feedback

  According to my memory:

  * I delivered 100% of the requested feedback in each of the weekly surveys.

  From Traffic Spy:

  * Mitch:  “Shim was a great asset to the team. He was always organized and willing to do whatever it took to get the project done in time"

  * Jason:  "It never seemed like there was stress with each other, just the stress of the project. Dave facilitated this by speaking clearly, explaining things to me when I was confused, and keeping an eye on where the project was at all times. He also put in the effort to make our traffic spy look good, which made the finished product something I could actually show people."

### Playing a Part

  Throughout the six weeks I tried to be more active in the community by spending
  time with classmates outside of school and offering to help Module 1 students when
  I could.

  * On Friday, August 7th, I gave a lightning talk discussing how Bitcoin works and
    it's potential impact on the developing world.
  * On Saturday, August 8th, I wrote a blog post guide on how to setup Rspec and Capybara
    in Rails 4. [Blog Link](http://shim.city/rails/rspec/2015/08/08/Rspec-Capybara-Setup-In-Rails.html)
  * On Thursday, August 13th, I presented and Demo Night along with my group for our
    Little Shop of Orders project.
  * I am currently organizing a friendly poker game for Turning students to occur sometime
    mid-week during intermission.

## Notes

* Assessment was acceptable but didn't feel like it realized your full potential
* Will be a lot of work in module 3 to make sure we're hitting this target
* Group projects are successful; doing well contributing to the team without
introducing any friction
* Would like to see you taking on more challenges during the project group;
make sure we're pushing ourselves
* Group participation is technically competent; would like to see a larger role
in "bringing out the best" in the group
* Feedback / Community involvement: Keep active and pushing yourself to get
off of the periphery of the group -- individual involvement is great as well
* You could be a great asset as a mentor to newer students

## Outcome

* __A: End-of-Module Assessment:__ 3
* __B: Individual Work & Projects:__ 3
* __C: Group Work and Projects:__ 3
* __D: Community Participation:__ 3
* __E: Peer & Instructor Feedback:__ 3
