# Drew Conly - M2 Portfolio

##Individual

###Areas of Emphasis

This module was an introduction to Rails for me. As I had zero technical
experience prior to Turing, my goal is and has been to establish the strongest
foundation that I'm able in order to have a solid starting point for the career
before me. As Rails is used to deploy web applications, my specific goal was to
host a respectable app online.

###End of Module Assessment

My progress will be assessed by Josh Mejia:

###Attendance

I attended every day of class this module with a tardy on Friday July 31st

â€œWorking with Drew was great. He is definitely a hard worker and was willing to
put in the work to get stuff done. Drew is also really good at keeping up a
positive attitude and this helps to reduce the stress in the group"

###Community

###Giving Feedback

I provided feedback for all team members for respective projects as well as for
those from other cohorts that I've paired with.

###Playing a Part

* Across cohorts as well as with mentors, I do my best to assert positivity.
* I delivered a lightning talk regarding taking advice as it was something that
  troubled me during module 1 in particular.
* I organized a camping trip to Turquoise Lake during the intermission week
  preceding module 2.
* I introduced several graduating students to former colleagues of mine in the
  staffing industry hoping that it helped them to get jobs.

###Review

"Notes: Drew's assessment started off slow but he settled in was able to
complete the assigned challenge. It's my opinion that nerves clouded his
judgement in the beginning. We were able to build momentum and it became clear
that he understands the core concepts covered in M2. Writing more Rails specific
code involving ActiveRecord should make it so nerves don't interfere with his
knowledge. Scheduling more pairing sessions with non-peers would be a great
exercise and will likely help him get more comfortable pairing with experienced
developers."

* Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking: 3
* Ruby Syntax & Standard Library: 3

### Outcome
