# Lovisa Svallingson - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
In module 1 I was quite introverted and preferred to work by myself and didn't
interact much with the other students in my cohort. I was, and still am, extremely
focused on the work that we are doing and unfortunately some of the social aspects
of being a student at Turing are suffering due to this.

That's why this module I have tried to reach out more (I don't know i anyone
noticed) and am trying to get projects started such as the podcast and hopefully
an open source project.

I also have a tendency to take the group leader role in group projects and I wanted
to practice being on a team instead of leading a team.

### End of Module Assessment

## Scores

### Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

Score: 4

* Good analysis of the problem, reasons why we want this feature, what will be involved.
* Also keeping this in mind and amending it as we get more context.
* Quickly comes up with the algorithm to do the scoring and sorting for the view

### Ruby Syntax & Standard Library

Score: 3

* Uses Ruby to make sense of Rails (ie gaining access to the `Play#score` functionality via moving the method to a clas method)
* Capacity to reason about return values and types, even prior to running code
* Keep in mind that you can often normalize the null-case (ie we get `nil` instead of a string of space separated words, then call `to_s`).
* A bit of confusion regarding `self` (controller trying to call model method, instance trying to call method defined on the class)
* Quickly identifies how object model implies issues, and modifies the implementation accordingly

### Rails Syntax & API

Score: 3+

* Good familiarity with each of the pieces, including knowing where to look for things,
  and the sets of potential reasons that we could be seeing issues.

### Rails Style

Score: 4

* Pushes the word sorting / scoring down into the model (good)
* Pulls the scoring out of the Play instance, where it obviously doesn't belong
  (wonderful! b/c is willing to make the necessary changes to improve existing design, this is very valuable)


### Testing

Score: 3+

* Good test, though probably name it after the feature, "Highest Scoring Word"
* One thing to be careful with is being overly specific with content on the page
  (this can change for any number of reasons, breaking the test when the underlying functionality is the same)
* Would be worth testing `score_and_sort` at a lower level

### Collaboration

Score: 4

* Good initial communication

feedback from Marla:

* I enjoyed working with you because we have very similar working styles and it was easy to both learn from you and show you new things. We had productive conversations about technical choices we were making and it felt very collaborative.

* Solid individual academic progress
* Consistently going beyond the basic assignments and exhibiting curiosity
* Exhibiting a pleasant curiosity and interest in understanding deeper issues behind
technical tools
* Doing well with managing stress and mental well-being during the module's assignments
* A little bit of a "passenger seat" attitude with the cohort's interactions and personal
feedback -- would like to see more of your opinions and critical feedback coming into the
forefront
