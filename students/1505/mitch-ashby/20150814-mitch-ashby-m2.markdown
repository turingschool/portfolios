#**Mitch Ashby - Module 2 Portfolio**
Individual

###**Areas of Emphasis**

This module I really wanted to work on my ability to work with others. I think that I can grasp material with minimal effort but something that I have struggled with in the past is my ability to communicate my ideas out loud. I also have a tendency to go off to explore a problem without bringing my partners up to speed.

###**End of Module Assessment**

        Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking: 3
        Ruby Syntax & Standard Library: 3
        Rails Syntax & API: 4
        Rails Style: 3
        Testing: 3.5
        Collaboration: 3


I was here every day, however, I was late on one day for personal reasons.

###**Projects**

I completed the following projects for this module:

####**TrafficSpy**

GitHub URL: https://github.com/mitchashby16/traffic_spy
Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/traffic_spy.markdown

In this week long project we implemented a web application that will monitor and analyze web traffic for a registered user. I was working with David Shim and Jason Wright and they had this to say

Jason -> “Open to feedback and willing to say exactly how he felt about shared decisions and why he felt that way. I felt that was valuable because it never got into a situation where it was blame, we were all in this together.  During stressful times we could still joke with each other and lower the stress instead of just letting it build”

David -> “Was great working with him.  If anyone was feeling stressed out, Mitch was always the voice of reason.  He’s also a great coder that was able to help out when we needed it.”

        Functional Expectations: 3
        Test-Driven Development: 3
        Encapsulation / Components: 3
        Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2.5
        Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
        View Layer: 3


####**LittleShop**

GitHub URL: https://github.com/marlabrizel/jurassic_parka
Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown

        Feature Completeness: 3.5
        Views: 3
        Controllers: 3
        Models: 4
        Testing: 3.5
        Usability: 2
        Workflow: 4

This two week long project involved making an e-commerce site. Our team was really good at splitting up the work so that everyone was able to touch a variety of the different components. During the first part of the assignment I spent a lot of time on the backend working with the models and controllers. Later on, I knew I wanted to get better at styling so I focused on styling with css and bootstrap.

Drew -> “Mitch is always enjoyable to work with both for his work ethic and his demeanor. His focus and nuanced sense of humor allows for progress without feeling as though we’re being overworked. Makes projects enjoyable.”


Takeaway

Bootstrap can be neat but I definitely prefer not worrying about styling
When the work is broken down into pieces it is much more manageable
We’ve retained a lot of the information thrown at us in module 2


###**Giving Feedback**

Feedback I received :

George 1507 -> “Thanks for being a strong member of Lovelace for me to try to model after. I wanted to let you know that when Jeff asked in our Friday talk, “Who outside of 1507 has been a good/helpful mentor” that at least 3/4 of us mentioned you RIGHT AWAY! I think it is great that even upperclassmen go to you for assistance!  Anyway, you helped me fairly regularly in the mornings and we worked through some warm-ups together. “



###**Playing a Part**

Throughout the six weeks I pushed myself to help as many people as I could with various projects.

During week 4 and 5, I spent a lot of time paring with people in 1507 on different projects such as enigma and sales engine.
During week 5, I spent an hour in the afternoon pairing with Rebekah and Rachel from 1507.
During week 6 I helped to organize a camping trip for the weekend of intermission week.
