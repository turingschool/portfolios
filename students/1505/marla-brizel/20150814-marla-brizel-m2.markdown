# Marla Brizel - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module, my main goal was to begin laying a foundation of knowledge for building robust web applications, while continuing to expand upon my Ruby knowledge. I also wanted to work on better managing my stress during the program. During Module 1, I often felt stressed to the point that I would forget how much I actually do enjoy coding.

### End of Module Assessment

Assessor: Josh Mejia
I received the following scores and feedback on the end of module assessment:

###### Scores
* Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking *Score: 3.5*
* Ruby Syntax & Standard Library *Score: 3*
* Rails Syntax & API *Score: 3.5*
* Rails Sytle *Score: 4*
* Testing *Score: 4*
* Collaboration *Score 4*

**Notes**
Overall solid understanding of Rails. Marla would benefit from practicing Ruby enumerables as some of the things that were really strong at the end of M1 aren't as strong. Great use of TDD -- it seems really natural to her. She is in a good place and understands all of the core concepts covered in M2.

**My comments**
Josh's feedback about Ruby enumerables is valid; I unfortunately did not spend as much time as I would have liked this module doing pure Ruby exercises. I have already contacted my mentor about this and we will be working though Ruby Koans together.

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time, with the exception of an excused half-day absence on July 24. I had a doctor's appointment that morning because I had been sick for over a month and wasn't getting better.

### Work

#### Personal Website

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlabrizel/personal)
* [Website](http://www.marlabrizel.com)

In this project, I built a personal website from scratch using HTML and CSS. I connected this website to a custom domain and linked it to my Jekyll blog.

#### Doggy Daycare

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlabrizel/doggy_daycare)
* [Heroku](https://dog-e-daycare.herokuapp.com)

This is an ongoing "breakable toy" sort of project. Its purpose is to reinforce basic Rails concepts covered in class in one cohesive project. I used it mainly as a place to do homework assignments for a second time after first completing the assignments as outlined. I also used it to practice deploying to Heroku.

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlabrizel/idea_box)

In this Rails mini-project, I built a webapp for recording and storing ideas. My goals for this project were to solidify basic CRUD principles, practice building authentication and authorization, and get more practice building a Capybara/RSpec test suite.

#### Contact Manager

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlabrizel/contact_manager)
* [Heroku](https://stormy-beach-4002.herokuapp.com/)

This was our first sizeable Rails project, in tutorial form. Given that this was an early project, my main goal was to become more comfortable with basic Rails concepts.

#### Robot World

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlabrizel/robot_world)

This project was one of my first web applications. Concepts covered included CRUD, Sinatra, HTTP, and ERB.

#### Space Adventure

* [Github URL](https://github.com/marlabrizel/space_adventure)

Not a real project, per se, but I pushed this repository up to keep track of the work done during Yong Bakos' Swift sessions.

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following group projects:

#### Traffic Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/applegrain/traffic-spy)

In this week-long project, I with two other teammates built an analytics
platform for website traffic. We focused on understanding HTTP requests, got an introduction to JSON, and worked on PostgreSQL-flavored ActiveRecord queries. I particularly enjoyed the chance to practice ActiveRecord as well as refactor code.

Evaluator: Rachel
###### Scores
* Functional Expectations: 3.5
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation / Components: 3.5
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 4
* View Layer: 3.5

We received compliments from Rachel, who told us during the evaluation that it was one of the cleanest Traffic Spy implementations she had ever seen.

#### Little Shop of Orders (FKA Dinner Dash)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlabrizel/jurassic_parka)
* [Heroku](https://jurassic-parka.herokuapp.com)

In this two-week project, my group implemented Jurassic Parka, an e-commerce
site. I played a team lead role and was in charge of all production deploys. I played a part in setting up the item model. I also authored the shopping cart using POROs, custom controller actions, member routes, and complex views. I pushed myself to use jQuery over Ruby for order filtering in order to create a better user experience. I also personally wrote an extension to implement a sales/discount concept. Finally, I spent time towards the end of the project attempting to improve our test coverage.

Evaluator: Josh
###### Scores
* Feature Completeness: 3.5
* Views: 3
* Controllers: 3
* Models: 4
* Testing: 3.5
* Usability: 2
* Workflow: 4

### Feedback to Me

* **Lovisa Svallingson**, Traffic Spy teammate: "I really enjoyed working with you because you made it easy to be very direct with you. We could be very direct with each other in terms of expectations, what needed to be done and we discussed like adults when we had differing opinions on whatever. And you were good knowing when you could let us wear the project management hat and when it was good for you to step in and lead."

* **Rose Kohn**, 1507: "You were the first person to reach out and offer help before we came to school.  Your help continued through the module, and your explanation of the tough relationship on Sales Engine made it all clear for me."

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I gave honest feedback to all who requested it and filled out all end-of-project feedback forms.

### Playing a Part

* On Friday, July 17, I ran a student-led workshop on Scrum and Sprint Planning
* On Sunday, July 19, I went on a fly fishing trip with other students/staff
* On Friday, July 31, I delivered a lightning talk titled "Using Agile to Manage Your Life"
* On Friday, July 31, I helped transport other students to Field Day
* Throughout the module, I attended Tuesday morning Joan Clarke Society coffee meetups to mentor, be mentored by, and collaborate with other Turing women
* Throughout the module, I participated in Student Advisory Board.
* I gave an interview to a videographer producing a piece on the Turing experience.
* I provided assistance to 1507 with their projects, both proactively and when asked.
* I attended Denver.rb in July and August
* I submitted a session proposal for Denver Startup Week called "I'm a Female and Code Curious: Now What?" and it was accepted - hooray!

###### I published the following posts on my [personal blog](http://marlabrizel.github.io/):
* My Friend the Stack Trace (also featured on the [Turing blog](http://blog.turing.io/2015/08/03/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-bomb/))
* Learn HTML and CSS (From a Book!)
* Redefining Failure


## Review

### Notes

* Great asset in group work scenarios -- Marla's teams seem to consistently
outperform other teams thanks to her participation
* Enjoyment of work? -- do you actually like doing the work? Last project
seemed to involve a lot of stress and some interpersonal issues that made it
less enjoyable
* Challenge going forward: you have aptitude to excel at whichever portions
of the discipline you're interested in, but can we find one that you enjoy
or are particularly excited about or interested in
* You are perceptive and give prescient feedback; perhaps sometimes too
biting so people take it harshly. Perhaps we can soften this

### Outcome

* __B: Individual Work & Projects:__ 3
* __C: Group Work and Projects:__ 4
* __D: Community Participation:__ 3
* __E: Peer & Instructor Feedback:__ 3
