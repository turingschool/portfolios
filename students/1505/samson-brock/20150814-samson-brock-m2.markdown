# Samson Brock - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

For Module 2, my goal was to continue to work hard learning Sinatra and Rails
while maintaining my newly acquired Ruby skills and starting to re-learn
JavaScript. I also wanted to improve my soft skills including pairing, group
work, workflow, and mentoring. Last but not least, I wanted to be an active
part of both the Turing community and the community outside of Turing.

I paired with mentors on Ruby and JavaScript exercises. I paired and mob coded
with different people and teams. I actively participated in all Turing
activities, and made contributions wherever I saw the opportunity.

### End of Module Assessment

Joshua Mejia:
"Sam is a really strong developer and has a great process for tackling problems.
He has a solid grasp of all key learning points in M2. Moving forward, I suggest
modeling more complex database relationships, not because I see any
deficiencies, but because I think he would find it interesting. I'd love to see
Sam have fun and experiment with technologies that interest him over the next
two modules."

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time.

### Work

I completed the following team projects this module:

#### Traffic Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imwithsam/traffic-spy)
* [Original
  Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/traffic-spy-skeleton)

This group project served as our first major introduction to building a web app.
We used Sinatra with ActiveRecord. We largely mob coded on this project.

Joshua Mejia:
"Really solid project. Naturally using presenter pattern."

Sebastian Abondano:
"Sam's energy and enthusiasm is infectious. From staying up to date with the
latest happenings in the tech world, to attending meetups and doing pushups and
squats during pomodoro breaks at Turing, he is consistently motivating those
around him to do more. His calm demeanor and strong analytical skills were a
great asset to our team while working on the 'Little Shop of Orders' project. He
was a pleasure to work with and someone I would want to work with again in the
future."

Michael Dorrance:
"I have had the good fortune to work with Sam on two very successful projects,
Traffic Spy and Redrum Nursery. Sam is a diligent problem with a strong
understanding of OOP, Ruby, Rails and an acute attention to detail. He is a
solid team member who is willing to tackle any aspect of the project. Sam is
respectful, personable and committed to doing great work. He also takes the time
to explain any code that he is writing to make sure that you, as a partner,
understand what is going on. I would work with Sam on any project in the
future."

Michael Reeves:
"I could not be prouder of the team I had for Redrum Nursery. Sam really
gutted it out on the project, pulling some pretty late nights. He and Mike
Dorrance did a great job of pulling the user authentication and
authorization processes together. Sam worked very hard on this project, and I
can't thank him enough."

## Community

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

### Playing a Part

I have helped mentor/pair with students in Module 1, and do my best to be a good
example by actively participating in morning warmpups and Friday activities. I
also do little things like buy coffee beans, make coffee, clean and do dishes, etc. on
an ongoing basis. I organized a couple of outings (hiking, UMS) for Turing
students. I gave a Lightning Talk on Turing Pro Tips, in part trying to inform
and encourage students to foster a healthier and better learning environment.
I started a Turing Wiki. I contributed pull requests to Jumpstart Labs / Turing School lessons. I made an
extra effort to thoroughly and thoughtfully fill out all my weekly surveys.

I created a Jekyll blog and wrote a few blog posts covering effective learning, and Ruby modules.

Outside of Turing, I attended many different MeetUps including Denver.rb,
Boulder Ruby, DenverScript, and ReactJS.
