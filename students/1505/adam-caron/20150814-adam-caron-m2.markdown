### Areas of Emphasis

What I set out to accomplish this module:
This module I set out to significantly benefit everyone at Turing and its surrounding community, including myself.
 - I aimed to be the best academic student I could be,
 - the strongest project team-member I could be,
 - and by having the most beneficial presence I could have for myself and those around me.

 It was also a priority of mine to focus on individuals within the Turing community who inspire me and who embody traits that I aspire to cultivate.
