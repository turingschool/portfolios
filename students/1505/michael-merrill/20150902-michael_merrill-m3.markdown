# Michael Merrill - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

After taking time off between module two and three, my goal for returning to Turing was to fully immerse myself in learning code and be the most active participant in each project I attempted. For this module I eliminated almost all distractions (besides running) to learn and practice as much coding as possible. My goal everyday was to learn a little more everyday and I feel proud of the work I accomplished in the past 6 weeks. For the next 6 weeks, my goal is to take the same approach to learning JS. I had a rule for this past module to "not let the first time I see a specific set of code be in class." This kept me ahead of the game a little and I'd like to continue that into my JavaScript path.

### End of Module Assessment



### Attendance

I missed one day this past module due to personal/family reasons. I also left early one day to leave for Wyoming and train for an upcoming marathon.

### Work

I completed the following projects for this module.

#### Apicurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelkm/gramgram)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

    Completion: 3
    Organization: 1
    Test-Driven Development: 1
    Code Quality: 2
    User Experience: 3


#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelkm/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rales_engine.md)

Good testing, but had a few errors. Might be due to working with the .yml fixtures. Good use of active record queries but jumped into a few ruby enumerables.

    Completion: 3
    Test-Driven Development: 4
    Code Quality: 3
    API Design: 4
    Queries: 3

#### Ion (Personal Project)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelkm/ion)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

Ion is a modern missed connection app, which consumes the facebook and mapbox api. It allows users to connect via location based posts.

    Completion: 4 - Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely     manner.
    Organization: 3 - Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
    Test-Driven Development: 3 - Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).
    Code Quality: 4 - Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
    User Experience: 4 - Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.
    Performance:Skylight not installed - heroku logs show fast load times.

## Team

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Imagine (The Pivot)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mrjaimisra/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

    Completion: 3: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
    Organization: 4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
    Test-Driven Development: 4: Coverage was good, showed understanding at all levels.
    Code Quality: 3.5: Code was better factored than most, controllers were mostly skinny, wouldn't call it "Exceptional" though.
    User Experience: 4: Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.


> Michael and I paired a lot during the pivot. He really did a fantastic job, and worked hard with me. > I'd be really excited to work with him again anytime. -MR

> Michael is a talented front-end designer and valuable member on group projects. While he sometimes
> has a tendency to go off on his own rather than working with the group the whole time, he is nearly
> always available when the group needs him and is a valuable contributor when pairing. I have worked
> with Michael several times and would definitely do so again.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

> Michael and I paired during The-Pivot and it was truly a pleasure. I believe that a rare quality in
> almost any profession is the ability to actually 'finish' a project. They say that last 5% is the
> hardest to accomplish. Michael is a finisher. Someone who won't stop working until the last 5% is
> done and done well.

### Being a Community Member

> "Some feedback from Penney's survey results: "Lovisa, Marla, Jai, and Michael (Merrill) - THANK YOU
> for the kind words, the pep talks, the check-ins, and the technical help. You guys kept me afloat
> this week in more ways that I can say." JC

### Playing a Part

I don't know why, but I tend to be console for a few people who go to this school and I like to think I supply wisdom. Turing can be pretty chaotic at times and I'm happy to give advice that puts things in perspective. I feel like I've played the part by being a sounding board for quite a few people here.
