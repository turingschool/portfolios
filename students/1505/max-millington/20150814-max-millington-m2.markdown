# Max Millington - Module2 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

Besides learning rails, sinatra, css, html, activerecord, and like a million other module 2 things, 
I didn't want to let my ruby skills decay. Accordingly, I did a bunch of exercisms to help keep my ruby
knowledge fresh. https://github.com/MaxMillington/exercism 

### End of Module Assessment

My end of module assessment was performed by Josh Mejia. He gave me the following feedback: 

"Notes: Really strong assessment. 
Solid grasp of core Rails concepts. 
Only hiccup was with instantiating an instance of a model (Play) and how to do that without a strong params hash.
The ability to think through the hiccup was quick and logical.
We worked on implementing a feature using techniques that weren't covered in class and everything went smoothly."

Josh Mejia evaluated us.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

 I gave feedback to my group. 

### Playing a Part

* I delivered a lightning talk on Pizza.

* I helped some 1507 people sometimes.
* I am going to give a talk at boulder rb during intermission.

## Review

### Notes

* Individual and Group technical and academic progress is very strong
* Strive to be more engaged in group dynamics; this can take the form of
1-on-1 interactions just as much as large-group interactions
* You are pretty successful at delivering honest and critical feedback in
a productive way, at least at the staff
* Keep this up toward the staff, but strive to bring this into your interactions
with other students as well
* We want to create an environment where this type of feedback is regular and
habitual, and we need you to play an active part in creating this environment
