# Jason Wright - Module 2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I felt that I have struggled using an Agile process on team projects. In most team projects we started good but then the process and best practices started getting ignored as the feeling of 'we are so far behind' set it. It seemed obvious from the early commits to the latter that the code degraded. Bugs also took longer to find and fix. I worked on figuring out a workflow that keeps waffle clean, keeps our code clean, and that isn't so heavy that the process seems like a burden. To keep waffle clean we started using appropriate tags, submitting our pull requests correctly to take advantage of waffle/github integration, and trying to work directly from the cards. I have also started reviewing all the pull requests almost line by line and asking questions about what I don't understand and discussing suggestions on how to make it cleaner. This is still a work in progress but I feel I have improved over module 1 and module 2.

### End of Module Assessment

My progress through the module was assessed by Josh Cheek and here are the
results:

"You seem nervous, but I want you to do well!"

**Note: the assessment took 45 minutes.**

Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking: 3
* Generally correct assessment

Ruby Syntax & Standard Library: 3
* Nothing problematic within our uninteresting set of possibilities

Rails Syntax & API: 4
* Nice using your editor to move shit around and reformat
* Nice making sense of the view

Rails Syntax & API: 4
* Migrations / models / associations were all fine

Testing: 3
* Reasonable test

Collaboration: 3
* You seem nervous, but I want you to do well!

### Attendance

I missed the morning of August 10 because I stayed up all night and part of Monday morning correcting  LSoO code that I did incorrectly over the weekend.

### Projects

We did not have any individually accessed projects this module

## Team

### Projects

  I participated in the following team projects:

#### LSoO (Dinners Ready 4 U)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/applegrain/dinners_ready)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

  This two week long project was our first experience building a rails application and deploying it to Heroku. Our project was evaluated by Josh M. with the following results:

 * Feature Completeness: 4
 * Views: 3.5
 * Controllers: 3.5
 * Models: 4
 * Testing: 4
 * Usability: 3
 * Workflow: 4

##### My Contribution

  I wrote worked on the Orders, Category's, and base bootstrap styling. We also paired on Admin pages and the visual design of the site. I helped with everything else as needed.

##### Takeaway

  * I had fun pairing
  * Writing feature tests first really helps out in the long run
  * We had a really great team that worked well together
  * Reviewing checked in code is actually really helpful

#### Traffic Spy

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/noobjey/traffic_spy)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/5cd41b3635cc4d32431032d42bcfc9f7da3135d5/source/projects/traffic_spy.markdown)

  This week-and-a-half long project introduced us to using an mvc framework to build a function web application.:

  "It was fun, but more challenging than I thought it would be."

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2.5
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
* View Layer: 3

##### My Contribution

 We developed the initial framework and design as a group. We then split up to handle separate pieces of the project. We collaborated the entire project to make sure everyone was on the same page and worked together to fix anything that was not working out.

##### Takeaway

  * Trying to use agile processes is hard 
  * Having good tests save you during the final push
  
##### Feedback
*  “Working with Jason was great. He is definitely a hard worker and was willing to stay up late to get work done.”
* "Jason was a strong member of the team and was able to quickly and accurately complete everything that was asked of him.  He always had a great attitude and was always willing to help if anyone had any issues."

## Community

### Giving Feedback

  According to the Feedback application:

  * I believe I left feedback every week

### Playing a Part

  Throughout the six weeks I paired with far more people than I did in Module 1. It was really fun actually being able to help Module 1 people. 

  * Our posse put forth a strong effort on the warm-ups, which was really fun
  * My lighting talk was Javascript Testing with Jasmine (I learned I am terrible at keynote)
  * The student led sessions I participated in this module were really helpful
