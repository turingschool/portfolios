# Michael Reeves - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I wanted to understand how to use Sinatra and get a basic feel of Rails.  Looking back I'm surprised at how many Rails projects we accumulated in such a short time period.  I think I've laid a pretty solid foundation for moving forward.

### End of Module Assessment

* Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking: 3
* Ruby Syntax & Standard Library: 3
* Rails Syntax & API: 3
* Rails Style: 3
* Testing: 3
* Collaboration: 3

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes.

### Work

I completed the following work this module:

#### Task Manager

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michael-reeves/task_manager)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/task_manager.markdown)

Gain a basic understanding of HTTP Requests using Sinatra to build an app which
manages tasks.  We used this application repeatedly during the first few weeks
of the module.

#### Blogger 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michael-reeves/blogger)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html)

This project was about becoming familiar with Rails MVC architecture,
Rails routes, Migrations, Views, and RESTful design.  I enjoyed seeing
how adding the index and create functionality of one Controller could be
embedded in the views of another Controller.

#### Contact Manager

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michael-reeves/contact_manager)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/contact_manager.html)

This two day project was to build an application to manage contact.  It was
a follow along tutorial to set us up for further lessons.

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michael-reeves/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

This project was designed to help tie all the pieces of Rails together.  It
occurred right after we had covered authorization and authentication, and
was a lead-in to Little Shop of Horrors.

In this app, I implemented all the views with HAML, which was a great learning
experience.

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects.

#### Traffic-Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/applegrain/traffic-spy)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/5cd41b3635cc4d32431032d42bcfc9f7da3135d5/source/projects/traffic_spy.markdown)

This week-long project involved getting comfortable with HTTP Requests.  It was evaluated by Rachel who said:

This is probably the best Traffic Spy that I've seen.

* Functional Expectations: 3.5
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation / Components: 3.5
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michael-reeves/redrum_nursery)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

This 10 day project demonstrated building out a e-commerce site using Agile
processes.  It was evaluated by Josh Mejia who said:

This was one of the strongest, if not the strongest of the dinner dash type projects I've seen.

> Mike is probably the strongest overall programmer in our cohort. More
> importantly, he takes the time to share his knowledge and experience
> with his fellow students despite his long daily commute. He led a helpful
> session on whiteboarding and basic algorithms. He was easy to work with on
> the Little Shop of Orders project. - Sam Brock

> Mike brings decades of professional programming experience to our Redrum
> Nursery. As our team lead for the project, Mike ensured that the team made
> decisions we all agreed upon and kept our personal commitments to our project
> timeline. Mike is a great coach and teacher too. He reads all pull requests
> and is committed to strong code. He is not just a strong developer but also a
> great project manager and team lead.  Mike is approachable, calm and
> compassionate and a person I would work with on any project in the future. - Mike Dorrance

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I came to Turing to learn Rails and Agile development.  I feel incredibly
lucky to be part of this environment where I'm surrounded by great minds
all the time.

I want to give shout outs to everyone in 1505, as well as many people in
other cohorts and the instructors.

### Playing a Part

I support Turing by taking time to assist other students with their
projects, even when it means I miss my train and don't get home until
late.  For me, helping others out is a core mission.

I helped many 1507 students with Chisel, Linked Lists, Mythical
Creatures, Merge Sorts and a little bit on Sales Engine.

Not only do I give lightning talks, but I have also decided to sponsor a
regular technical white boarding group for the remainder of the time that
I'm here.
