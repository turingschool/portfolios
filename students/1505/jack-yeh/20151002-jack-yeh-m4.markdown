**Feature Completion:**       1: Team completed the user stories and requirements partially.
**Project Organization:**     2: Team used a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently.
**Test-Driven Development:**  1: Code coverage was below 70%
**Code Quality:**             3: What code was there was excellent, but it was clear that there were large gaps due to the missing stories. Their cart in particular had almost no code. I wouldn't feel comfortable giving a higher grade with so many potential code monsters left unexplored.
**User Experience:**          2: Project exhibits some gaps in the UX.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

### Being a Community Member
"Jack is one of the most thoughtful, knowledgable, and pleasant team member's I've worked with. During our project, Jack had to leave town for the weekend. Halfway around the world, he was communicating with us, submitting pull requests with meaningful contributions, and participating in team meetings: more than anyone could ask from a team member. I've learned a lot working with Jack and thoroughly enjoyed having him as a classmate. “ - Adam Caron
"Jack is perfect" ~ Sally
“I think the dynamics of 1505 would have been very different without Jack. You are really great to be around and working with you makes me a more mindful developer. I see you helping a lot of students in other cohorts and I wish I had energy to do that as well! You are a great developer, an even better friend and I’m excited to do module 4 with you!" ~ Lovisa

### Playing a Part
I volunteered at Rocky Mountain Ruby for 3 days.
