# (Sebastian Abondano) - (M2) Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
Coming into this module I wanted to focus on:
* Ruby
* Rails 

Other:
I read "The Little Book of Talent" and "The Talent Code" with the goal
of learning more about how talent/mastery is developed.

I went through the Mastering Ruby Blocks &
Iterators course on PragmaticStudio.
 

### End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

Notes: Sebastian didn't get as far in the assessment as I know he is capable of. He was hindered by nerves and made a few decisions early on that we needed to backtrack on. Once we got into a flow everything went well. More practice pairing with mentors or other non-peers will be helpful. Overall understanding is good and he knows how to accomplish essential tasks in Rails.

(feedback to me)
Feedback from TrafficSpy team: Dedication and genuine interest in code; he was able to push forward every evening



Feedback from Patrick: "Sebastian, I've paired with you a few times and I remember you being a very active pairing partner. Whether driving or not you were very participatory which isn't an easy skill to learn right away. You seemed to ask the right questions and I think we were able to gel well fairly quickly on problems."

#### (Little Shop of Orders)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sabondano/redrum_nursery)

(feedback to me)
Feedback from Sam: “Sebastian is one of those people everyone really likes as a person and thoroughly enjoys working with. He is incredibly nice and friendly to everyone. That combined with his strong passion and talent for programming makes him quite the rare breed indeed. I am glad to be in the same cohort as Sebastian, and enjoyed working with him on the Little Shop of Orders project. He was a strong contributor and easy to work with."

Feedback from Reeves: “Sebastian has really has been a joy to be around the entire time I’ve been at Turing.  He’s like this secret gem hiding in the background.  He’s quiet, but immensely talented.  He really crushed Redrum Nursery.  We could not possibly have accomplished what we did without Sebastian’s hard work, dedication and raw talent.  I really hope I get to work with him again.

Feedback from Dorrance: "I had a great time working with Michael Dorrance on the “The Little Shop of Orders” project! I learned a ton from him during the project. From UX and CSS, to dedication and how to work hard. He was a great contributor to our project and I would enjoy working with him again in the future."

## Community

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
* I wrote two different blog posts this module. One of them was posted on the Turing blog.
* I participated in events like the Cuernavaca Park field day.
* I'm always willing to help fellow students out and do so often.
* I reached out to people that work in the tech industry to learn from them and tell them about Turing.
* I helped out with getting breakfast for everyone at Turing.
* I've enjoyed coming in to Turing before 8:30am to help people out when they ask for help.

## Review

### Notes

* Great academic and technical performance
* Strong factor in groups performing at a high level
* Would like to see you deliver more honest and critical feedback 
* Would like to see you opening up more with direct communication
* Too interesting and have too much potential to be lurking on the periphery
of the community. need to find a way to bring more of your energy and interest
into the center of the community
