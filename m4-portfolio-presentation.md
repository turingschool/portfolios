# Module 4 Portfolio Presentation

## Learning Goals

* Gain comfort speaking about and defending their work and code using correct technical vocabulary
* Practice speaking in front of a group
* Build the skill of storytelling by presenting a compelling story about themselves and their work

## Requirements

* Students will prepare a markdown document and submit a pull request to the Turing Portfolios Repository using the template provided (more detail below under ***Submittal***).
* Students will also prepare a 10-12 minute slide presentation to give to a panel of 3-4 reviewers.

#### Both markdown document and slide presentation are to tell the same story, and should address the following questions:

* What was your biggest achievement of the module?
* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

#### The presentation should not only be a series of slides that directly answers each of these questions with bullet points, but instead should:

* Follow a narrative format -- this is an opportunity to fine tune your story and how you speak about your work. Slides should flow naturally from one to the next.
* Include images and graphics to illustrate the concepts you plan to discuss. These may include screenshots/animated gifs of an application you created, snippets of code from your projects, diagrams of interesting concepts/structures that you used in your project(s).

## Submittal

* Students will submit a pull request of their markdown document to the [Turing Portfolios Repository](https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios) no later than 8:30 am on Thursday of Week 6.
* The pull request will add a single file in a directory with their name in their cohort directory and will be named with the date, their name, and their module (e.g. `/students/1801-back/jeff-casimir/20180301-jeff-casimir-m4.md`). Pull requests that change/delete the existing template, or add/remove/edit other files will be closed.
* The markdown file should include a link to your 30-day post graduation action plan.
