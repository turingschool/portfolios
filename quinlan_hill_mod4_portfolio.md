## A: End of Module Assessment

I completed all the projects, but was late in submitting mod4 portfolio.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I enjoyed the individual project and felt confident in my ability.

#### Palette Picker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/quinhill/palette-picker)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/palette-picker.html)

Palette Picker was challenging for two reasons beyond the small amount of time alotted for it. Working in vanillaJS and JQuery was the first. Having become used to React, going back to JQuery and DOM-manipulation was tough, but fun. The second, was implementing Node.js, a completely new concept to me.

I felt good about how it turned out. Also being the first app I deployed. I felt that although my understanding of Node.js was still shaky, I was able to get everything to work, and ended up with a satisfying app.

#### Pattrn Party

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/quinhill/pattrn-party)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/pattrn-party.html)

I found Pattrn Party to be a useless, time-consuming project. I would much rather have poured my energy into one of the other five things I was trying to focus on in this mod.

Completed the project

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects were very challenging and came at a time when I was putting a lot of pressure on myself to apply for jobs. I felt mixed about the results

#### House of Vars

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/house-of-vars.html)

I did not enjoy this project. We had some communication issues in our team and I didn't take it as seriously as I should have. We were close to having a PR merged, but failed, due to my bad git flow.

We completed the assignment, but could have gotten more out of it.

#### Build Your Own Backend

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/andrew-t-james/byob)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/build-your-own-backend.html)

Build your own backend was a straightforward project. I was partnered with Andrew who has a solid grip of Node.js. The challenge for us was implementing CI. My understanding of it, was not strong and I pushed code that didn't passing tests. We did get it deployed and passing in Travis in the end.

Completed the project.

#### Capstone: RTD-Mobile-App

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Awiedenman/rtd-mobile-app)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)

I am very proud of our capstone project. It is an app that addresses an issue that has frustrated me in the real world.
We have made an app that is a more practical version of the existing RTD app, which is horribly designed.

Completed the capstone and will present it at demo night.
