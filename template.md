## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual projects this mod were Number Guesser and three static composition challenges.

#### Number Guesser

* https://github.com/brandido/number-guesser
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.  The application generates a random number in the range and gives feedback based on if the user guess is too high, too low or correct.

#### Static Comp Challenges

I was given a series of three static compositions and asked to recreate them with a responsive design while respecting the integrity of the original design. The creative license included copy, images, icons and color palette.
