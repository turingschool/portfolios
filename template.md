# (Sabrin Nasreddi) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
Javascript, Mythical creatures,.

I set out to pass mod 1,  grow, learn/improve as much as I can and feel comfortable with the material. I barely knew anything the first time around and felt intimidated but this time around, I helped several people find their way and explained to them how to perform certain functionalities in projects. I took the lead in most projects.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: Monday -2.8 Tuesday -2.8 Wednesday quizlet 4
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 2
* **E: Community Participation**: 3.5

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)
I believe I passed. I got 2 'soft passes' on Monday and Tuesday, and I felt confident with passing the javascript quizlet we took.  I ran the tests as I was working, and all my tests passed. Also all my projects are drastic improvements from last mod and I've been reworking ideaBox the past couple days.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I created new comps this mod that had more creativity, and implemented code more thoughtfully and in a smarter way. I really understood the value of wireframing and made sure I did that before . 

(Intro)

#### (Static Comp Challenge #1)

* [https://github.com/Sabrincodes/StaticComp1-b]()
* [Original Assignment]()

(The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. This is the most basic stat comp.

#### (Stat Comp 2

* [https://github.com/Sabrincodes/sn-comp-challenge-2()
* [Original Assignment]()

This stat involved individual cards(total 8) and was a more complex project. It was the first one where we used normalize.css and grid was a big part of the project. There was a lot of detail to text 'grouping' and icons in the card.

#### (Stat Comp 3

* [https://github.com/Sabrincodes/SN-comp-challenge-3-]()
* [Original Assignment]()

(This was our final stat comp. It involved taking an original comp provided and recreating one like it. ths was a complicated big comp with a lot of details. It was fun to work on but the challenge was the timing of it being assigned. 

(-Make sure text is lined up in their containers more accurately. 
-Pay attention to button colors and that thy're very close to original, and additional highlighting with hover states like a background of button color change'.
-Grouping classes was generally good, but there were some cases that could be dryed up
Central line doesn't look like the comp, make it match it 
-Button should be added in graph section
-Would've been better if you created the actual graph instead of using an image
-media query should be brushed up
-some cases in html could've been semantic like 'aside' for side bar instead of section
-dry up code in media query section
-pay attention to spacing

### Projects


#### ( Number Guesser)

* https://github.com/Sabrincodes/NumGuesser
(Number guesser is a an interactive game I built using vanilla javascript. This was a fun project and I go to the 3rd level whic I was really proud of.  We used vanilla javascript and this is the project where we're introduced top parsent(). The parseInt() function parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix

(html
* less is more with aria labels (only add them if there is a need for more context)

css
* pull out duplicate declarations into a more broad class ie. maybe a `.btn` class
* consider adding organizational comments

js
* work on style - check out the style guides

## Functional Expectations

* Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.  





## C: Group Work & Projects

I worked on three group projects that went really well pairing wise. I worked with David on Idea-Box, Adam on Linked-List and Chris on 2DoBox-Pivot. Adam and David didn't have any experience so it was good to explain everything to them and play the driver role as I showed them how to do what was being asked of us. 

* Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.

#### (Linked List)

* https://github.com/AdamN8142/Linked-List-


(Application we built using vanilla javascript. the aim of this application is to keep track of your bookmark links We also used event delegation. )

(
Good work on having more commits
Would focus on making more detailed commit messages and more branches for each feature
Good work matching the comp on the desktop view
Make sure to add the class of read on the whole idea card to match the spec
A few wonky things with mobile view where things don't stay centered and the cards don't get moved down
Experiment using aria labels for inputs and buttons inside of form
Potentially try adding a few clearer roles on sections
Make sure everything is properly indented in the HTML (was mostly consistent)
Good organization of styles and alphabetizing properties
Be consistent with tabbing in properties for each class
Also add spacing between classes for developer empathy
Good use of grouping styles ( still more places where we can group similar styles or use classes in multiple places)
Good work organizing global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
Be consistent with styling of javascript and tabbing correctly (take a look at the styleguide)
Good use of event delegation
Good work breaking out functions into smaller functions and reusing them
Good naming on your functions
Some global variables, like the counters, could potentially be scoped locally (either declaring them in functions or grabbing the value from the DOM))


Functional Expectations:

Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.

Feedback to me:
("I really think we made a great team! I learned a lot from working with you and i appreciate your patience with me, especially in regard to github. Coming into the project i felt a little uneasy on a lot of the JS topics, but you coached me through them and i think  by the end of the project we both had a strong grasp on all the phases. It's hard for me to give coaching feedback with this project because we never really butt heads. The DTR was followed and whenever i reached out to you, you responded quickly. We both had the same goals for this project and the mod. Keep doing what you're doing!")

#### (Idea-Box)

Evaluator: Louisa
Notes/What To Work On:

Functional Expectations
Novice Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.
Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.

feedback for me:
("You did a great job of engaging me throughout the project to make sure I fully understood what we were coding. Throughout the pairing, there were a few inconsistencies where we agreed on a certain time and the task was postponed ranging from anywhere from a couple minutes to even sometimes an hour.  I was later informed about your situation on why there was some inconsistencies at the end of the project, and I believe if it was stated in the beginning of the project it would have made the process smoother by getting an understanding")

#### (2DoBox-Pivot)

 https://github.com/chris023/2-do-box

Don't work off master branch!
Nice descriptive commit messages.
Create lots more branches and commits!
Add more spacing between inputs
The inputs overlap into the lower section as the screen gets smaller
Clean html structure and good use of aria labels
Make sure aria labels are spelled correctly and are in opening html tag
Might move the h1 out of the form part
Make sure you refactor css styles
Good organization and alphabetizing properties
Group styles that have similar styles (like flex)
Some red flags with percentages on texts or display inline-block on inline block elements
Nice work with no global variables
Nice work keeping functions short
Might experiment using array prototypes over for loops
Instead of hiding each element, try removing them as you search
Might try storing all of your 2dos inside of an array under one key in local storage instead of individually
Good start keeping track of which quality is being stored in the constructor function under state
Instead of having multiple if/else statements checking if the state is a value, try having a local variable with an array of all of the qualities. Then you can keep track of the indexValue in the constructor function. Then when a user clicks up or down, the index bumps up or down respectively.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)

I am always willing to help other students. I encourage and always tried to maintain a positive attitude with everyone.  I am a member of several groups and make time to attend gatherings.
