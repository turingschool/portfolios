# Tim Garrity - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

To learn coding. I have been asked this question several times and people seem to be expecting a more specific answer. The straight and simple is that I came to this school to learn a skillset that would allow me to make a lot of money. I think once I learn more about coding I will develop more preferences.
