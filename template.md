# Brian Tiedt - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
*A greater understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. I wanted to get a good foundation on codeing, really wanted to learn how to write and read code.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects consisted of Number Guesser and the 3 Static Comps.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bmtiedt/bmtiedt-bt-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, you’ll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Don’t worry, we’ll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer’s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

#### Static-Comp-2

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### (Linked-List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/andrew-t-james/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

In it’s simplest form, the application should have the following:
Two input fields
One for the title of the bookmark
One for the URL that the bookmark should link to
One button for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page
A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display:
The title of the bookmark
The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL)
A button to “Mark as Read”
A button to “Remove” the bookmark

#### (Idea-Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TwirlingGoddess/BoxIdea)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Do you remember that project IdeaBox?…

We thought they were pretty great, but, we think it’s time to pivot those projects over to something we like to call 2DoBox.

You will be inheriting someone’s previous IdeaBox and pivoting it over to 2DoBox.


## Students: Arram and Brian T
## Evaluator: David Whitaker
## Notes/What To Work On:

* Great constructor function name 
* Pull shared css blocks into more broad class rules
* Think about leveraging one function to combine functions that look identical
* Make sure that tabs are set to 2 spaces for consistency
* Work on js naming conventions - if its an id string call it id

### Gear Up
#### (Health and Wellness)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

This was a very useful tool for me. This time here is very challenging and keeping a stess levels at a reasobable level is key. This is not a tool I have employed before and have found it to be very relevant.

#### (Working Styles)

This gear up gave me a better understanding of how I facilitate a better more well rounded experience here at Turing.

#### (Code Debugging The Gender Gap)

In this Gear Up we discussed the inclusion of all people. Diversity in the industry is the only way to include products and services that can helpeveryone.

#### (Mod 4 Lead)

Being Mindful of yourself, taking care for yourself. Time at Turing can provide long hours of inactivity and it's important for mental and phyical health to br mindful of those needs.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

As a Mod1 student I was able to contribute to helping keep the kitchen and common areas clean. I was helpful to those students that needed some direction. Participation was a big part of my time at Turing.
