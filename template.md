## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1803-b/1module/jungle_beats/Richard_RosaSerrano.md)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat)

(We needed to make a linked list that is supposed to make drum sounds.)

(Commit at pace OR in working chunks
All functionality should be tested, i.e. Node's next pointer can be set
Assert_instance_of shouldn't be used too often
Append shouldn't overwrite head
Indentation issues
Append needs to first check if @head is nil)

(For this project we)

(Make sure you're following the interaction pattern. We want to be able to specify the file names.
Try to keep expected and actual correct
Good job ordering tests by complexity
Try to do some edge case testing such as empty files
Every method should be tested, even the helper methods.
Lots of Integration tests but not enough Unit Tests)

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL]()

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)
### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL](Week 1: Health & Wellness)

I learned great tips on how to take care of myself and brush up on mindfulness, I need to take better care of myself than how I did during week one with not sleeping very much
### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL](Week 3: Code: Debugging the Gender Gap)

I learned how women can be underrepresented in tech and how certain technologies we have, affect those who are left out
### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL](Week 5 choice session)

This one was my favorite talk, because I learned how many companies have their privacy policies hidden or hard to find, and taking the time out to actually read what it says is shocking because they use your information in ways you wouldn't have imagined.
