## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual projects this mod were Number Guesser and three static composition challenges.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/brandido/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment] http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.  The application generates a random number in the range and gives feedback based on if the user guess is too high, too low or correct.

[Evaluation] (https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1804/mod-1/number-guesser/brandon-cunningham.md)

#### Static Comp Challenges

I was given a series of three static compositions and asked to recreate them with a responsive design while respecting the integrity of the original design. The creative license included copy, images, icons and color palette.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

My paired projects this mod were LinkedList, IdeaBox and 2DoBox.

#### LinkedList

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/brandonfiebiger/linked-list)
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

Description: Build an application in which a user can input and bookmark a webpage title and URL. Each bookmark should have a "mark to read" button and remove button and user should be able to see a count of all the bookmarks and all the read bookmarks.

Evaluation:

Feedback to me:  I appreciated your company and your insight in Javascript. I feel that in this school it would be important for any student to dive right in the code. Planning is good to a degree, but maybe one feature at a time. Overall it was a pleasure getting to know you a bit better.


Description: Build an application for recording and archiving ideas. The user should input and store an idea and description and be able to search through, edit, delete and change the quality of each idea. This project focused on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface by ensuring that the ideas persist on page load.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL] [https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1804/mod-1/idea-box/brandonc-tomk.md]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html]()

Feedback to me: I really appreciate you reminding me that it's okay to take a break. Walking through every detail was very helpful, and I am glad you took that time with me. Solid choices on the soft border edges! Also appreciate the stairs :) The reps you were taking with CSS training really showed, I think the best way to take your skills further in CSS and JavaScript is to get more reps in every day. 



#### 2doBox-Pivot

* [https://github.com/benjaminpaige/2DoBox-Pivot]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html]()

Description: Inherit another groups IdeaBox, refactor CSS/jQuery and pivot the application from a list of ideas to a task list manager.

Feedback to me:  Thank you for all your hard work and communication. You definitely helped me to see the code in smaller pieces and you were always available and excited to get this project further. You were always willing to be flexible with scheduling, but I wish we could have gotten together once or twice during the three day weekend to get things rolling sooner. I know that you had a lot of personal and health issues this mod and I hope that you have gotten to a better place now. You really are very understanding and always willing to make accommodations for any issues that came up and were an amazing partner to work with, and overall I think we produced a great final result.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Mental Health 101

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

This was a very appropriate session to learn more about stress. Turing is stressful for everyone in their own way and in my case that certainly applied. During the middle of Mod 1 I had some unexpected stress occur and it helped to remember some of the technqiues from this session.  Moving forward I need to continue to be both aware and consistent in taking down time to meditate and exercise. 


#### Code Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

I believe this was an important session and enjoyed discussing and listening to different perspectives from my classmates and mod 3 students. The video we watched increased my awareness of the gender gap amongst programmers and the tech/science community at large. I think it will be important to always try to be empathetic to others that come from different backgrounds, genders and ethnicities than my own while also being mindfull of always respecting their abilities and contributions as professionals.

#### Mental Health Apps

This was a great session for me as a had a passion project a few years ago to create a mental health related app to guide people with finding their purpose.  It a very open and honest session, particulary with the leadership from the Mod 4 students talking about a difficult but important subject.  It was very exciting to dig into what apps were out there and then come up with improvement/alternatives that could be built with software skills acquired from Turing! 


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

A big part of why I came to Turing was to interact with the community.  As a Mod 1 student I got to know many of my classmates very well in a short time and really enjoyed getting to know some of the students from the upper mods and backend program as well.  Additionally, my interaction with the instructors from my class as well as the other mods was engaging and meaningful.  While not participating in formal community roles, I believe consistently trying to connect with and engage with fellow community members in a positive way and emphasize really listening is what I have mostly contributed thus far and plan to continue doing so.
