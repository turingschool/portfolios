# Kailin Cannon - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to learn more React best practices, to learn Redux, and get better at testing.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I struggle with individual projects, but each time I did these I feel like I came up with better strategies for myself for the future. These projects were both really fun, I wish I could've spent more time on them and I hope I continue to go back to them and refactor/add cool extensions.

#### SWapiBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/SWapiBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

A fun use of the Star Wars API, the project focused on getting comfortable making nested fetch calls and cleaning data to pass it along and be displayed on the site.

#### Ghibli Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/Ghibli-Box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)


Utilizing the Studio Ghibli API, I practiced my Redux expertise and brought in Sagas and Redux selectors for the first time. I focused on making as few calls as possible to my API, instead relying on looking to my Redux store to connect different data points into arrays of clean objects which I then displayed to the page.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects this inning were HeadCount and Movie-Tracker, the latter of which I really enjoyed. I think Movie-Tracker was my best group project so far at Turing. Even though it was slower, we focused on doing all of the major parts of the project together so that we all had a really good understanding of what was going on, and I think that helped a ton. 

#### HeadCount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

This was our second-ever React project, that focused on working with an API and displaying data in useful ways for comparison.

To be honest, this was my least favorite project in mod3. The data was not only confusing, but sort of bland and the front-end wasn't very design heavy. The most enjoyable part was the people I got to work with.

#### Movie-Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/skenne21/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

MovieTracker used themoviedb's api to fetch the most recent movies and display them. Users could sign in, favorite movies, and view their list of favorites. We used a postgres backend to authenticate users and put/get data.

## D: Professional Skills

I'm glad Turing really pushes for professional development, but I feel like in the middle of massive projects that I had less time than during any other mod to really focus on that aspect. I really hope I can get back up to speed with this in Mod4.

### Gear Up

### Microaggressions
#### https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod3_Week1_Microaggressions_update.md

This was a harder gear-up to get valuable takeaways from as I believe that microaggressions are only something that happen if you let them. But I think I learned that even when I'm charging in and speaking up for someone as an ally, I'm not paying enough attention to their needs in the moment in my haste to shutdown a microagressor. In being an ally for other people, I understand now that I should make sure that they want me to say something (either in that moment or later) before I step in. 


### Group Think
#### https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Rotation_Session_Groupthink.md

This was an interesting session that I think everyone in Turing can relate to, because Turing itself is a groupthink, which I brought up as an example during the session. When you're in the middle of the space where a groupthink is happening, it's very hard to recognize the pitfalls. 

### Mod 4 Lead
#### https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xVlmU6mXCUMJGy0qcjRufEusr9ktbtRWO72K8nkewNY/edit#gid=393922023

I attended Tech in Medicine because I have a heavy interest in the ethical side of the questions that come with future tech advancements in medicine. I thought the TED talk we watched was very good, and people who have previously worked in the medical industry had good insights during the group discussion.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I attended the Demo Competition and had the pleasure of watching my former classmate Melissa win it big! It was a great night all around. I'm not keen on participating in demos unless I'm sitting on a gold mine, and I have yet to strike gold yet...but I hope my capstone in mod4 can wow people.
