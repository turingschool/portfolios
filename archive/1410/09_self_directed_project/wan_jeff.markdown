### FlyAwayFromHere

### Pitch

flight aggregator with map user interface. Aggregates data and allows you to scrape
prices. Shows routes based on price and popularity. You can then scrape for those
prices. The front-end is a map javascript interface

### Problem

The flight scrapers are currently airline or booker specific. I want to aggregate
that data, display it, so that people can make decisions on where they can travel cheaply.
People also don't know where they can fly for cheap (iceland for
example) and don't know how expensive it is to fly currently (prices ebb and flow)
How can I travel to a destination and know that it's relatively a good deal based on
historical price data?

For example, say I'm a new Yorker who wants to go to Japan. But Japan flights are currently
$1200. Is that a good deal or can I wait until a later point in the year? Or can I scrape
sites for last minute ticket deals?

### Solution

The map interface allows you to see popular flight routes based on price and
popularity, or historical cheapness. You can set alerts to be notified when there
are tickets available at that price point.

### Target Audience

Middle class or lower-income people who want to enjoy life and take a trip.
