### BusHome

### Pitch

The Personal RTD Assistant sends you text messages based on your desire departure
time telling you when to go out for the bus.

### Problem

Nothing is worse than just missing a bus. Almost as bad is getting to the bus
stop 20 mins early in the rain. When there are multiple buses taking you to the
same place, which is better to take?

### Solution

A user can send a text to their provided number with their desired departure
time, where they are, and where they are going and recieve a text telling them
when to go outside to catch the bus

### Target Audience

Denver bus riders.
