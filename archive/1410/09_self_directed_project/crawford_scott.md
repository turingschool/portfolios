### Monthly Music Mood

### Pitch

This allows a user to look back at the music that defined their life for a period of time.

### Problem

Often times I find myself going through different 'music seasons'. I will listen to a group of songs a lot for a little while and then forget about them. This allows me to remember what those songs were that had my attention for that short period of time and take me back to that part time of my life.

### Solution

I will pull in a users data from spotify and generate playlists based on the top played songs for that particular month. Then I will take those top songs from the month and analyze the lyrics and genre to determine the mood of the playlist.

### Target Audience

The target audience would be people who listen to music most likely in the age range of 16 - 30.
