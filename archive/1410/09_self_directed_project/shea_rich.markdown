### Rails Trail

A job trender app that identifies locations around the country that have the most Ruby on Rails jobs as well as the areas that are showing the most growth in those jobs.

### Problem

Difficult to see big picture trends on where specific jobs are located and where they might be headed.

### Solution

Rails Trail will aggregrate all of the Ruby on Rails jobs from Indeed.com and organize the quantitative data into a table (eventually a heatmap). Each day's data will be stored so that it can then be organized into monthly tables to show the job amount increases/decreases in each location.
A registered user can create an account and receive daily text/emails of jobs in their selected region.

### Target Audience

Ruby on Rails jobseekers
