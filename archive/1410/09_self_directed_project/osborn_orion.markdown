### PlanToMeet

### Pitch

A tool that recommends meetup events to you by text and/or email
based on a number of factors including interests, location and
possibly availability.

### Problem

Often times we're too busy to search out the fun and interesting
things happening all arount us.  We often want to be more social,
but without the time and energy to spend finding events/meetups,
we go home and settle into our normal routine.

### Solution

We can use meetup.com api's and other information such as location
to notify you by text and/or email about all the fun things happening
all around you.  Our goal is to help you experience new things and
connect you with people you might not otherwise connect with.
Identifying the best meetup to send to user is an interesting problem
to solve.

### Target Audience

This app will be useful for people wanting to be social and spontaneous,
while connecting with people who have similar interests.

### Integrations

* Meetup.com
* Google Calendar API
