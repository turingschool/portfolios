### Food Baby

### Pitch

An app that quickly identifies family-friendly restaurants, whether you want to take your kids there, or avoid them entirely.

### Problem

Your child is a bit fussy and you’re hungry. How can you find a restaurant where people won’t give you the stink-eye if a minor temper-tantrum erupts?

or, the reverse

You and your spouse finally get a night out! You want to find a restaurant without high chairs, flinging food, that has a completely adult atmosphere.

### Solution

An app for parents to quickly identify kid-friendly restaurants. Or, the opposite: an app for adults to quickly identify restaurants where children are banned.

### Target Audience

This app is targeted at hungry adults, either with or without children.
