### RiderDemand

### Pitch

RiderDemand allows Uber drivers (partners) the ability to see which areas in their current city are "hot" based on events and other data. The app also lets them see what areas are light in supply to maximize their chances of finding the most customers, closest to them.

### Problem

As an Uber driver myself, I find I'm constantly looking at Uber's rider app trying to see where other drivers are in relation to me. Finding an area of high demand and light supply is essential to making the most of my short hours of driving. Uber does not currently provide the information and data to make this analysis possible. RiderDemand is here to change that.

### Solution

RiderDemand will pull in event and occurences data as well as reveal areas of low supply (underserved markets) on a map to show drivers where they should position themselves. Notifications can also be sent to the driver's phone letting them know what areas are "hot".

### Target Audience

Uber drivers in select cities
