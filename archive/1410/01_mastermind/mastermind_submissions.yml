      1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
      Score: 3
      Keep indentation correct
      Guess checker was nice
      methods that do things should imply this in their names

      2. Enumerable & Collections
      Score: 3
      Good use of enumerables, but still a few you could look for when you find yourself doing logic across a collection

      Score: 2

      4. REPL Interface
      Score: 4

      5. Breaking Logic into Components
      Score: 2.5
      toplevel puts
      Fix input where it comes in, not where used
      Don't let lower level components know where they fall in a higher level process
      Avoid duplicate logic (e.g. determining invalid guess and creating a message based on it)

      1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
      Score: 3
      folder names should be lowercase
      class and method names are good

      2. Enumerable & Collections
      Score: 2
      Adequate enumerables

      3. Test-Driven Development
      Score: 1
      Guess tests failing
      Printer tests failing
      Game tests useless

      4. REPL Interface
      Score: 4
      increments guess on invalid guesses
      invalid input "xxxx" is indicated in a different way than other invalid messages

      gemified (
        nice, but read:
          http://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/ -- esp look at the directory structure -- there's stuff we didn't teach you
        and check out https://github.com/JoshCheek/seeing_is_believing/blob/6c05906b6484a9a47902793b8bc3743db101d620/seeing_is_believing.gemspec#L20
          to see how to fix $LOAD_PATH for people who use the gem
      )
      make sure methods are defined in the class, not on Object
      careful when sharing objects (don't modify them)

      2. Enumerable & Collections
      Score: 3
      Accomplished what was needed
      Probably there are enumerables that would make this easier (e.g. count, select, stuff like that)

      3. Test-Driven Development
      Score: 2
      Cli isn't covered
      Game could use more coverage

      4. REPL Interface

      colours / table
      works correctly

      bin in bin dir
      Like the DIFFICULTY_MAP
      watch indentation
      generally good
      some misspellings

      2. Enumerable & Collections
      Score: 4
      Good use of zip and count
      Nice use of String#count

      3. Test-Driven Development
      Score: 1
      Missing tests on Cli and Game
      Logic in game would be easy to test if extracted from Game, or if CLIness (loop, gets, puts) was pulled out of game and up into CLI

      4. REPL Interface
      Score: 2.5
      Can enter menu options at any point
      Prompts not always displayed when input is expected
      A little whitespace would go a long way

      5. Breaking Logic into Components
      Score: 2.5
      Some good choices, like pulling difficulty into CLI, letting SequenceGenerator take whatever
      Tests suffered as a consequence of game logic being integrated in the same object (Game) with cli decisions (mentioned earlier)

      1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
      Score: 2
      Keep indentation correct (would alert you to having closed the class and defining methods on Object)
      Good fixing the load path
      Use names that allow you to understand what it does (e.g. ColorChecker instead of GuessChecker1)
      Work on choosing names that let you know how to use (what it does) it purely based on its name

      2. Enumerable & Collections
      Score: 1
      Hard-coding against indexes instead of using enumerables

      3. Test-Driven Development
      Score: 1
      No actual tests (1 in each, all the same)

      4. REPL Interface
      Score: 2.5
      Two goodbyes
      After we got it completing, interface was decent
      With the game loop, just spend more time figuring out why it's doing what it's doing, and what needs to change to do what you want it to do

      5. Breaking Logic into Components
      Score: 3.5
      GuessChecker1 has good boundaries
      Good pulling the checkers out of Game
      Timer is a good abstraction, but doesn't work independently (once it was working, was nice to not have to deal with that info in Game)

      1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
      Score: 2
      Using require_relative instead of fixing the $LOAD_PATH
      Like the Messages class
      Delete unused code
      Nice use of String#scan
      Clean up comments from playing around (e.g. code at end of Game)
      Clean up code you're no longer using (e.g. cli.rb and guess.rb -- just delete them)

      2. Enumerable & Collections
      Score: 1.5
      Solving position_count by accessing positionally rather than iterating
      Uses enumerables to solve correct_count, but there are more useful enumerable methods in the stdlib (e.g. Enumerable#count)

      3. Test-Driven Development
      Score: 1
      Cannot run tests b/c of syntax error
      Tests start a game (thus hanging)
      Just generally missing

      4. REPL Interface
      Score: 2
      Same solution every time
      Could use whitespace better to make it clearer where we were at
      A little more attention to detail would go a long way

      5. Breaking Logic into Components
      Score: 2
      Need to pay more attention to what objects are being talked to (tests would have caught this) (specifically, sometimes talking to the output stream, sometimes to Kernel#puts)
      All of the game logic embedded into the Game (coupled to command-line), such that can't be easily tested or reused.
