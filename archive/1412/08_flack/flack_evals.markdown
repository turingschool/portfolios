### Technical Objectives

#### A. Services

* 2 - Project uses one service for some piece of the functionality

#### B. Encapsulation

* 3 - Service connections are condensed into single classes that abstract the details

#### C. Rails MVC

* 3 - Application makes efforts to push logic down from controllers into the models and processor objects

#### D. Test-Driven Development

* 1 - The code does not have 80% test coverage

### Client Satisfaction

#### A. Deployment

Is it properly deployed and ready for customers?

* 4 - VPS deployment with NGINX/Apache, PostgreSQL, and proper startup after machine reboot

#### B. Features

* 2 - Some features were sacrificed to meet the deadline

#### C. Interface

* 2 - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective

#### D. Concept

* 2 - Below expectations, this is at-best a prototype

### Project Management and Process

### A. Project Management process

* 3 - The team uses project management tools for conceptual
planning, but development is still somewhat ad-hoc and disorganized

### B. Project Management process

* 3 - The team plans project sprints effectively, but one or two sprints
end with a non-functional product

## Tino, Miriam, Paul -- Glass Basement

#### A. Services

* 2 - Project uses one service for some piece of the functionality

#### B. Encapsulation

* 2 - Some attempt is made to abstract the services from each other, but it is leaky

#### C. Rails MVC

* 3 - Application makes efforts to push logic down from controllers into the models and processor objects

#### D. Test-Driven Development

* 3 - The code demonstrates high test coverage (>80%), tests at feature and unit levels, but needs all services to be running concurrently

### Client Satisfaction

#### A. Deployment

* 1 - Not deployed

#### B. Features

* 3 - All planned features were delivered

#### C. Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality

#### D. Concept

* 3 - Met expectations, the application is a solid first version

### Project Management and Process

* 3 - The team uses project management tools for conceptual
planning, but development is still somewhat ad-hoc and disorganized

### B. Project Management process
