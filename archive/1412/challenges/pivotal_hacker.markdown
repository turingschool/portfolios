Jeff Gu
-------

1. Satisfactory Progress

  Score: 3
2. Ruby Syntax & Style

  Score: 3

  * When stuff gets complex (eg those params), figure out why, and also whether there is a way to cleanly handle it
3. Rails Style & API

  Score: 3

  * The Enum has more to offer, key insight is that you get to deal with names, not numbers
4. Testing

  Score: 3

  * Pay attention to naming (clarify your thoughts with the names)
  * With the feature ones, a more holistic usage of the behaviour wouldn't be difficult to add, but would increase your confidence considerably

1. Satisfactory Progress

  Score: 3

  * Completes base challenges
  * Looks pretty nice / pleasant to use :)
  * Board#title should be required

  Score: 4
4. Testing
  Score: 3

Kyra Steenbock
--------------

1. Satisfactory Progress

  Score: 3

  * Tickets progress, but not regress

2. Ruby Syntax & Style

  Score: 4
3. Rails Style & API

  Score: 3

  * The key insight of the enum is that you don't ever have to use the integer database representation (you know... minus that next_status thing we made >.<)
4. Testing

  Score: 3

  * Use `create!` to immediately fail the test if it doesn't save (errors that tell you where the real problem is)
  * Guard against other ways that the test could unintentionally pass
