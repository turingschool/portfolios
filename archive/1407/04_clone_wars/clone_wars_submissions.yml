      notes: "all base expectations fulfilled; added one interactive element.
              admin menu able to be edited w/o being logged in as administrator.
              some acceptance tests (creating user, creating menu items), but unit tests missing.
              used all http verbs; some mixing of web & business logic.
              views used layouts and partials to avoid code replication.
              many concerns about order of lessons and lack of important concepts in lessons."

      notes: "recreated original site; added banner, contact, reservation, and reviews.
              admin able to edit items (name, size, price, image).
              saw good testing at feature level; would like to see more things tested in isolation.
              good divisions of logic and encapsulation; content store probably could  have been broken into a repository and a seracher.
              easy to read and follow code.
              saw use of layout and partials to avoid code duplication; did not see use of helpers.

    instructor_evaluation:
      notes: "several routes that do not work (missing template, error pages).
              content on pages well-tested; missing tests for user authentication and ability to edit.
              started classes for menu and menu item, but not implemented.
              would like to see controller not as responsible for executing DB commands and raw sql.
              app crashed during execution, but code showed effort toward organization and refactoring.
              web and business logic mixed, but used features of Sinatra (Rack::Session, setting variables based on ENV); used helpers to authenticate user
              views contain minimal logic; make use of layout and partials; did not see built-in view helpers.
