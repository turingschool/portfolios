## Notes

* Put together a few components today
* Not a lot of code that runs

## Scores

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together
