### Evaluations

#### Marla, Lovisa, Dmitry

GitHub: http://github.com/marlabrizel/the_pivot<br>
Production: http://codestarter.herokuapp.com

* **Completion**: 2: Team completed most of the user stories and requirements set by the client.
* **Organization**: 4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* **Test-Driven Development**: 4: Code coverage was good on both unit and integration level
* **Code Quality**: 3: Quality was high overall, but still had more logic in the controller than I would have liked
* **User Experience**: 4: Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.

#### Tyler, Jai, Mike, Michael

GitHub: http://github.com/mrjaimisra/the_pivot<br>
Production: http://imagine-take2.herokuapp.com

* **Completion**: 3: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
* **Organization**: 4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* **Test-Driven Development**: 4: Coverage was good, showed understanding at all levels.
* **Code Quality**: 3.5: Code was better factored than most, controllers were mostly skinny, wouldn't call it "Exceptional" though.
* **User Experience**: 4: Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.

#### Jack, Adam, Dave

GitHub: http://github.com/adamcaron/the_pivot<br>
Production: http://way-out-there.herokuapp.com

* **Completion**: 1: Team completed the user stories and requirements partially.
* **Organization**: 2: Team used a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently.
* **Test-Driven Development**: 1: Code coverage was below 70%
* **Code Quality**: 3: What code was there was excellent, but it was clear that there were large gaps due to the missing stories. Their cart in particular had almost no code. I wouldn't feel comfortable giving a higher grade with so many potential code monsters left unexplored.
* **User Experience**: 2: Project exhibits some gaps in the UX.

#### Sebastian, Max, Alex

GitHub: http://github.com/MaxMillington/the_pivot<br>
Production: http://collectors-world.herokuapp.com

* **Completion**: 3: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
* **Organization**: 4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* **Test-Driven Development**: 4: Code coverage was fine in SimpleCov, there were clearly tests that didn't actually excercise the edge cases. It's an iffy 4, but I do still feel like they understand the concepts expected.
* **Code Quality**: 3: Emails being sent from user model, models too fat overall, controllers has more logic than I would have liked. Overall quality was pretty good, but I wouldn't call it exceptionally well factored.
* **User Experience**: 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
