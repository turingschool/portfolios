## Notes

* encrypt and decrypt should work, no crack
* lots of code, mostly 90% effective and compounds with combinations

## Code

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
