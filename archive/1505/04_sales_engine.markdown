Assessment Notes:


1. Functional Expectations
4: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions
3: Application fulfills all base expectations as tested by the spec harness
2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes
1: Application crashes during normal usage

2. Test-Driven Development
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
1: Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

5. Enumerable & Collections
4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
1: Application demonstrates deficiencies with Enumerable and struggles with collections
