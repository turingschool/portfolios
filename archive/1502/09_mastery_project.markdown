### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.

Completed stated goal to pull real-time flight options in a timely manner

**2. Organization**

* 3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

Default to 3 didn't really talk about it or focus on it.

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 3: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).

Pretty good testing on rails level, including connections to external APIs

**2. Code Quality**

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

Good:

* use of ruby service objects to abstract job of interacting with external APIs
* Pretty effective at applying angular organization patterns for Services in UI layer
* ruby layer testing seems ok

Bad:

* General sloppyness around code "tidyness" -- comments hanging around, unused files and templates,
trailing whitespace, exposed API keys, etc etc
* Angular side feels a little brittle in terms of ability to move things around; points to
somewhat weak understanding of what each piece is doing in that portion of the application

### Product Experience

**1. User Experience**

* 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

UX is solid; flow is very simple so we only have a couple pages. Would be helpful
to have more things clearly labeled in the UI especially when viewing flight results.

Also all the type is enormous.

**2. Performance**

* 3: Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

## David Daniel

* ambitious project spec
* Intended to make a websocket game using canvas 
* got sick during the project; lost time to that and to job interview assignments

Main issue seems to be inability to complete functioning small iteration before
tackling additional problems.

Ended up partially attacking a lot of fairly difficult portions (game logic, infinite boards,
websocket/real-time updating, drag and drop, canvas rendering, etc). Would have been better
to focus on smaller portions and get them done.

Additionally might have helped to focus on completing the bigger picture without as many
details (e.g., get some crude version of the game working but without implementing all scrabble
rules and restrictions.)
