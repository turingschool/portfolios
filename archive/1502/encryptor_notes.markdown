  Notes:
    * Encrypt/Decrypt appear good
    * Good job with decomposition
    * Could use a little more refactoring to break functionality out of "runners"

Kenny:

  Notes:
    * Put your implementation in `./lib`
    * Implementation code could use a little bit of refactoring / simplification
    * Good use of integration tests
    * Good decomposition

Jack:

  Notes:
    * Has encrypt/decrypt components but no way to read/write files from terminal
    * Need to have Rakefile to run all tests
    * Some duplication in implementation code (extract small classes)
    * Now need to implement File I/O
