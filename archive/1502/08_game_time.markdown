## Michelle Golle and Tom Leskin

### Notes

* Game is decently playable. Some unpredictability of the speed unless you refresh.
* You can shoot ducks
* Used Canvas for moving the duck around
* 15 tests that all pass
* Decided to improve code rather than build more features
* JS implementation looks pretty clean
* Look for opportunities to push functionality out of your "god object" into the children -- out from index.js into other files.

* Weren't able to test, get jQuery going
* Used kind of a temporary file testing because of require problems
* Some git confusion about a few tests

### Notes

* Game is basically playable, missing shape rotation but lines can be cleared
and the game can be lost.
* Got into OOP late
* 26 tests that pass, though the execution is a little haphazard
* Realized that board should have been a class, kept digging the ditch deeper
* Try pulling magic data out to a config object
