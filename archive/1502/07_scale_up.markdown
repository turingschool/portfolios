## Lori Culberson

### Notes

* User perspective: pages feel slow, pagination on the past orders and tickets,
* Performance: no caching, some query optimization with includes and size vs count
* Suggest get together with a group to dive deeper into the backend stuff

* Load Testing: 3, doesn't crash, some decent coverage
* Database Load: Y, good data
* Performance: 2, some good work with with includes and count/vs/size
* Additional Features: 3, pagination and AWS removed

## Mihir Parikh
