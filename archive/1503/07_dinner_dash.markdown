1. Feature Completeness
  * 3: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented

2. Views
  * 3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through

3. Controllers
  * 4: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack

4. Models
  * 4: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features

5. Testing
  * 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels

6. Usability
  * 3: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before itâ€™d be customer-ready

7. Workflow
  * 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.
  
Notes: A solid project. The models looked great and had a solid test suite. One task I requested to be complete was not ready for the final evaluation. I had requested they not access hashes from the views and explained how to resolve. When we met they had done the work on the back end, but failed to make use of the solution in the view. The group had the talent to have completed more features, but seemed to suffer from not focusing and seemed exhausted by the end. Seemed like Sally was leading the project but ran out of energy at the end.
