### Brett, Sally, Josh -- Team Clojure

Great job working through a fairly complicated project in a
new language and environment. Appreciate your hard work
experimenting with a lot of technical unknowns.

Use of clojurescript and websocket connections is pretty idiomatic,
and you did a good job of working with reagent to construct the frontend.

* Features - 2
* Interface - 3
* Project Management - 3
* Code quality - 3
* Style / Use of ecosystem and libraries - 4
* Language experimentation / technical learning - 4
* Deployment - 4 - got it on heroku
* TDD - 2

### Justin, Margarett, Morgan

Great exploration of some interesting SOA and use of React for
some front-end management. Didn't get far into the product / concept
aspects of the project, but it seems like we got some interesting technical
learning along the way.

Glad to see we got a lot of practice with JS both on the server and the client
side. Major bonus points for the React frontend. Sounds like Margarett got
pretty close to a working implementation of a canvas / live-drawing system, but
just didn't quite get it put together at the end.

* Services - 4
* Encapsulation 3
* Rails MVC - 3
* TDD - 3
* Concept - 2 - mostly just vanilla chat app at this point
* Deployment - 2 - attempted to deploy on heroku but hit some snags with node side
* Features - 3 - multi channel, auth
* Technical learning / experimentation - 4 -- lots of node and react usage
* Project Management - 3

### Drew and Max

* Testing seems great
* Pretty successful effort working with multi-application architecture
and managing data flow through the various pieces
* Chat ui is pretty nice although basic UI of the rest of the app suffers
* Didn't get too deep into the theming / product aspects of the project
* Supporting multi channels successfully is cool
* Took a stab at deploying but need to figure out env variable management
* Got lots of practice with node
* interesting use of rails-side rendering to distribute html partials to chat participants

* Services - 4

* Concept - 2
* Deployment - 2
* Features - 3; got basic auth and standard chat setup with multi rooms; next steps would have
been to push this further
