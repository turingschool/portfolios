### Whitney/Sally

__Instructor:__ Horace

__Repo:__ https://github.com/sallymacnicholas/game_time

* UI is awesome and colorful; animations and user feedback are very
helpful; some of them could be sped up a tad
* Feature set is good; game feels complete, can play different cards, etc
* Testing is pretty solid and thorough at covering different game scenarios
* Testing could eventually get pruned a bit, but we're starting from a good
position of covering the scenarios, so that is good
* Game structure takes a solid OO approach
* Some opportunities remain for refactoring and reducing duplication
* Keep working on pushing Jquery out of the main game logic

### Max / Vanessa

__Instructor:__ Horace

__Repo:__ https://github.com/vanegomez/lights_out 

* Game UI is fun and useable; fancy use of css
* Testing super thorough; seems to cover all cases
in the small as well as the large
* Firm application of OO style
* Rendering logic encapsulated by each game component
* Pretty good job of keeping jquery out of most of the code
(isolating it to the rendering stuff)
* Super solid application of OO JS style

### Margarett / Justin

__Instructor:__ Horace

__Repo:__ https://github.com/Justin-Holmes/Tron

* Game is sweet; awesome interface and playability
* testing is thorough and incremental
* Game rendering could be more isolated from play / data logic (imagine
2 phases -- move, then render)
* some opportunities to use JS objects as maps to clean up some branching
and looping complexity

### Brett / Morgan

__Instructor:__ Horace

__Repo:__ https://github.com/morganmiller/snake.git

* Game is sweet; ui is cool and artisanally hand-crafted with
nice pixels
* Testing is very light; misses the opportunity to really get into
the more interesting game logic stuff -- collisions, updating the game
data, etc
* Structure is making strides toward an interesting functional approach;
still leaving too much stuff in the initial doc ready callback
* Desired benefit of this functional approach is that it becomes easier to test
because every function is clean input/output

### Drew / Josh

__Instructor:__ Horace

__Repo:__ https://github.com/NYDrewReynolds/snake

* Solid snake app with some cool features
* Good application of OO JS style
* Testing needs some work - really a symbiotic problem between code and test;
too many things relying on DOM/canvas
* Might be interesting to experiment with a totally separate renderer
function or object which slurped those things out of the other objects
