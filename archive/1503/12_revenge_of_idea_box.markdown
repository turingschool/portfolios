* I really liked the user interface. Clean and simple to use.
* I would really be nice to see some of your html in partials.

Liked that you used FactoryGirl for tests.
Liked that you did the form validation with the alert
Liked that you specified the title and body for the keyup filter

Would have been nice to figure out respond_with rather than respond_to
Index action creates an @ideas variable AND an @idea variable

JS looked great! Nice partials! Could have finished more features.

Comments Nice use of js.erb, really clean code - skinny controller, clean view, good use of partials, really like the way you handled the thumbs up/thumbs down with a get/remote: true ... so clever.

Love the artisanal handcrafted styling without a framework.

Rendered random text as http responses. Status code would have been more helpful.```

1. Features -- 3: All of the base expectations were met

2. User Interface -- 4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use

3. Testing -- 3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

4. Rails Style -- 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and push business logic down where it belongs

5. Ruby Style -- 4: Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored

6. JavaScript Style -- 4: Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored

Comments:

Liked how your files and code were well-organized -- JS code was all in one file, but very easy to read and understand.
Liked your use of respond_with and ajax calls -- site was responsive and quick.

Improvements:

Would have liked to see a before_action in controller -- replacing all the Idea.find(params[:id])

Tests have excellent coverage of edge cases for model tests. Tests are clear and easy to understand. Feature tests could cover more user interface.
JS code is clean and easy to read. Callbacks could be extracted into separate functions. Responsibilities of each function are clear and intuitive.
Excellent code quality, code is very clear, concise, and clean across the board. I like your use of rails helper methods and gems. App is very easy for users to navigate and the interface is very intuitive.
