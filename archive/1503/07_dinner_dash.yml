  Repo: "https://github.com/morganmiller/dinner_dash"
  Feature Completeness: "3: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented"
  Views: "4: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present"
  Controllers: "3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts"
  Models: "3.5"
  Testing: "4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels"
  Usability: "3: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before itâ€™d be customer-ready"
  Workflow: "4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool."

  Repo: https://github.com/kravinskylev/dinner_dash
  Feature Completeness: ~3
  Views: 2 - could benefit from more partials and organization here
  Controllers: 3 - controllers are pretty tidy
  Models: 3 - models are well organized and sufficient, but not incredibly sophisticated
  Testing: 3 - test coverage is quite thorough, especially at the feature level; would like to see more unit testing, but this is still probabl the strongest part of the app
  Usability: 1 - app needs a lot of work on interface
  Workflow: 2 - sounds like a lot of communication issues along the way
