2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Javascript Fundamentals
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

1. Functional Expectations
4: Application fulfills all base expectations as well as 1 or more of the remove_by/find_by index/value functions

2. Test-Driven Development
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

4. Javascript Fundamentals
4: Application makes excellent use of JS techniques, including fluid and consistent manipulation of Objects and Functions

5. Looping or Recursion
4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques

__Comments__

Liked that you used Object.prototype to define your methods. Your loops were effective and your functions were easy
to understand. I also liked that you build your methods in a way that you could call them in other places and make
use of each other to accomplish your objective. I used recursion, so it was nice to see an iterative implementation.
Nicely done!

Some of the functions were pretty long, but they were written out in a way that they were easy to understand, so not
a huge deal. There may be an opportunity to refactor some of the longer functions into smaller ones to help out
with isolation, but again, not a huge deal. Most of the functions are clear and concise.

(1) Functional expectations: 3
(2) Test-Driven Development: 4 (nice use of "pizza" variables)
(3) Encapsulation: 4 (good refactoring, makes use of method calls like .findTail())
(4) JS Fundamentals: 4
(5) Looping: 4

__Comments__
Code very compact and well divided for each object model. It's easy to look at each method and understand what your code does. Excellent use of recursion. Tests are clear and straight-forward. I like that you called methods that you had already written from within other methods.
Naming is a little ambigious.

Project was broken up very well into different functions. They were well named and easy to follow. Justin also wrote his own tests that covered all aspects of a linked list.
