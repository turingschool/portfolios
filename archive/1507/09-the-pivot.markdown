Notes:

* While the scores below seem to imply a weak project, the scores were a result of taking risks and challenging skill level. The team's skills are better as a result and this should be taken into account during portfolio reviews.
* Pushing boundries of comfort level with jQuery. Attempting things more complicated than the other projects I assessed.
* Styling could use more work.
* jQuery cart is a good start but the interface needs polish. Some prices are using dollars and others are using cents. Email sent is not complete.
