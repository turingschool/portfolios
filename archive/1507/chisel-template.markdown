* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.
* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 3. Functionality

* 4: Application implements all base functionality and two extensions
* 3: Application implements all base functionality
* 2: Application is missing or has issues with one component of the base expectations
* 1: Application has issues with more than one component of base expectations

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
