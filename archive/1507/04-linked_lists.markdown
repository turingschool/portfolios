## With Jeff

### Michael Wong

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/Kealii/LinkedLists.git

#### Notes

* Seemed conceptually easy but hard to get started
* Didn't quite get remove by value working
* 42 tests with two issues around remove by value
* Tests show really good spiraling of complexity

* Much simpler than BST
* Tests are trending to a good place, need a bit more with the edge cases and
some are hard to follow
* Implementation has some good code reuse, other spots where it's missing
* Missed some features because JC was slow in pushing the spec changes
