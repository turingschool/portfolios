* use more commits / smaller steps, not manual backups
* good implementation of a Cell and good tests
* able to solve many problems

1. Functional Expectations: 4, solved 40 of Horace's puzzles
2. TDD: 3, good test count and coverage
3. Encapsulation: 3, like the cell/solver split
4. Fundamental Ruby: 3, good code
5. Enumerable: 3, functional but watch out for patterns
