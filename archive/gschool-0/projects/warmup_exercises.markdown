## Warm-Up Exercise Repositories

On Mondays through Thursdays we will post a warm-up exercise at 8:50. You will have until 9:15 to complete the exercise.

Commit the code to your fork.

We'll provide feedback in-line.

If you have questions about the assignments, email Katrina at katrina@jumpstartlab.com.
