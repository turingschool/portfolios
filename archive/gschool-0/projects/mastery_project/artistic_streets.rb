  :project_description => "Uncover a new sense of place by discovering public art in your area.  This app let's people discover and document public art pieces in their area and around the world.  Goals this time around are to integrate with instagram, introduce the concept of administrators that can review submissions, create a better mobile experience (which is the primary use case), and to try and prevent duplicate and inappropriate submissions by providing functionality that will give users more ownership of the map (i.e. user can subscribe to a zipcode and get an email or text message when a new art piece has been submitted.  The notified user can then be a 'guardian' of the map by flagging duplicate or inappropriate submissions).",
