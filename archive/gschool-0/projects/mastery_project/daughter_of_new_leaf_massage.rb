There's a lot that I'm still working on, but for the next week and a half I want to focus on 1) ability to schedule a recurring appointment (e.g. every Tuesday at 10am), 2) online payments, 3) her updated appointment times (they've shifted since I built this), and 4) if there is time, a revamped admin dashboard to view her upcoming schedule.",
