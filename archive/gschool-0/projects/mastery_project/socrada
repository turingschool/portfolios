  :project_description => "There is currently no ability to visualise a 'stepping stone' map of connections to people within a social network. If I want to connect with someone outside of my immediate social network I should be able to plot the necessary connections to make in order to get a legitimate introduction. Socrada will pull in social media connections and attempt to weight the relationship value between two parties to facilitate a node graph search which will yield the most efficient route to connection.",
