  :project_description => "Automotive website providers are slow, outdated, & unreliable in their practices. In the long term, this project is an attempt at building a fully functioning automotive dealership website. For this short project, the app will complete the first phase of the platform -- an automated inventory importer tool that interfaces with Rackspace Cloud Files & Sendgrid. Rackspace Cloud Files will be used to store inventory files as it is one of the few cloud storage providers that can receive data via FTP. While there are better technologies available, the automotive industry data providers only export data to third parties via FTP. Sendgrid will be utilized to inform the necessary parties about the status of the import and whether or not action must be taken in order to retrieve updated data. At it's completion, the project will serve as the backend for a tool that can be used for sales, reporting, and analysis of an automotive dealership.",
