Specifically, it will break the text into lines of a specific number of syllables and rhyme the last words of every two lines.  Uses for this app will be entertainment/sillyness and education.  The education value will come from taking information and translating it into a more easily memorizable form...song.  Users will have the option of signing into their instagram accounts to incorporate personal photos as album artwork.",
