## Eloquent Ruby - Reading Group 2

For this exercise:

1. Edit your group's `group_x_notes.markdown` file
2. Fill in your responses
3. Submit one or more pull requests

The responses should be in thoughtful paragraphs and make use of markdown's formatting for `inline code`, **bold**/*italic*, etc.

Consider the following questions as guides to help you build a strong response:

#### Key Ideas

* If you were distilling the chapters down to one page, what would get included?
* When are the techniques useful / how do you recognize situations to use them?

#### The Highlight

* What topic made you say "OH!"?
* What will save you work in the future?
* What didn't make sense before but now clicked?

#### The Lowlight

* What's still confusing?
* Was there a subject where you understood the code but not why you'd want to use it?
* Did something stand out as particularly hackish, strange, or ugly?
