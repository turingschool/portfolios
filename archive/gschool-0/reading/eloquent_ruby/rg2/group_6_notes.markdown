## RG2 Notes for Eloquent Ruby

### Short Methods (CH10) & Operators (CH11) & Equality (CH12)

#### Key Ideas
  - Keep each class and method focused and readable. 
  - Short and focused methods are readable to humans and reusable. 
  - Single responsibility is better than multi-responsibility, or methods that do 10 things. 
  - How to create and implement operators for classes. 
  - Operators are really just methods. 
  - Differentiating the different types of equality 

#### The Highlight
  - Being able to make your own iterators- blew our minds. 
  - Keeping code clean saves later anguish when things break. 
  - Operating across classes was helpful
  - Way of representing powerful things with very simple operators, but you have to really think about how it is going to be used.
  - Operators can be easy to try to use...

#### The Lowlight
  - Not much of a lowlight specifically. 
  - Just getting comfortable with this way of writing- keeping code clean and simple.
  - But operators can be difficult in actual implementation. 
  - But operators can be difficult in actual implementation. 
  

### Singletons (CH13) & Class Instance Variables (CH14)

#### Key Ideas
  - Singleton methods can be used on a class, which is a single instance. 
  - Idea of an invisible class which is actually there- reminder that everything is an object in Ruby. 

#### The Highlight
  - Clarified why we use self., class methods.  
  - The example of the printer with the class instance variable chapter was helpful to clarify the chapter. 
  - Subclasses was well-defined in this chapter. 

#### The Lowlight
  - New idea to try to understand- singletons. 
  - Rails examples are hard to understand. 

### Modules as Namespaces (CH15) & Mixins (CH16)

#### Key Ideas
  - How to change a program on the fly. 

#### The Highlight
  - Understanding how to use mixens and modules in an effective way. 
  - How to create a module that can get mixed in across classes. 

#### The Lowlight
  - How to change a program during runtime. 

### Blocks (CH17) &  Execute Around (CH18) & Execute Later (CH19)

#### Key Ideas
  - Using blocks for recursive blocks

#### The Highlight
  - The description of the "iterator on steroids" 

#### The Lowlight
  - Blocks feel unconfortable and unnatural!
  - Still unsure about their best use.
