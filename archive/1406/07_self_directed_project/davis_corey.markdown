### Title
Skate Ways (reserving the right to change)

**SELECTED**

#### Pitch

Skate Ways uses data from http://data.opencolorado.org/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-skate-parks to help you find the skate park closest to you and allows you to see who's FourSquare checked-in there in the last three hours.

#### Description

The app will allow users to find current skate spots, and add their own. In addition users can upload images of features and rank them and describe. Foursquare checkins as well so you can see if people you know are skating. There will be a trick challenge section as well were users can upload vines of tricks on a specific feature and then rank other users tricks.

#### Target 

Anyone who skates, scoots, or trick bikes. Maybe some of those fruitbag roller bladers too, though I might try to find a way to descrimahate on them cause lame. If there is time I might try to build in something for Urban Snowboarders too, because they are more fun then the whole lot of wheelheads. AND there is NOTHING out there for them, mostly because it's illegal in most places, but meh.
