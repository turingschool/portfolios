# Walk About

**SELECTED**

#### Pitch

An app that generates a walk starting from your current position that includes historical landmarks, murals, parks and other attractions.

#### Description

What it'll do:
  - The User will choose a distance and the types of things they would like to see, e.g. Murals, Historical Landmarks, Public works of art.
  - The App will then generate a walk that will include as many of those locations as possible in the distance the User has provided.
  - It will integrate with google maps or the maps app on iphone or whatever to give directions to the user via audio if they choose.
  - There could be some gameification involved, e.g. a badge for every city, a badge for various numbers of landmarks sited, a badge for number of completed walks.  

Why it should exist:
  - It should exist because people should be able to get to know their own city and neighborhood and become exposed to history, art etc.(for free) that they may not have noticed before
  - This is also made with tourists in mind. Say I have an hour before I see a show. It's not enough time to really go and do anything. With this app they could take a walk and see landmarks close to wherever they are.]

#### Target Audience

The target application would be tourists and those who live in the city and want to find out more.
