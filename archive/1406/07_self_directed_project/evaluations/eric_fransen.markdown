#### Need to Have All

√/2 You must use an external OAuth provider to authenticate users  
√   You must filter data appropriately in both the web and API based on authorization rules
X   You must make use of a Virtual Private Server to host your application
√   Make use of background workers for all appropriate tasks
x   Send notifications to users over email/SMS/Twitter

#### Nice to Have

Try for at least one of these:

x You must automate the deployment of your application to a single command
x Your application must accept uploads of some user images
x Your application must manipulate those images to suit the layout/style of the app itself
x Receive some form of content from users via email

#### Probably Skip

x You must expose a JSON API that allows a user to both read and write data
x You must create a Ruby gem which allows a user to easily interact with your API

### Functional/Content Expectations

A good project idea should:

x break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on time
√ be something that real people would want to use and find some utility for their life
√ have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

√ In addition, your application **must make good use of one dataset or API from a public/non-profit non-partisan source such as:**
