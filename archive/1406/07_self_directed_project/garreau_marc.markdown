#### Career Crumbs v1, v2

[If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED (v#)** here]

#### Pitch

We help job seekers get to where they want to go.

#### Description

[v1] Users can search our system for a job title and find the most frequently
     used words across many related job listings. With those words, they can
     view top amazon books related to that keyword, so that they spend time
     developing skills that companies want most.

[v2] Users can search our system for a job title and view the many routes that
     people have taken to get that job. This relies on data with chronological
     listings of jobs from a source like the LinkedIn API.

#### Target Audience

This is aimed at anyone interested in a career change and wants to know more
about how to be competitive for that next job.

#### Integrations

#### Pitch

We help job seekers get to where they want to go.

#### Description

[Iteration 1] A user logs in with LinkedIn. Based on their location, the system displays
high growth related job categories in their region (sourced from gov data). Clicking on one
of the categories reveals related posts from glassdoor or whatever.

[Iteration 2] A user can click on a job and see a comparison of their skills (as indicated
on their LinkedIn profile or supplementally added) against required skills for a job.

[Iteration 3] For those places where a user's skills are deficient, he/she can view which
local institutions (tech schools, universities, etc) teach that skill.

about how to be competitive for that next job.
