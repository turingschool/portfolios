A simple application that sends you a SMS notice that lets you know
what type of clothes you might need to wear for the day.
#### Description
Based on the weather forcast for the rest of the day, this app will
simply let you know if you need a jacket or umbrella for the day ahead!
No need to check the weather anymore.  People visiting the site can
enter in a range for tempatures for needing a light jacket/sweater, or a
heavier coat.  Also they can specify at which percnetage change of 
percipation they get sent a text for rain.
.
#### Target Audience
For those that don't keep a jacket and raincoat on them very often or are too
lazy to check the weather.
#### Integrations

Facebook is used widely across a lot of people so might be most useful.
It can also use remember the milk, since this is an app used as a task
management tool, remembering to bring your jacket or raincoat seems like
a task that people that use this tool want to automate.

I would use weather undergroud as the API to help decide to 
use this app or not.

Also I think using rember the milk API could be useful if people don't want
to recieve texts daily, but have it create remind using RTM instead of getting
daily texts.




#### Idea 2
#### Pitch
Name that tune game, based on category two users compete to name the tune
in a certain amount of seconds

#### Description
Based of the popular gameshow from the late 80's players compete to name that
tune bidding back and forth and trying to fill in the answer correctly.

#### Target Audience
Any music lovers looking to have a little fun!

#### Integrations


Here I think the facebook OAuth makes the most sense.  It is the most
widely used I would assume across the people this tool is targeted towards.

This would make use of the spotify API and also lyricsfiy API to gather
information about the songtitle and artist.


#### IDEA 3

#### Pitch

Homebuyer, shows you information about schools and level of crime around
the house you are trying to buy.



#### Description
People can enter in a zipcode and see homes that are in that area. It will show
homes that have the price, crime level around that area, and also how
the schools are rated around that area as well. Other features would let you
sort by price, bedrooms, crime, best schools.  
#### Target Audience
Target audience in home buyers that are also concerned about schools in that 
area and also crime rates as well.
#### Integrations
I can use the public data available.  Data SF has an API about a lot of their
cities information, and crime data is public.  I also thought about integration
with zillows API that way you can find homes that are nearby your search area.

I think I would use facebook gain for OAuth for this audience. 


#### Idea 4
An application that looks for both a brewery and food truck, and based
on combined yelp ratings gives you best place to get a beer and some food.

#### Description
Someone can search by zip, type of food, or type of beer, and filter the
results of breweries and food trucks returned.  By default it will
return the best food truck brewery combo of the day.  It will pictures
of both the brewery and food truck loaded onto the page, and also easy
to read menus for both places. 

#### Target Audience
People looking for something to eat and drink after work.

#### Integrations
This will mainly use Yelps API but also use googlemaps to give location
information as well.  Also it will need to integrate twitter APIs so we
can find the locations of those food trucks as well.


#### Idea 5

#### Pitch
Based on what trail you pick and how many miles it is/difficult it is
we pack the necessary amount of food for you.  Too often people pack too
much or too little when they go hiking.

#### Description
People can find a trail and using the trail.api data.  This will
plot the trail for them and give them an idea of how long the trail is
recommended amount of time it takes to hike and will give them a list of food
items that we will pack for them, so they have just the right amount of food.
People can also list if they need stuff that is gluten free, and a special
comment box for other food allergies.  Email based portion will ask
them if they prefer one item over another is their package of food.

#### Target Audience
Amateur or newbie hikers who are unsure of what to pack when they go on a hike.
Also for the hardcore outdoor enthuisast that just love using our service
since we work with the best healthy food providers.

#### Integrations
I would use facebooks API since it is the most widely used.

I would use trail.api and if colorado had any open source info I would use
them as well.  Also I would make use of weather underground or some other
service that way when a hiker puts in the dates of his hike I can give
him a weather forcast as well!
