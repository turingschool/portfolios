### Idea One: Best Snow. Best Go.

**SELECTED**

# Pitch
This app will aggregate snowfall and travel data.

# Description
When a user opens the app, it will give them either:
- Previously selected 'favorite' resorts sorted by travel time or snowfall in
the last seven days
- The three nearest mountains based on current travel time and prioritized by
snowfall in the last seven days
- There will also be a Twitter RSVP integration

Two things define a weekend warrior's life: snowfall and traffic jams.  I think
this app would give that group a bit more power when planning their weekends.

# Target Audience
This app would appeal mostly to the weekend warriors of Colorado.

# Integrations
* OAuth Provider: Twitter
* Data.gov: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/daily-u-s-snow-monitoring
* Twilio for text notifications?

### Idea Two: Yes. You have homework.

[If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED** here]

#### Pitch
This app would simplify communication between teachers and students.

#### Description
* The teacher can update a class calendar with homework assignments
* The teacher can send 'task reminders' that would appear as notifications for
students
* Message board for questions and answers
* Students would also be able to send teacher questions via messaging center
* Links to assignments/resources

Typically all these lines of communication are separated out into three different
places.  I think boiling it down to one would greatly improve student/teacher
communication.

#### Target Audience
This app would appeal to teachers who want to simplify teacher-student
communication lines.

#### Integrations
* OAuth Provider: Google (most schools provide teachers and students with a
  Google account)
* Data.gov: Education
* Twilio
* Google Docs

### Idea Three: Daily Muchness

[If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED** here]

#### Pitch
This app would send you a daily inspirational quote, and then offer you a place
to plan your day from a positive aspect.

#### Description
* Automatically sends a daily inspirational quote via text or email
* When the app is opened it will ask you to enter a goal for the day, list
something that you're inspired by, etc.
* Syncs with your calendar to give you a run down of your day
* To-do list
* At the end of the day it prompts you to enter a brief sum-up of your day

#### Target Audience
I imagine this app would appeal to women in the 20s - 30s.

#### Integrations
* OAuth Provider: Facebook or Twitter
* Data.gov: Weather
* Twilio, Instagram
