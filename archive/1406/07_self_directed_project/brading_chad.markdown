### Time Tracker

SELECTED

#### Pitch

Daily scheduling app that lets you share your schedule with your
friends and view their schedules.

#### Description

Plan out your daily activities on a weekly planner. Choose which of your friends
you would like to share your schedule with, and get invited by your friends to
see their schedules as well. Upload photos and descriptions for events you went
to with friends so you can remember those moments. Send reminders or messages to
friends about upcoming events to build excitement. Use local weather forecasts to
help you make your schedule. At the end of each week receive a retrospective 
email recapping your week. It could also prompt each user to submit a personal 
summary of their week, store these entries and show the previous entry to the 
user at the end of the week.


#### Target Audience

The target audience would range from young to old adults. The uses would vary
for each demographic but each could customize it to their lifestyle.

#### Integrations

Facebook would make sense as an OAuth provider, as it would incorporate a daily
planner/scheduling component into their features. Google would also make sense
as it would expand on the capabilities of Google Calendar.

It would use data from Weather Underground to provide users with information 
about their local weather.


### Deep Space Exploration

#### Pitch

An interactive astronomy game for people interested in learning more about outer
space.

#### Description

The game would use images from planets, stars and other cosmic events to teach
users to recognize the difference between each of these objects. It could be
played using a memory style format, where images flash on the screen with their
name, and then the names disappear and the user must recall what each image is.
Other formats could be implemented where you have groups of categories, and the
user must identify what each group of objects is or has in common.

#### Target Audience

Young people in school or anyone who wants to learn more about astronomy would
be the target audience.

#### Integrations

Khan Academy or Coursera would make sense as an OAuth provider since it is an educational
game. Perhaps Google could be an alternative because of its popularity.

It would use images from NASA to create the content of the game.


### Airline Reviewer

#### Pitch

Airline review app that compares airlines based on number of flights delayed,
reasons for delay and average difference between takeoff and scheduled departure
time.

#### Description

The app would allow users to search by airline to get information on the
percentage of their flights that are delayed, what caused the delay and how late
the average flight was. They could choose two or more airlines to compare to see
how their statistics relate.

#### Target Audience

The target audience would be anyone that flies regularly or is trying to choose
an airline to fly with.

#### Integrations

Amazon or Google could be used as potential OAuth providers.

Airline On-Time Statistics and Delay Causes from the Research and Innovative
Technology Administration would be used to get data for the airline information.
