### [Project Title]

Open State Colorado (subject to change) **SELECTED**

#### Pitch

Based on location data and issues, present meaningful data retrieved from the
open-states API.

#### Description

A user will be able to input some location information, specify issues that they
are interested in, and recieve information about state-level government issues.
The two major features as I see them: users can be notified about bills in
progress that deal with issues they have selected, giving them very clear
options for who to contact should they want to get involved (sponsor_id as part
of a reqeust for a bill is an option here).  Users could also see voting
records from local representatives based on specified issues.

#### Target Audience

People interested in government issues at a state level who don't want to have
to dig to find bills/representatives relevant to their interests.

#### Integrations

* [What OAuth provider makes sense for this audience?]
Trying to cast the widest net might be my best option, so google/fb/twitter.

* [What Data.gov data or API will you use?]
This is where this idea shines I think, the Open States API from sunlight labs
(thanks jeff) is robust and has good documentation

* [Any other integrations?]
Possibly some integration that makes it stupidly easy to contact a representative,
such as being sms'd a phone number.
