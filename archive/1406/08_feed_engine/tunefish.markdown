## Notes

* For Today: logging in with OAuth, pull information from APIs, starting to build a feed
* Been working on OAuth, Ember app, built a client for getting data from the YouTube API, getting only music, getting the videos, get the subscriptions from youtube, track subscriptions in the database
* Tuesday: wireframes implemented into html/views, register for the site, link twitter, last.fm, youtube, soundcloud, feed displays youtube embedded videos from the channels that I subscribe to on youtube => Customer Ready
