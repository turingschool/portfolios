      notes: "Very nice working site and ordering system with extensive menu database. Site had routing issues, could use breaking out methods from the database, they are using SQL instead of Sequel, file structure needs organizing."

    setup_notes: "Needs (brew install imagemagick) ImageMagick. init.rb file will build a database for whatever env we are in."
    instructor_evaluation:
      notes: "Backend has powerful control of the front end.
              Wish that there were uses of Sequel's SQL tools rather than AR-style.
              Good mix of testing types and decent coverage.
              Break up big folders like your views into subfolders.
              Good work on the app.rb, but find out how to pull routes into different components.

      There is limited functionality without inputting a bunch of items into the database."

    instructor_evaluation:
      notes: "Adding a new page would be difficult.
              Could re-use some view templates / components.
              Hate Sequel::Model.
              A little bit of business logic leaking into app.rb.
              Overall a strong app but missed some learning goals."

      notes: "Pretty small collection of tests.
              Views have redundant HTML/wrapping.
              Unfortunate that view templates don't display database data.
              Needs about 2-3 days work on the view layer."
