        can't log out ;p~~~~~~
        users and accounts are the same thing
        nice use of presenters
        Good tests in general, tiny bit not covered, but not for a particularly good reason
        Can't log out, yo, sharing my cart with mah homies
        no link to category
        orders "all" counts current order

        Evaluated by Josh
        Feature Completeness
          No link to my profile/orders
          can see other people's orders
          cart is gone forever when I logout :(
          Can't edit user info
          admin orders missing total
          some links to transition that aren't actually available
          no Heroku :P
        Views
          use state machine instead of logic in admin orders view
          the logic that was there was wrong
          correctly indent the code
          find balance between the pristine pages (menu, front page) and the rest
        Controllers
          lots of dead code
          unnecessary json stuff
          session helper is better in application controller
          need to push knowledge of things like `role == 'admin'` down
        Models
        TDD
          high coverage, if you delete dead code :)
          things tested at feature level that would be better at a more focused level
            (e.g. I don't want to deal with the internet just to test how long a password can be)
        Usability
          most of the reasons are documented under features
          Unused routes
          most pages need aesthetic work
          the map doesn't show
