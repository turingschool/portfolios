  make "GET /menu" dynamic based on data from a controller. e.g.
    get '/menu' do
      @menu = [
        {name: 'Shared Bites',
         items: [
           { name: 'Greek Nachos'.
             price: '8',
             description: 'House made pita chips, hummus, gyro meat drizzled with red pepper aioli and raita sauce.'
           },
          ]}
      ]
    end

    <% @menu.each do |category| %>
      <h1><%= category[:name] %></h1>
      <ul>
        <li>...</li>
        ...
      </ul>
  can get menu items out of the database into some sort of usable form
  admin form:
    endpoint for "GET /admin/menu" renders a form based on same dynamic data as "GET /menu"
    form submits to "POST /admin/menu" (make an endpoint -- it does nothing -- but is authenticated)
    renders a form with the data filled in
  once you can get data out:
    generate the menu at "GET /menu" via the database data instead of being hard-coded in the view
    generate the form at "GET /admin/menu" via the db data
    when form is submitted "POST /admin/menu" take the form data and save it into the database

low priority
  to fix the links:
