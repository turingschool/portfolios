Checkin with: Josh Cheek
Herbert, Danny, Kate

To do:
  everybody do this first
    merge all relevant branches
      fix conflicts as appropriate (e.g. one kind of auth ;)
    delete merged branches (git push origin :branch-name)

  2 people do
    in conjunction
      Fill in values in the views from database
      When submitting the forms from the admin side, save them into the database

  1 person gets it on Heroku
    You'll have to do something like this:
      development do
        set :database, Sequel.sqlite('development.db')
      end
      production do
        credentials = ??
        set :database, Sequel.postgresql(credentials) # or maybe url
      end
    How to get credentials?
      ```
      $ heroku run bash
      $ echo $DATABASE_URL
      ```
      figure out how to parse that url
