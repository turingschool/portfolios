fix asssets by prepending a "/"

Advice: merge multiple times a day

users:
  people visiting the site
  admin wanting to update the price

To have value to the admin:
  Populate data on the view (/shop) from the database
  admin page
    form to edit the data (means an endpoint to render the form)
    submits, leading to db updates (means an endpoint to take the data and toss it into the db)
  auth of some sort
  put auth on admin page
  figure out how to connect the app to the Heroku db
    ```
    $ heroku run bash
    $ echo $DATABASE_URL
    ```
