  database
    play with Sequel until you can connect to your prod db
      ```
      $ heroku run bash
      $ echo $DATABASE_URL
      ```
    connect your app to your prod db
    create your schema in your prod db
    stick the location data into your prod db
    go help everyone doing the other shit
  data presented to users is dynamic
    edit the .erb file to generate the view from some type of data
    (I would start with an array of hashes)
  ability to edit the data
    a form to fill in
      make an endpoint: GET /admin/locations
      it renders a form with appropriate fields for a location
      ocne the db is in place, fill in the form data with the locations from the db
    submitting the form does shit
      another endpoint: POST /admin/locations
      once db is in place, it saves the form data into the db
