Delete the yaml stuff

1 at a time:
  Pick a thing (probably /dine-in)
    step
      take the menu and start daynamically filling in the data
      based on a hash that you set in your controller
    step
      make an admin endpoint
      ignore authentication
      render your form
    step
      that form posts to another admin endpoint
    step
      once the db stuff is in place
      go to the menu view (the one users see) replace that hash with data from the db
    step
      once the db stuff is in place
      go to the admin endpoint and save it into the db
    step
      once authentication is available
      stick it on the admin endpoints
Authentication
  Figure out how to use basic HTTP auth (or whatever is simple and easy)
  Put a method into your app that you can call to auth a request
Database
  Figure out what the fuck "database" even means for your app
    do it locally
    against postgres
  Figure out your heroku database credentials
    $ heroku run bash
    $ echo $DATABASE_URL
    might need to figure out how to parse the url
    or maybe Sequel can straight take the url
