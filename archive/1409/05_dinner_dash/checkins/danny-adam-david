Checkin with: Horace
Danny, Adam, David

Done:
  - db schema coming together; many models are created and validations in place
  - user auth flow seems good
  - test coverage seems pretty good; tdd seems ok; need to get them updated to reflect new status quo

todo:
  - seed data
  - build out frontend more
  - start looking at cart setup after Monday Cart class
  - biggest remaining data model chunk is orders -- would start looking at that soon
