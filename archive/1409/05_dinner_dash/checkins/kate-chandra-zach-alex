Checkin with: Horace
Zach, Kate, Chandra, Alex

Done:
  - basic frontend infrastructure coming together
  - db schema still quite minimal; need to model more of domain
  - code looking clean so far but not too much done

todo:
  - don't use ApplicaitonController for rendering actual endpoints - migrate root to use index of another controller
