### Just Talkin’ About Congress

### Pitch
This app visualizes/filters the words used in the Congressional Record, giving you an at-a-glance view of which issues lawmakers address on a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis.

### Problem
Keeping up with Congress — what they’re doing now and what they’ve already done — is a time-consuming task. There needs to be a way to search  by keyword or phrase to find what’s been said about specific issues.

### Solution

The JTAC app lets you filter words spoken by lawmakers on the House and Senate floor, allowing you to search for keywords and phrases of your choosing. Users are encouraged to share their findings on social media, to generate discussion of issues.

### Target Audience
Concerned citizens, registered voters, internet trolls, academics.

### Integrations
* Twitter makes sense as the OAuth provider here. Users can log in with their Twitter account and then share their search results. (Example tweet: Did you know Mark Quigley (IL-D) spoke to Congress about pizza in 2009?)
* I'll use Sunlight Foundation’s Capitol Words API, possibly also their Congress API to pull in relevant info about legislators
* I might also use Google maps or another mapping integration
