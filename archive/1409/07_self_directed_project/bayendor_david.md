### A Thousand Words

### Pitch

A picture is worth a thousand words

### Problem

Twitter limits users to only 140 characters, so tweets tends to be either laconic or links to other items.  On the plus side, tweets are very much a real time phenomenom, and Twitter trends can be very revealing during emerging stories of local or national interest.

Instagram provides a quick an convenient way to express artistic impressions via it's various photographic filters and share them quickly on the instagram stream.  

It would be interesting to discover what it would be like to find relationships between emerging twitter trends and the pictures that may (or may not) be trending on instagram simultaenously.

### Solution

Integrate twitter trending feeds and geolocation with pictures occurring from the same region, or with similar hashtags.

### Target Audience

Social media users, of moderate means in developed countries with access to the web who have accounts on one or both services.

### Integrations

* OAuth
* Twitter
* Instagram
* GeoLocation API of somekind
