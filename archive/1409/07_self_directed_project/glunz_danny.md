### MoodRing

### Pitch

Code Climate for analyzing the mood of your open-source project based on
sentiment analysis of commit messages.

### Problem

Collaboration and programming can both be very stressful endeavours. It can be
difficult to manage and keep contributors coming back to an open-source project.

### Solution

In order to entice new developers and retain current ones, it would be
beneficial to display the current morale of a project.

### Target Audience

Maintainers of open-source projects, businesses interested in quantifying
developer happiness, and curious coders.

### Integrations

* GitHub, bitbucket, etc.
* One of the many available [nlp APIs](http://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/dev/)
* Potentially other repo analysis tools to draw comparisons (i.e. CodeClimate to
  compare quality of code with happiness)
