### ArtR (WIP)

### Pitch

ArtR is an app that acts like Tinder for artists and artworks. If a user likes more than 3 artworks by an artist, they subscribe to that artist. The new artworks shown would come from related results.

### Problem

People interested in new artworks and artists don't have a way to interact with art in a fun setting. This would provide an interactive way for students to find and keep up with artists similar to those they currently like.

### Solution

This app provides artist/artwork recommendations based upon artists previously liked and narrows down preferences based on previously liked art.

### Target Audience

Art and art history students and buffs who are interested in finding more artwork and keeping up to date on contemporary art solutions.

### Integrations

* Twitter OAuth
* What API will you use? Artsy API
* Twilio to recieve text messages or Mandrill for email
