### SnowMaps

### Pitch

Colorado has a great selection of skiing and snow is not hard to come by. But, unfortunately, everytime I go skiing I must search multiple websites to find where the best snow is. If only there were a way to get the snow report for every moutain near me with one click. Snow Maps will bring the resort information you want to one page.

### Problem

The Epic Pass gives its owner the choice between unlimited access for 12 mountains in the U.S. This means navigating multiple resort websites to find the current snow reports, which is wasted time that could have been spent out on the hill.

### Solution

Create an app that allows anyone to get the snow report and trail/lift status from resort sites as well as current weather details displayed on one page.

### Target Audience

A skier/rider that owns a season pass or a house close to multiple mountains and enjoys skiing all sections of the mounatain
