### MV Listr

### Pitch

MV Listr is like Evernote for movie recommendations. Recommendations come from you via text message
and are organized on MV Listr with beautiful information from IMDB.

### Problem

Friends and family will talk about movies that you must see, but it's difficult to have a good place
see those recommendations. Note taking apps take too long to launch, are too hard to find among the
hundreds of apps located on your phone and get easily cluttered.

### Solution

MV Listr will accept input from text message that can be the title of movie, series or even episode of
a series. Your text messaging app usually the easiest for you to access on your phone and even integrates
with most dictating apps like Siri and Google Now. This makes it very quick to send recommendations to
MV Listr.

### Target Audience

Movie buffs, people who like lists.
