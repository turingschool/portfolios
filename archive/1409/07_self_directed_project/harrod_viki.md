### Funding Congress

### Pitch

A simple look-up for a list of your Congress people and their top funding sources

### Problem

Most people know that the funding for politicians heavily influences their decision
making, but that information isn't always easy to find. Without an easy way to
access that information, voters who might otherwise be more involved feel like
they cannot make informed voting decisions.

### Solution

A website that allows a user to look up their Congress people and get a list of
their top funding sources.

### Target Audience

Registered voters.
