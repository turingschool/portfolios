## Submission Guidelines

A pull request with your submission must be made at least 12 hours before your
scheduled defense. Non-conforming formats, filenames, or directories will be
rejected and your defense rescheduled.

### Self-Evaluation

Your submitted portfolio should include **self-assessment** scores. [Use the rubric](https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios/blob/master/rubric.markdown) to determine your proper scores.

### Filename & Directory

The file should be
saved in the format `"date-name-completing.markdown"` where:

* `date` is the last day of the module in compressed year/month/day, like `20150831`
* `name` is your first and last name like `jeff-casimir`
* `completing` is the module that you're completing, like `m4`

So a complete filename might look like `20150831-jeff-casimir-m4.markdown`. This
file needs to be stored in a directory `portfolios/students/your-cohort/your-name` where
`your-name` is like `jeff-casimir` and `your-cohort` is your cohort number.

If you were completing Module 4 in Cohort 1410 on August 31, 2015 and your name was Jeff Casimir, your portfolio submission would reside at the following location: `portfolios/students/1410/jeff-casimir/20150831-jeff-casimir-m4.markdown`.

## Evaluation Process

Your portfolio will be evaluated in the last week of the module by a panel of
at least two instructors. During this short session:

* You will start by showing the scores of your self assessment
* You will walk through the rubric and the content of your portfolio to explain
your scoring
* The instructors will ask questions along the way and record notes
* As you finish the explanation the instructors will validate or correct your
self-assessment scores
* The instructors will use those scores to render a promotion/graduation decision
* Everything from the instructors will be committed back to your portfolio

## Outcomes

Portfolio evaluations have four possible outcomes:

* *PROMOTED* - your portfolio demonstrates a successful fulfillment of expectations
and you may move on to the next module or graduate
* *RETAINED* - your portfolio is lacking in one or more areas and you may either
repeat the current module or leave the program
* *EXCUSED* - your portfolio is lacking in one or more areas and either (a) you've
now failed to pass the module in two attempts or (b) the reviewers have determined
that you will not be successful at Turing
* *PENDING* - your portfolio is incomplete or non-conforming and will be re-evaluated
as soon as possible. If it is incomplete after 24 hours it will be moved to *RETAINED* or *EXCUSED*
