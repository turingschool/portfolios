# Hannah Bare - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to be solid in HTML, CSS, and get familiarized with Javascript. I wanted to try to learn as much as possible.
I think doing Mod1 again would benefit me greatly. I had some troubles early on and although I feel like I've come a long way since then, I do believe that doing it again would allow me to dive deeper into the learning.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The first javascript project that we were given was an individual project. Here we were assigned to use our knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript to create Number Guesser.

#### NUMBER GUESSER

* [Number Guesser GitHub URL](https://github.com/hannahbare/numberguesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

  Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.  
  Phase 4 is optional. If you execute phase 4, create a separate branch in Git for that work for evaluation (using Git is an extra challenge – investigate how to initialize a Git repo and make a branch! We’ll go over how to do this in class in a few days, so this is a great time to investigate on your own).)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Throughout the module we were assinged a different pair project after Number Guesser. We were given the project on Thursday afternoons and they were due the following Thursday.

#### Linked List
With Maddy Dannenberg

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hannahbare/LinkedList)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

In it’s simplest form, the application should have the following:
Two input fields
One for the title of the bookmark
One for the URL that the bookmark should link to
One button for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page
A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display:
The title of the bookmark
The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL)
A button to “Mark as Read”
A button to “Remove” the bookmark

### Eval Comments
UI is a little squirrely as the screen size is reduced
some broken layout elements on mobile
good use of github, using issues and PRs
CSS could use a refactor
avoid percentages for margin and padding
absolutely positioned elements that likely don't need to be absolutely positioned

### Feedback To Me
Hannah, I was very happy with our end project! I think outside of some styling and responsive issues, we got a lot of positive feedback from Louisa. During the week, I appreciated how you initiated a full DTR and continued to check in throughout the week on our progress as a partnership. I think we worked well together figuring out git and GitHub and forcing ourselves to use it and kudos to us for figuring it out by the end! I know you were dealing with a lot of stress during the week and I appreciate how you communicated that with me. In the future, managing your stress will help you be even more effective in pairing and have more time to take on additional tasks. I appreciated that you clearly wanted to learn everything that was going on, and if we were to work together again I think you could improve by doing more outside research in order to figure out the javascript to learn and understand it deeper.


#### IdeaBox
With Ngoc Phan

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hannahbare/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

For this project, we’ll be increasingly thinking about the “server” and “client” as separate entities. We’ll be using:

JavaScript (with jQuery) to manage client-side interactions.
JSON and localStorage to persist data between sessions.
Your entire application will consist of one HTML page or template.

### Eval Comments
comp
content should not get bigger as page becomes smaller, try going mobile first next time
html
use aria-label instead of aria-labelledby check out this article: https://dev.opera.com/articles/ux-accessibility-aria-label/#accessible-name-calculation
css
consider organizational comments and using bem
set base font family and font-weight on a html element and override where necessary
js
pull duplicate blocks into functions and pass whatever is dynamic as an argument
love that you used a constructor function and especially a method on the prototype!!!
use more abstractional naming, ie. Idea instead of NewCard
git/github
get into habit of writing as much as you can within a commit message in 30 seconds or so. Verbosity is key!
Functional Expectations
Exceptional The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Eval Scores
(https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1711/mod-1/idea-box/hannah-ngoc.md)
HTML
Accessibility
Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
Style
Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
CSS
Structure of Code
Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.
Implementation
Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.
JAVASCRIPT
Data Types
Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
Conditional Logic
Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
Functions & Scope
Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
Arrays
Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
Objects & Prototypes
Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
Exceptional Can identify and apply best use cases for constructor functions vs object literals in their code, and leverages more advanced object prototype methods.
DOM Manipulation
Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
Style
Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.
GIT & GITHUB
Git
Novice Can use commits and can articulate what a commit is and why we use them. Makes large, infrequent commits directly to master branch.

Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.

Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

Exceptional Knows how to reset to previous commits, rebase large sets of small commits, if applicable, and other advanced Git maneuvers. Github

Novice Can articulate what GitHub is, how it is different from Git, and why it is important. Can comfortably push and/or pull changes from master.

Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.

Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

Exceptional Uses issues as resource for project management. There are comments on specific lines of pull requests with discussion about the implementation.

DESIGN
Comp Recreation
Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
PAIRING
Collaboration
Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
Exceptional Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.

### Feedback To Me
Hey Hannah! I’m very happy with our project! I know we didn’t get to phase four, but we learned a lot and I believe we took a lot away from what we did accomplish. I appreciated us working at a pace we both were comfortable with and asked questions of each other when one of us didn’t understand before we moved on. Thank you for accommodating my work schedule and my need to finish each function before taking a break. I apologize for not taking more poms. Since we both used vanilla javascript prior to this project, I think we should continue to work on our jQuery. It was very nice struggling through with you in this process. I believe our next project reiterates local storage so that’s something we can both work on. We can work on git too so we don’t spend 2 hours on it at the beginning of the next project. Try and be easier on yourself in future projects, not stress so much so you give yourself the opportunity to open your mind and express what you know. Overall, it was great working with you. We rocked it!


#### 2DoBox
With Om Seatehn

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hannahbare/2DoBox-pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Refactor and Pivot IdeaBox from another pair.

### Eval Comments
DESIGN/COMP
Made it through the middle of Phase 3 with strikethrough persisting!
Colors work together; however, cork background is kind of busy and distracting
Be sure to test for edge cases - when more text is entered for task section, words overflow from card
Use round button with checkbox for Task Completed to align with other buttons on card
No visual indication of when the submit button is disabled/enabled
HTML
Good job using labels - next time use aria-label attribute on inputs instead of label elements (since you are not using a visible label)
Be sure to run your app through a screen reader - although the main form is okay, the dynamically generated cards are not accessible.
Path for jquery file is not correct in line 40
CSS
Nice work updating the media queries in CSS
Love the #555555 hex code - 55555555555
Good job organizing declarations within selectors alphabetically. Next time, try using Idiomatic CSS for organizing declarations
Continue to use console for debugging/checking to see that declarations are doing something
JS
Nice work with using named functions for event handlers
What default behavior are you preventing in line 13?
Easy to follow/read the code. Functions are single responsibility
Some naming could be adjusted for clarity - showTask
Unused var in line 83 - jus return the retrievedKey that has been parsed. No need to save it in a variable to return:
return JSON.parse(retrievedKey);
Opportunites for refactoring with editTitle/editTask using .find()
GIT/GITHUB
Should be more commits for features completed
Remember to be consistently verbose in commit messages

### Feedback To Me
Our first challenge was that we were assigned a project during the break and that our internet gave up on us both while we attempted to work remotely for the first time! I really appreciated that you dedicated your time so that we could work together in person on holidays. Despite code-related frustrations that took place from time to time during the project, it's great that you ask questions about what you don't understand and it encourages me to do the same, to keep pushing for an answer especially when we feel overwhelmed. I still wholeheartedly believe that with perseverance, no matter how long or how many times it would take to go over unsolved problems, redoing them over and over until we can finally reproduce them is definitely a good goal for us. For the same reason that I absolutely enjoy being your classmate, you are very caring, thoughtful, quick on your feet and a very dedicated partner. We worked so hard and pushed through all those difficulties together. It was a pleasure working with you, Hannah! Let's keep on rocking and passing the stokes!


## D: Professional Skills
Gear up and Professional Development classes are extremely important for the success and growth of students at Turing. They helped me start off in the right direction for my mindset as well as gave me something to come back to in times of hardship. I am really glad that these classes were emphasized in Turing as I find it to be a major strength of what Turing offers.

### Gear Up

#### Health & Wellness: Growth Mindset

This was a really good class because it gave me the feeling that although I have things in my past in regards to learning, if I just continue to try that I can change my mindset. The concept of being able to do anything is definitely easier said than done but I really appreciated this and continue to practice it. I think this was hard for me during a time of high stress because I was putting pressure on myself that I "can do this" but yet the frustration of me not doing it was really high. I do think that it is a really powerful thought tool.

#### Health & Wellness: Stress & Self Care

* [GitHub URL](https://turingschool.slack.com/files/U794DR5KL/F8R3RGX9B/well-being_self_care_101.pptx)

The Health and Wellness classes about stress were very helpful. The meditation at the beginning, the natural objects on the table, and the understanding of what was happening to my brain at that moment was really important for me to experience. During this time my stress levels were really high and I realized that I needed to reach out to get support to overcome this obstacle. These classes help to balance out the type of learning and experiencing. I realized that I was going from an extreme environment to another extreme environment and being kind to myself about my stress was helpful.

#### Mod 4 Leads: Learn From Struggle

This was an interesting Gear Up. It was more about growth mindset as well as using grit to your advantage and how to alter your experience with failure. I had a moment in this gear up where I realized that the build up to failure is much worse than the actual failure itself. I've been keeping this in mind as I continue through my projects and evals.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I feel good about how I participated within Turing. I helped clean and put away dishes in the kitchen, I moved the plants from the kitchen to different parts of the school as well as continue to water them, and I reached out to different mods for support/conversation throughout the mod for inter-mod communication.
