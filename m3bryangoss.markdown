# Bryan Goss - M3 Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I was hoping to refine my skills and speed up my workflow. I also hoped to become better at working in teams.

### End of Module Assessment

Notes:

*  Woohoo - no hashes in the view!
*  A few extraneous instance vars in SearchController,
*  nice parse/response methods in service,
*  application_controller needs protect from forgery null session for API create and delete actions to work,
*  service and model are not tested

1. Ruby Style:              3, Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components
2. Rails Syntax & API:      3, Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
3. Testing:                 3, Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested
4. Progression/Completion:  3, Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.
5. Workflow: 4, Developer commits every 15 minutes

### Work

I learned a lot from my individual projects, specifically that I work better as part of a team. I lost sight of orginizational and planning tools that I used well on group projects. I allowed a sense of panic to distract me from using a good workflow and design practice.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

### To Jasmin:
YOU CRUSHED THE COMMENTS! I appreciate the way you voiced concern about not having had enough challenging tasks. I wish I had worked with you more but I'm glad we took a look at the Comments API together.

### To Sonia:
You did an amazing job getting Amazon S3 working. I think you underestimate yourself, and you often believe people are judging you more harshly than they actually are. Its great that you have such high standards that I felt like I had to work to live up to them.

### To Matt:
You definitely took our feedback from the Re-DTR seriously, and I like that you spoke up more. I think even if you feel like an introvert, you can find a way of working that keeps an open line of communication with the team. Its important that we know when you're going to be late or what you're working on. I can tell you worked really diligently and I'm happy with the result we all achieved, thanks in part to your efforts.

### Being a Community Member

### From Sonia

Bryan, it was such a pleasure working with you. I think we really became good friends on this project, and I'm so glad to know you. I don't think any of my feedback will be much of a surprise to you because I feel we communicated pretty well throughout the project. You did a great job when we were pairing because you allowed me to drive more (we had talked about this) but I think perhaps you could have allowed me to speak more, particularly when I wanted to be involved in our discussions with instructors, in order to foster a shared feeling of engagement in the problem-solving process. Overall, however, I really appreciated having the chance to work with you. I consider you to be a true friend and I've learned a lot from you. You're bright, funny, and kind. Keep on keeping on. :)

### From Jasmin:
The effort in which Goss puts forth in making sure his communication and feedback is kind and specific has really impressed me. He is excellent at explaining his understanding of more complex technical concepts, but one thing I would ask him to be a bit more conscious of is his how he speaks of himself in the first person when referring to group work to instructors. For example, when we were pairing together on a task and we needed to ask for client clarification from Lauren, he used the phrase, "I have a problem," as opposed to "we have a problem." This is a relatively small thing, but it can go a long way to a group mentality in the long run. He is still really easy to pair with and I feel that together we get a lot of work done efficiently.



### Playing a Part

I have been very active in supporting and cultivating the Armstrong Posse. When I joined in mod 1 there were about 3 people who were active. A couple Friday Spikes we've done have had more than 15 people attend. I started working on a "cirriculum" to ensure the posse would have direction and goals even after I finish Turing.

In addition I strive to always be a resource for my cohort and others. I helped a couple people with active record / SQL troubles, participated in the Prework-guides and gave time to support students in mod 1.

## Professional Skills

### Gear Up

The most recent gear up related to resiliance. I am glad I had that experience during my Personal Project, because that project was a struggle. My group discussed how we distinguish resiliance from a postitive or optimistic outlook. Imagine two people. They endure the same events and succeed. One person views the events as a struggle but the other views them as an challenge. Does the former demonstrate more resiliance than the latter, or does the latter's positive mindset embody resiliance?

On the subject of voting, the Gear Up gave us lots to think about with respect to our civic responsibility. I wish we had more time to discuss the issues, but there was a lot of intersting material to read.

And finally, the conversation about how to be an introvert in a professional setting made me think about ways to accomodate an introvert without forcing them to be more extraverted. I am not sure I have solutions, but as in many cases, I'm sure asking the individual about their preferences is a good start.

### Personal Project Pitch  
### Skillist

#### Pitch

If you're looking into taking time off to learn a new skill, how do you know the skill you're going to learn is a valuable one?

#### Problem

Programming as an industry has a volitile and flexibile work force. The fastest way to advance is usually to switch jobs. Part of that job switching might include aquiring a new skill, but picking the best one can be a subjective process.

#### Solution

My app will help users make choices about programming launguages by providing data about job postings. It will rank languages and show the share of job postings related to those languages over time. The results will be tailored to a user's location by searching for postings within a certain distance to a zipcode.

#### Target Audience

Programmers, especially those who are switching into or within the industry, need good data to make choices about their futures. Many programmers use data to make choices in their jobs, so having data to make choices *about* thier jobs is a natural fit.

#### Integrations

I plan to use the Indeed API to find a list of job postings  
I plan to authenticat with Github using OAuth and as an extention, I plan to check languages that users employ and compare those choices to job postings.

### Job Search Plan

My Plan for searching for jobs relies on networkin in Portland and Seattle. Since the Turing Network is less well established in that area, I will have to rely on myself more than the average grad. 

Daily: Spend at least a couple hours researching companies, individuals and jobs in the Portland or Seattle area. This will inlcude research on Linkedin, Glassdoor, Twitter and other sources.

Weekly: Contact at least 5 - 10 people per week to investigate the job scene. Ask questions about the jobs they have, and let them know that I'm looking for work.

Monthly: I hope to achieve at least one interview a month. I will travel to Seattle at least once a month for meetups.

### Alumnus Profile

### Flower Exercise

1 Favorite People to Work with: I prefer working with people who are passionate about learning and using good practices, even if it means that things move slower in the short term.  
2 Values and goals: I value leaving the world better than I found it. My Goals include retiring and traveling.  
3 Preferred Places to Live: I prefer a temperate climate in an urban setting with forests near by. This lends itself to the Pacific Northwest.
4 Preferred Pay and Level of Responsibiltiy: I feel more comfortable directing the process but not setting the final goal. I wouldn't enjoy having creative responsibilty, but I can see myself managing others in some capacity, eventually.
5 I work best with short deadlines
