Name: Beth Sebian

Assessed By: Horace

Github Repo: https://github.com/bethsebian/night_writer

Notes:

* Basic functionality for encoding text -> braille
* Missing read functionality
* Encoding makes effective use of a map of characters -> braille glyphs
* Encoding process would be improved by relying on enumerators
to detect and process text more flexibly rather than expecting known character
positions
* Overall solid direction but need to get it more finished

Scores:

* Overall Functionality - 1

Name: Brant Wellman

Assessed By: Horace

Github Repo: https://github.com/brantwellman/Turing-NightWriter

Notes:

* Writer works well
* Reader still in progress
* Effective manipulation of ruby to get things done; resulting code
isn't always perfect but we are able to bend it to our will
* Would like to see file I/O split out from core reading and writing
logic
* Would like to see more methods taking and returning values rather
than modifying ivars
* Some chances remain for better enumerable use to avoid hardcoded
positions or successive modification of ivars

Name: Brennan Holtzclaw

Assessed By: Horace

Github Repo: https://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/night-writer

Notes:

* Not a lot of progress; many issues seemed to come up
during development causing process to stall heavily
* Need to focus going forward on carving out smaller pieces
of the problem to make definitive progress
* Some of the struggles seemed to stem from rehashing the same
pieces multiple times; testing might be a good way to check these
off and allow us to move on to other pieces

Scores:

* Overall Functionality - 1
* Fundamental Ruby & Style - 1

Name: Daniel Winter

Assessed By: Horace

Github Repo: https://github.com/danjwinter/night_writer

Notes:

* Solid functionality getting base and number processing
* A few opportunities for using more appropriate enumerables,
especially map in cases where we are iteratively shoveling onto things
* Overall structure effectively leverages internal instance variables
to put things together; would have preferred to see more clean input/output
methods, but given the structure we chose it's consistent with itself
* Put other classes/modules in their own files
* Add an overall runner/orchestrator method so that we don't have to
manually engage each step from outside
* Good use of testing to cover edge cases and various specific pieces of
functionality

Scores:

* Overall Functionality - 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style - 3
* Test-Driven Development - 3

Name: Hector Baeza

Assessed By: Horace

Github Repo: https://github.com/hectorhuertas/night_writer

Notes:

* Don't micromanage your object -- give it a single method for overall
task and have that cover the steps
* Watch out for Map enumerable pattern -- creating empty objects and
iteratively appending to them is a case for map
* Look for opportunities to transform hardcoded data to inputs to some
dynamic method
* Don't be afraid to establish more meaningful vocabulary and terms
specific to your problem
* Pay attention to the level and importance you're assigning to various
system components -- don't hide something as a local variable if it's
an important piece

Scores:

* Overall Functionality - 1
* Fundamental Ruby & Style - 2
* Test-Driven Development - 3
* Breaking Logic into Components - 2.5


Name: Joseph Perry

Assessed By: Horace

Github Repo: https://github.com/jwperry/Jet-turing-1module/tree/master/2project/night_writer

Notes:

* Good functionality and completion
* Method chaining design is a little wonky; could be re-worked
to be adjacent method calls
* Look out for opportunities to leverage more enumerable methods
instead of just using each (especially map -- watch for cases where
we create an empty string or array and shovel into it)
* Testing needs work; the restructurings mentioned above will
help greatly with this
* Probably have opportunities to extract more separate classes
as well -- think about what the overall steps of the night writer
process are and how could we pull these apart
