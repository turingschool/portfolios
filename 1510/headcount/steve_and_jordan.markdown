## Notes

* Spec harness passes
* Felt the beginning of the project was slow to launch, once 0 was through, 1 was fast, 2 was slow, 3 was fast
* 158 tests pass
* Testing of features looks really solid, probably some space for more edge case testing
* Implementation looks good, small methods, clear code, etc
* For next time: analysis take a long time, especially iteration 2, dealing with NaN error, not clear where the intended difficulty is, what to do with the non-values, trash data, etc
