## Notes

* Finished late last night, know where we want to refactor but didn't want to break things
* Passes all of the spec harness
* 154 tests all pass -- FAST
* Tests look good, make time for edge cases (you already did the hard work)
* Excellent use of small data files for tests
* Implementation looks strong
* Only use @instance variables when setting, not getting
* Very good project
