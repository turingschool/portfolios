### Notes

* Admir and Alex decided to split partway through the project and each
work independently
* The 2 projects reached a comparable level of completion -- still mostly
working through some basic data processing for the first iterations
* Struggles around workflow and process slowed down the project at the
beginning
* Main objective for next time around is to really hammer on fundamentals
so that when we get back to this project we can move at a much more
fluid pace
