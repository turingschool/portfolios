### Notes

* Excellent work overall; code is clean both at the low level (methods, lines, etc)
and at the high level design
* Good use of abstractions around pulling out and manipulating data -- helps
keep the analytical structure very clean
* Volumnious testing -- covering everything including various helper/data processing
operations within the test suite
* Completes all iterations and the team seems to have spent a lot of time helping
the group overall, including lots of spec harness contributions
