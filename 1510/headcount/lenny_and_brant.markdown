## Notes

* Spec harness: pass iterations 0, 1
* Your tests: 105 all passing
* Testing looks good, try to strip down the data to just what you need, look for opportunities for just a bit of extraction/reuse
* Implementation looks clean, did some good refactoring
* Solid foundation to keep building
* Deliver code that passes the spec harness for I3 on Tuesday
