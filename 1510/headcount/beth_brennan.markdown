### Notes

* Great testing overall - quite thorough and voluminous and covering
juicy edge cases
* Completion is solid through I2; starting to dig into the I3 topics
* Code is pretty consistent across the board
* Main consistent weaknesses are over-reliance on `each` as the only
iterator and difficulty flattening code branches into more linear
steps that can be understood more easily
* Has handful of "whoa" methods where things break down in terms of structure,
hierarchy, and length

### Rubric

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

#### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:methods` shows...

* 3: Five or fewer complaints
