## Notes

* 56 tests
* Tests have a good progression and are well organized
* Probably space for some edgecases in tests
* Implementation is strong, clean, organized
* Look for more opportunities to extract/encapsulate functionality

## Scores

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
