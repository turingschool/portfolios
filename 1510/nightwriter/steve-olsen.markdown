## Notes

* 12 tests
* Testing is ok, would like to see more in number, push on the edge cases, and break down god methods into smaller pieces
* Code is a bit complex but can be understood
* Great opportunity to work on refactoring with a mentor

## Scores

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
