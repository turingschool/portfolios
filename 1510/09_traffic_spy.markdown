* 64 tests, 106 assertions, all passing.
* No extensions
* cool text entry identifier on front page
* 96.93% test coverage
* generally good testing, didn't test error page
* Some opportunities to refactor, pull things out to other methods.
* Little bit of logic leaking to the view.


Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:
1. Functional Expectations

    3: Application fulfills base expectations

2. Test-Driven Development

    4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

    4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

    3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

    4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.

6. View Layer

    3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

Notes:

* 79 tests, 190 assertions, all passing
* Good use of helper methods in tests.
* 99.54% Coverage

* Try to lighten up on use of instance variables in controller.
* Some minor refactoring possible with pulling things out of controller
or refactoring to pull out code to methods.

Notes:

* 104 assertions 47 test,
* 96.5 coverage
* Used a few partials.
* Some opportunities to refactor ruby into separate methods.
* I liked how you used methods to abstract out conditionals.
* Think aobut how you would refactor to make use of Poros and helper
methods in your view.
