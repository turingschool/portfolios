* it works!
* one extension
* 37 tests

__Comments:__

* base functionality for decrypt and encrypt is solid; not quite there on cracking
* Follows prescribed interface pretty closely
* Good number of tests that seem to be organized fairly evenly according to objects/
responsibility
* Overall ruby structure is getting pretty solid
* Enumerables still need a little work -- watch especially for map / reduce
patterns when you see repeated array modifications
* method extraction is good; watch for naming to generally represent
the value that the method generates

__Comments:__

* Base functionality is all there and seems solid
* 28 tests; seem to be spread across various objects; probably
could use a few more, but overall volume is ok
* Lots of opportunities remain to use some more sophisticated enumerables
* Watch especially for the map pattern (make empty array, then iteratively
push onto the array)
* In general we can trim a lot of the methods by relying on enumerables to
generate new values rather than having to reassign variables at each step
* Some of the methods are getting long and could use some extraction
* Watch out for "magic numbers" hanging out -- would like to keep putting
semantic names on these

__Comments:__

* 13 tests, they pass
* Implementation works after following a Cheek tutorial/video
* Learned a lot from help/support
* Use next week's project to judge whether Headcount will be worthwhile or whether to go for more of a tutorial/remediation approach
