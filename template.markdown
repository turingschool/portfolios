# Brett Rivers - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I want to keep a scheduled meeting time with my mentor, be active with my posse, and reach 35 wpm typing.
I did not accomplish any of these goals, next time going through mod 1 I will make goals based on where I need to grow.

## Assessed By: Beth Sebian

## Notes:
* Repo here: https://github.com/riverswb/date_night
* Missing `load` and `health` base methods
* Testing sufficient, would like to see more unit and edge-case tests
* `Insert` implemented using recursion, while `sort`, `min`, `max` implemented with hash holding data
* Overall strong start: in spite of completion shortcomings, the project demonstrates some comfort with Ruby principles and tactics. 


(evaluation scores)

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion
* 2: Application has issues with loop/recursion techniques or mixes them inappropriately 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)


#### (Complete Me)

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

(description)

The purpose of complete me is to build an autocomplete system with a trie data structure. A trie consists of nodes which know the location of their children, but not their parents. Nodes are unaware of the key with which they are associated. Keys are defined entirely by the node's location in the trie. In our case, the only bit of information that a node stores aside from it's children, is a boolean to describe whether or not it is a word.

Notes:
* Completed base expectations and extension: Shoes
* TDD functional, focuses mostly on high-level tests that verify methods do-all-the-things. Opportunities exist to test supporting methods. Overall, solid. 
* Encapsulation: methods managing multiple levels of responsibility, need to extract execution of distinct tasks into concise, explicitly-named methods, opportunities to improve naming overall to aid readability
* Style often solid, but with some inconsistencies: double negatives (!= nil?) and "if nil?" instead of unless. Opportunities to create more clear parallelism in code.
* Execution of project didn't require many enumerables. Some sounds use, some missing opportunities to consolidate tasks (ex: sanitizing letters)

(evaluation scores)

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown]()

It was difficult to refrain from talking about the current election in the context of this discussion, but I was totally impressed by everyone's judicious efforts to not inject their own personal opinions into the fray. We were all more or less in agreement that we appreciated when leaders are able to clearly articulate their positions while remaining pragmatic about their proposed solutions.
