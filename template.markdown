## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The solo projects this mod facilitated a significant amount of growth in the thinking behind test driven development via implementation of sorting algorithims and data structures. 

#### Sorting Suite

* [Sorting Suite GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamMescher/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

Sorting algorithms are one of the common domains for studying Computer Science data structures and algorithms. They give us an opportunity to focus on algorithms of various complexity all solving a relatively simple problem.

In this project, I was challenged to implement four fundamental sorting algorithms: 

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Merge Sort
4. Quick Sort

Testing

Nice tests
Instead of using timeout to force each test to run 10000, I would rather see different array lengths
Part of the point of the testing suite was for you to see the varying efficiencies of the different sorts
Bubble

For your own benefit, try refactoring these into ES6
export default
const
arrow functions
Good use of destructuring
Insertion

See feedback for Bubble
Merge

The lets can be consts since they're not being mutated.
In the merge function, the second two while loops can be refactored into result.push(...right, ...left)
Quick

The pivot can be array.pop() - then you don't have to worry about accidentally iterating over it in the for loop
If you do that, the for loop must be changed to include i < array.length
Score:

Pass


#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamMescher/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

Complete-Me is a project that takes a deep dive into the prefix trie data structure. It was fascinating to learn about linked lits, doubly linked lists, binary trees, and binary search trees along the way to figuring out how to properly implement the prefix trie.

Evaluator comments:

Very strong understanding of SRP (duplicate code broken into helper functions, etc)
Good organization with obvious refactoring
Score is pending until complete, passing test suite is submitted
1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
2. Test-Driven Development

Score pending submission of completed, passing test suite

4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
4. Functional Expectations

3.5: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The projects in Mod 2 gave much less rigid and gave some room to be creative while also meeting the underlying requirements.

#### Game Time

* [Game Time GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamMescher/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Game Time was a project meant to introduce HTML5 Canvas. My partner and I chose Snake from the list of games and ended up with a project to which I am proud to attach my name. 

Functional Expectations

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
User Interface

3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
Testing

3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

#### Weathrly

* [Weathrly Repository](https://github.com/AdamMescher/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

This project was a fantastic introduction into React and API calls via fetch. While there were some significant struggles, by the end I feel excited to continue learning more about React in the future. 

Comments:
Lovely interface and good UI
Good test suite
Passing too many individual props to components; save in an object and pass the object
Can use a little refactoring (reuse Card component) but overall a solid grasp of components and state
Specification Adherence

3.5 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

HTML Style

3.5 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS/Sass Style

3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

JavaScript / React Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

Testing

3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

Workflow

3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills

(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Empathy and Privilege

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

This gear up was an interesting look at how others see the world. It's easy to get lost in your own bubble and ignore the struggles of others I had never contemplated before. My takeaway from this gear up was that it's possible to have significant blind spots and the only way to learn more about them is to be exposed to the personal experience of others. I hope to be much more careful of my assumptions about others and to be more mindful of whether or not I am truly empathetic of their experience. 


#### Empathy and Privilege

* [Groupthink GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/groupthink.md)

My biggest takeway from the groupthink gear up was the realization of how easy it is to fall prey to gropupthink. What most people would attribute as strength - familarity and monoculture, is the thing that needs to be most fought against. The example of the Bay of Pigs was a very strong reminder that surrounding yourself with or becoming a yes man can have significant consequences for any organization. This lesson encouraged me to be the one asking hard questions confidently. 


#### Privacy

The Mod 4 led discussion surrounding privacy was a fascinating look at what privacy means to the individual and how an aspiring developer should respond accordingly. My takeaway from this session was the realization that data may be collected with good intentions but never deleting that information may allow that information to be used for nefarious actions in the future. Thus, Data collection without deletion means that the data could fall into the wrong hands at any time, either through hacking or the business failing and being bought by others. As a developer, I want to learn more about an intelligent way to sunset user data. 


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I set out to participate in a larger number of extra events organized by Turing memebers. Attending events such as the demo night and hearing speakers from companies during lunch were wonderful ways to further my understanding of what is expected of me both within Turing and after I depart. 

I emphasized ensuring adequete pairing slots for Mod 1. I gave up my lunch hour each day for 4 weeks, and that time was utilized all but 2 days. It was rewarding to spend time helping others learn more while also reinforcing my own undestanding of the material I learned 7 weeks prior. 

Overall, I feel a much stronger bond to the Turing community as a whole as Mod 2 draws to a close.
