## A: End of Module Assessment

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 1
## Evaluator: Bree
## Optional Notes:

* Need to practice more in terminal and navigating comfortably with commands
* Good job reading the error messages and identifying when your syntax was an issue
* Just need a lot more practice writing js and gaining confidence in how things are working
* You understand the steps for what needs to happen, you just need more comfort in writing the code, which will come with increased practice

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Proficient:__ Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

#### Conditional Logic

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is "truthy" and "falsey" in JavaScript.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Novice:__ Can write a simple function that takes at least one input argument.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Novice:__ Can declare an object literal and define/articulate properties vs. methods for an object. Can extract values of an object's property, and assign new properties and/or reassign values of existing properties on an object.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.

#### Style

* __Novice:__ Can explain the choices made in the overall codebase and is able to articulate what every line of code is doing. Code is neatly formatted and easy to read with correct indentation.





# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 2

## Evaluator: Robbie

## Optional Notes:

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.

#### Conditional Logic

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is "truthy" and "falsey" in JavaScript.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

#### Arrays

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

#### Style

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## TESTING

#### Test Comprehension

* __Advanced Beginner__: Can read through a test and understand the structure. Can make the test pass, but takes a few attempts because developer does not use error messages effectively.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DEBUGGING

#### Dev Tools/Debug Process

* __Advanced Beginner__: Can articulate and leverage all the features of the "Elements - Styles" pane, including: find, edit html, state toggles, adding new elements/classes, and can read/track sections of the Elements-Styles pain (separated by grey dividers) back to their codebase.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DEBUGGING

#### Dev Tools/Debug Process

* __Novice__: Reaches for the dev tools "Elements" pane to experiment and test variations for their HTML/CSS. Uses the "Console" pane in conjunction with their coding to test outputs of their JS at appropriate times.
