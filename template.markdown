## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The solo projects this mod facilitated a significant amount of growth in the thinking behind test driven development. 

#### Sorting Suite

* [Sorting Suite GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamMescher/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

This project was a wonderful introduction to sorting algorithms and the thinking process behind them. 

Testing

Nice tests
Instead of using timeout to force each test to run 10000, I would rather see different array lengths
Part of the point of the testing suite was for you to see the varying efficiencies of the different sorts
Bubble

For your own benefit, try refactoring these into ES6
export default
const
arrow functions
Good use of destructuring
Insertion

See feedback for Bubble
Merge

The lets can be consts since they're not being mutated.
In the merge function, the second two while loops can be refactored into result.push(...right, ...left)
Quick

The pivot can be array.pop() - then you don't have to worry about accidentally iterating over it in the for loop
If you do that, the for loop must be changed to include i < array.length
Score:

Pass

Evaluator comments:

Very strong understanding of SRP (duplicate code broken into helper functions, etc)
Good organization with obvious refactoring
Score is pending until complete, passing test suite is submitted
1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
2. Test-Driven Development

Score pending submission of completed, passing test suite

4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
4. Functional Expectations

3.5: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Game Time

* [Game Time GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamMescher/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Functional Expectations

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
User Interface

3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
Testing

3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

#### Weathrly

Comments:
Lovely interface and good UI
Good test suite
Passing too many individual props to components; save in an object and pass the object
Can use a little refactoring (reuse Card component) but overall a solid grasp of components and state
Specification Adherence

3.5 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

HTML Style

3.5 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS/Sass Style

3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

JavaScript / React Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

Testing

3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

Workflow

3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints
