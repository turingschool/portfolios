# (Beth Knight) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This was my first in person programming course. I had worked with frameworks before for rails and ios and I wasn't understanding the fundamentals of what was going on behind the scenes. It was my goal coming into this program to really understand the algorithms that run everything. This included really grasping the ruby syntax and using tests to write code that could continuously be improved.
