# (Beth Knight) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This was my first in person programming course. I had worked with frameworks before for rails and ios and I wasn't understanding the fundamentals of what was going on behind the scenes. It was my goal coming into this program to really understand the algorithms that run everything. This included really grasping the ruby syntax and using tests to write code that could continuously be improved.

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

When I first started I was extremelly confident in my abilities and so I joined Echo. In hindsight I wish I had gone with Foxtrot and worked more on the fundamentals instead of diving into big projects that overwhelmed me. It did force me to really step up to the plate and push through some fairly advanced concepts. I also learned to seek out help from mentors which I think will be key later on.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group work was a little difficult for me because I felt I might drag my partner down because I was constantly questioning my ability. While this fear never went away, I thought it was amazing to have someone to bounce ideas off of. Overall we were able to achieve more together than we ever would alone.
