# Hannah Bare - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to be solid in HTML, CSS, and get familiarized with Javascript. I wanted to try to learn as much as possible.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The first javascript project that we were given was an individual project. Here we were assigned to use our knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript to create Number Guesser.

#### NUMBER GUESSER

* [Number Guesser GitHub URL](https://github.com/hannahbare/numberguesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.
Phase 4 is optional. If you execute phase 4, create a separate branch in Git for that work for evaluation (using Git is an extra challenge – investigate how to initialize a Git repo and make a branch! We’ll go over how to do this in class in a few days, so this is a great time to investigate on your own).)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Throughout the module we were assinged a different pair project after Number Guesser. We were given the project on Thursday afternoons and they were due the following Thursday.

#### Linked List
With Maddy Dannenberg

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hannahbare/LinkedList)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

In it’s simplest form, the application should have the following:
Two input fields
One for the title of the bookmark
One for the URL that the bookmark should link to
One button for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page
A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display:
The title of the bookmark
The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL)
A button to “Mark as Read”
A button to “Remove” the bookmark

### Eval Comments
UI is a little squirrely as the screen size is reduced
some broken layout elements on mobile
good use of github, using issues and PRs
CSS could use a refactor
avoid percentages for margin and padding
absolutely positioned elements that likely don't need to be absolutely positioned

### Feedback To Me
Hannah, I was very happy with our end project! I think outside of some styling and responsive issues, we got a lot of positive feedback from Louisa. During the week, I appreciated how you initiated a full DTR and continued to check in throughout the week on our progress as a partnership. I think we worked well together figuring out git and GitHub and forcing ourselves to use it and kudos to us for figuring it out by the end! I know you were dealing with a lot of stress during the week and I appreciate how you communicated that with me. In the future, managing your stress will help you be even more effective in pairing and have more time to take on additional tasks. I appreciated that you clearly wanted to learn everything that was going on, and if we were to work together again I think you could improve by doing more outside research in order to figure out the javascript to learn and understand it deeper.









#### IdeaBox
With Ngoc Phan

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hannahbare/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

For this project, we’ll be increasingly thinking about the “server” and “client” as separate entities. We’ll be using:

JavaScript (with jQuery) to manage client-side interactions.
JSON and localStorage to persist data between sessions.
Your entire application will consist of one HTML page or template.

### Feedback To Me
Hey Hannah! I’m very happy with our project! I know we didn’t get to phase four, but we learned a lot and I believe we took a lot away from what we did accomplish. I appreciated us working at a pace we both were comfortable with and asked questions of each other when one of us didn’t understand before we moved on. Thank you for accommodating my work schedule and my need to finish each function before taking a break. I apologize for not taking more poms. Since we both used vanilla javascript prior to this project, I think we should continue to work on our jQuery. It was very nice struggling through with you in this process. I believe our next project reiterates local storage so that’s something we can both work on. We can work on git too so we don’t spend 2 hours on it at the beginning of the next project. Try and be easier on yourself in future projects, not stress so much so you give yourself the opportunity to open your mind and express what you know. Overall, it was great working with you. We rocked it!











#### 2DoBox
With Om Seatehn

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hannahbare/2DoBox-pivot)

### Feedback To Me
Our first challenge was that we were assigned a project during the break and that our internet gave up on us both while we attempted to work remotely for the first time! I really appreciated that you dedicated your time so that we could work together in person on holidays. Despite code-related frustrations that took place from time to time during the project, it's great that you ask questions about what you don't understand and it encourages me to do the same, to keep pushing for an answer especially when we feel overwhelmed. I still wholeheartedly believe that with perseverance, no matter how long or how many times it would take to go over unsolved problems, redoing them over and over until we can finally reproduce them is definitely a good goal for us. For the same reason that I absolutely enjoy being your classmate, you are very caring, thoughtful, quick on your feet and a very dedicated partner. We worked so hard and pushed through all those difficulties together. It was a pleasure working with you, Hannah! Let's keep on rocking and passing the stokes!
