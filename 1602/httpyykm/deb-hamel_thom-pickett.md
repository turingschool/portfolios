Assessor: Lovisa

Notes:

- completed iteration 0-4, does not follow the spec fully but has all functionality included
- very good tests, easy to read, well organized. Could use some DRYing up in terms of lvars and shared data
- overall very nice project, well factored and mostly easy to read.
- there's opportunity to DRY up some functinoality in modules.

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
