notes:

* application works, through iteration five.
*  37 tests
* Some really long methods, can pull out a lot of code to shorten up methods
* examples of this include conditional branches
* pull conditions out to methods returning booleans to increas readability
* Some repetition of code.



## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
