* Clean and thorough implementation overall
* love the volume of tests
* Code is generally clean and well-organized at the small level
* Biggest area for improvement is continuing to strip down and
streamline the conceptual process at the high level
* Overall tests and implementation have some tendency to run around the
core of the idea -- reliance on extra ivars, nested methods, etc
* Keep thinking about what is the core idea of a process and how
to most clearly express that in code -- for a problem like this code should
read like an outline of what the actual algorithm is

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
