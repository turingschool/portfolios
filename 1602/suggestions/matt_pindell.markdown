Notes:

Repo: https://github.com/pindell-matt/binary-search-tree

* Good project with 2 extra methods added in
* Effectively delegates more responsibilities to the Node class to
keep each recursive process more concise
* at the small level methods are generally short, concise, easy to read
* only structural quibble is with storing node depth in the nodes -- ideally
would calculate this information dynamically from the node's position in
the tree


### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
