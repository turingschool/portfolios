Notes:

* good implementation -- hit the baseline features, added
some travis ci, got some substr-specific suggestions
* Insert process is pretty clean; suggestions get a little hairier
* Recursion over all is coming together; keep plugging on that idea
* Biggest topics we talked about is making more deliberate divisions
between methods or parts of a process (some of these feel a little arbitrary)
* To aid this process, try to identify at each step what value is being
provided and what value is being returned
* This helps us code without relying on instance variables as whiteboards
to implicitly share data between methods
* "Program with values, not with locations"

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
