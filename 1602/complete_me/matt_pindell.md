Notes:

* Lots of tests - seem to have spent a lot of time on these
* Implementation fairly clear; does follow the algorithm closely
* have a few failing tests on master that need to get cleaned up
* Some of the divisions of methods feel a little arbitrary -- the naming
especially indicates this.
* Mostly want to keep focusing making these divisions more deliberately
and naming them accordingly
* Testing -- provisional 3 assuming we clean up the failing tests for node
* Encapsulation is probably the weaker point of this -- just keep experimenting
with different ways to divide these structures

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
