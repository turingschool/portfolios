Notes:

* Got that simple cov
* good number of tests at first glance
* Suggestion and Selection features all work well
* Code loads the large dictionary fairly quickly
* added substring-specific selection feature
* Good use of skinny CompleteMe class to provide exact
interface into the required methods from spec
* Clean implementation of the algorithm; follows the conceptual
core pretty closely
* A few spots where we could consolidate logic between similar branches
of code
* Play around more with using enums like map to build up a collection rather
than iteratively appending to one
* Tests look straightforward and solid


## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
