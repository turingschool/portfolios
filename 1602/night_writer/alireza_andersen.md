Notes:
* Worried about drift between grades and knowledge. Have mentors help you write more code, and less showing you their solutions

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application follows the complete spec and two extensions
* **3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension**
* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully
* 1: Application only converts to Braille or from Braille

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* **3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.**
* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* **4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration**
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.
* 2: Minor mutations to the implementation code, such as swaping characters, changing `<` to `<=`, placing `true` into a conditional, or deleting a line of code which break the functionality do not cause any tests to fail.
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* **4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage**
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together
