## Notes

* Crammed a lot of conceptual intensity into a small amount of code
* Really getting mileage out of the data structures and the methods that
we know
* Appreciate your ability to speak to and explain the code really thoroughly, and
your keen awareness of the various flaws or gaps
* Testing is ok but really falls into the high level test-last category
* I think more diligent and especially more granular testing up front would help us
work through some of these more intricate methods (and help avoid bugs in them)
* Ruby style is pretty good -- looked at a couple small things like class method invocation
syntax (`.` instead of `::`), ternaries (avoid if more than 15 characters), and variable assignment
inline with method invocation
* Project does basic things pretty well but falls short on some requirements

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
