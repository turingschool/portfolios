Notes: Ran out of time, tests suffered because of that. I didn't feel like the tests were fragile, but there just weren't a lot of them. A few of them were skipped.

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Minor mutations to the implementation code, such as swaping characters, changing `<` to `<=`, placing `true` into a conditional, or deleting a line of code which break the functionality do not cause any tests to fail.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
