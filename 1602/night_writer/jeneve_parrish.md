Notes:

* Application successfully decodes to and from braille.
* four tests.
* Code worked, though it does not account for some edge cases, and
is somewhat brittle.
* Some opportunities for refactoring, methods were overly long.

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2.5:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
