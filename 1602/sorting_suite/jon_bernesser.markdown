## Jon B Sorting Suite Eval

Assessed by: horace

**Notes**

* scoping and when a variable is available in a given context and when to distinguish variables that have the same name in different contexts
* Recommended looking at either the command/query or objects and methods exercises from ruby-exercises
* Bubble sort strays a little from the core concepts of the algorithm; other 2 stay more true
* Testing is good -- good variety of cases and coverage
* code is fairly readable -- luckily not suffering from over-lengthy big methods; however there are
a handful of spots where we take unnecessary steps that make things a little confusing
* recommended going back to bubble sort implementation and re-implementing it to follow the algorithm more closely

## Rubric

### Functional Expectations

* 3: All three sort classes work

### Testing

* 4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases
such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.

### Ruby Style

* 3: Code is a readable and effective implementation of the algorithm. Has fewer than 4 "what on earth is this?" lines of code.

### Organization

* 4: Version control maintains the codebase
