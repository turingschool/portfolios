### Functional Expectations

* **4: All three sort classes work as expected with 2 or more extensions.**
* 3: All three sort classes work as expected
* 2: Two sort classes work as expected
* 1: Zero or one sort classes work as expected

### Testing

* **4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases88
such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.
* 3: Tests cover functionality and demonstrate some escalation of complexity across the examples.
* 2: Sorting suites pass all the examples
* 1: All tests pass and can be ran together with a single command

### Ruby Style

* 4: Any given chunk of code can be understood at a single level of abstraction
* **3: Code is a readable and effective implementation of the algorithm. Has fewer than 4 "what on earth is this?" lines of code.**
* 2: Code runs effectively but has large issues with readability (long methods, confusing
method or variable names, etc)
* 1: There are syntax errors or crashes during execution

### Organization

* **4: Version control maintains the codebase**
* 3: Each sorter class has it's own file in the proper directory and it's own test in the test directory
* 2: A file/directory structure provides basic organization via lib/ and spec/ or /test
* 1: Components work together properly
