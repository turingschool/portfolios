Notes: Consider breaking out gameplay into a separate class. Nice to see messages extracted into
a separate class.

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques and collections

### 3. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations and application includes one or more extensions

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
