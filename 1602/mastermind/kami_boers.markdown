Notes:

* Difficulty levels
* Logic in program is separated into methods very well, jsut needs to take
additional step and pull associated methods out together into modules or classes.
* REPL was pleasant to use. Difficulty levels extensions.
* Very strong effort for first project.


### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques and collections

### 3. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations and application includes one or more extensions

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into logical methods to encapsulate functionality.
