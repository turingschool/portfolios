Notes:

* Program is functional.
* CLI was working but could use some polish.
* There is organization, but some methods could be pulled out into separate classes, and some code
could be moved to their own methods, such as the timer.

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

### 3. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use and application fulfills base expectations from the project spec

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some methods, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.
