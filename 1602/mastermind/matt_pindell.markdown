Notes:

* Interface is clean; like the colors (extension woot)
* executable file with shebang is cool; pull implementation out
of it so the executable is just an interface into the rest of the code
* Enums are well-used and concise
* switching comfortably between string and enumerable constructs
* like the experimentation with modules and monkey-patching; talked about
reasons why these may not necessarily be the best solution in the way they're
being used
* Looked at a couple examples where we could use another dedicated object rather
than leaving things in the main mastermind class
* enums are looking ok but we can still use them to further dissect the problem by
combining multiple enums to solve smaller portions of our problem ("pipelining")
