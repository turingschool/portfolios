Notes:
* 16 runs, 29 assertions
* It encrypts
* it decrypts
* it does not blend
* test should be in separate files, in a test directory
* cracked does not work, small error due to an unclearness in spec
* Some opportunities to refactor out to additional classes and methods.
* Overall, well written code, good project, next time would like to focus on
more division into classes.

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application encrypts, decrypts, and cracks files as described

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
