Notes:
* 32 tests, all pass.
* Application doesn't follow specification, but does encrypt and decrypt.
* Think about how methods and things really just send messages to each other
rather than modifying instance variables.
* File IO not implemented

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
