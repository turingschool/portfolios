Notes: Had node, linked_list and jungle_beat classes. I think there was a little confusion of responsibilities because of the linked_list class. His thought was the linked_list class should have the list responsibilities but the spec refers to jungle beat as the list so the responsibilities are a little mixed. Developer does show an understanding of this concept.  Missing base expectations. Tdd - from what was turned in does not appear to have strong use of tdd. We looked at an old commit and saw much better use, however in a final push to finish the project that work was lost and not turned in. Some long methods and needs refactored. Minor issues with naming variable for what they represent, but generally good. No recursion, good use of loops and understanding of them. Some slight concern with using num times do to wrap loop. 


### 1. Functional Expectations - 1

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension
* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations
* 2: Application is missing one base expectation
* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development - 1

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components - 3

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style - 2

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion - 3

* 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques
* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
* 2: Application has issues with loop/recursion techniques or mixes them inappropriately
* 1: Application struggles to loop/recurse at all
