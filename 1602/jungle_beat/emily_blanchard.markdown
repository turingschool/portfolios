Notes:

__What we have is good, just need to produce more of it__

* Implementation shows a lot of promise -- structure is clear and straightforward
and adheres to the algorithm effectively
* Just need to see more of it -- complete more features, write more tests
* Need to keep adjusting work process to dive into writing stuff more quickly
* Keep up the conceptual sketching / physical demo steps -- those are helpful,
but don't be afraid to just start writing code
* keep in mind that code can be treated as a sketch or a draft -- we can just
try something and if it's no good, commit it on a branch and then go back
* don't forget your pseudocode and tests

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application is missing one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
