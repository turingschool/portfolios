Notes:
* jb - 10 runs, 24 assertions
* list - 8 runs, 25 assertions
* node - 3 tests, 5 assertions
* Clever use of methods, really like how count is calculated.
* The next node method is pretty great.
* Could push some logic from jb to list.
* Testing could use a couple more edge cases.

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
