Notes:
* Non functional program.
* Spent time pairing, there was not much code.


### 1. Functional Expectations

* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 1: Application struggles to loop/recurse at all
