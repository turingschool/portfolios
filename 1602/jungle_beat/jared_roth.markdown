Notes:
* 11 tests.
* one small side case where you cant append to an empty list.
* Needs node tests.
* good traverse method.
* Good use of blocks
* would like to have seen jb and ll split into separate classes.

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques
