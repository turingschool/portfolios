Notes:

* love the deep sonorous voice of the player
* starting to more cleanly grasp conceptual steps involved in each
process
* still dealing some cruft both in the small (i.e. method-level structure) and
in the large (i.e. overall algorithmic proces)
* keep working on pseudocode and outlining our processes -- eventually want to get to
a point where code reads as a clear expression of whatever the outline for a process
would be
* would love to see more of the responsibilities moving into the LInkedList itself (or even
into the nodes) than in the top-level JB object
* like the improvement on iterative processing -- keeping the loops more contained and focused

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
