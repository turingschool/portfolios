Notes: Missing multiple things from base functionality, but was very close. After conversation I think understanding is there. 2.5 on encapsulation because node has too much list responsibility ( append count etc.). 3 for syntax and style. Everything looked good, short methods, some refactoring still needed, but overall great style. Looping and recursion in the project and used effectively. I wonder what this score would have been if the project was completed, but I think programmers understanding of these things is there. 


### 1. Functional Expectations - 1

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension
* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations
* 2: Application is missing one base expectation
* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development - 2

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components - 2.5

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style - 3

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion - 3

* 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques
* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
* 2: Application has issues with loop/recursion techniques or mixes them inappropriately
* 1: Application struggles to loop/recurse at all
