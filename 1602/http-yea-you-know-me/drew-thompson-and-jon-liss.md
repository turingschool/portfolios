## Evaluation Rubric

Evaluator: Andrew

Notes:

* Some poorly names variables
* Opportunities to refactor long methods. Really long case statement
* some leakage of components. Decent split of responsibilities.


The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application implements all five iterations and at least one extension

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.


### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
