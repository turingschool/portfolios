notes:

* Had conversations about refactoring and opportunities to make code cleaner and generally more readable.
* A small bug with going tot he root, but nothing to concerning.
* Able to talk about all the code and it was knowledgable
* Didn't use many enumerables but there were not many opportunities.
* Testing was good. Could have have some more edge cases particularly in taking in the args

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations as tested by the spec harness

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality


### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components


3.5 Application effectively breaks logical components apart

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* 4: Zero complaints
