#### (Mastermind/Flashcards)

* https://github.com/scmountain/mastermind
* https://github.com/scmountain/Flashcards

This is the point in Turing where I thought I was useless. I had no clue what was happening and couldnt even get things started. After a 3am break down and guidance from instructors, I was to work to get my confidence

#### 1. Functional Expectations
* **3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.**

#### 2. Test-Driven Development
* **3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.**

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### (Enigma)

* https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1611-b/1module/enigma/greg_spencer.markdown
* https://github.com/scmountain/Enigma.git


Notes:

Functionality in place for all three functions, but project broke with some last-minute merge issues
Testing suite has good content, but many test broken due to merge issue.
Ruby style solid. Some additional opportunities to refactor, but strong work in many classes
Clear division of responsibilities across classes and methods

#### 1. Overall Functionality
* **1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage**

#### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* **3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.**

#### 3. Test-Driven Development
* **2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.**

#### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* **4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage**

From Greg, Thank you for your help on enigma, I really appreciated your willingness
to work long hours on getting the coding correct.  I think you took some
of the harder parts of the project on yourself and we probably should have redistributed
the work once we discovered the actually scope, so it might be helpful in the future to
make sure your partner is aware when the scope broadens and
rework the distribution so that it gets handled equally.  I think you coding
was done very well and I appreciate how accommodating you were of my schedule
and inability to stay after class.  It was a pleasure working with you.

Learning how to write a resume for the tech world was a whole new concept! also trying to shape past experiences for this tech world was a differnt thought process

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

First weeks when our cohort was finding it’s groove and people were still feeling each other out, there was Spencer readily making jokes and helping bring us together.  He played a large part in developing and maintaining our group cohesiveness.  He’s made it clear through his behavior that his mindset is one of equality.  No person is greater or less than another.  He happily welcomes engagement with anyone he comes into contact with.  I’ve not made the opportunity to work with Spencer on technical problems; however, he is a continual shining example of how people should treat each other.  The Turing community prides itself on such behavior, and our community at-large and the 1611 cohort benefit from having him as a member.  Spencer, if your personality and how you treat people never changes, that would be a great thing. - Andy Wooten

Spencer, when I first met you I remember thinking how gregarious and funny you are to talk to. You always add such a lightened spirit to the cohort and I appreciate that I could turn to you for emotional support when things felt overwhelming. You really enhanced my understanding of growth mindset and grit during the grit Gear Up, and I think your experience here has helped you develop even more of a growth mindset. Specifically, while you struggled through a couple of projects, you kept pushing and exercising your growth mindset, which is something that inspired me and others in the cohort. I appreciate how you never hesitated to ask questions in class and that you were an example of strong work ethic for everyone. Knowing that you are probably up late working and struggling while I am gives me a sense of camaraderie and helps me keep working in the moment. I'm really glad I got to know you, and I hope we get to pair in the future. - Courtney Meyerhofer

### Playing a Part
I supported the Turing community in many ways this cohort, both my cohort, and the community at large.
First I supported my cohort by showing up every day on time and ready to rock and roll! I also made an effort to be engaged with the class discussion and lectures by always adding my thoughts and never hesitating to ask questions. I always put myself out there to help others with code or life! I took several walks with different members to "talk them off the ledge."

 Besides the aboeve mention personality traints, my contributions to the overall Turing community were large! First and foremost Annie and I fixed the 3d printer it took us over 3 hours, but it works now*. *must know what youre doing!

Next, I made the effort to load/unlod a dishwasher minimum once a week. Cleanlieness and order are crucial to maintaining sanity, and helping the creative mind. I also attened any lunch roulette that materialized, and invited those who didnt have one to mine.

I feel that my contributions in the classroom and to the community have only continued to make Turing a better place!

# Cohort norms


What actions do you want to take for yourself and your cohort to be successful at Turing?
I will fully commit to being a student and work as hard as humanly possible to become an exceptional developer. In addition, I will further contribute to the Turing community, hopefully in such a way that I can become a prominent figure within the community. 

How can you leverage your place on the spectrum of introversion/extroversion to impact your career in the future?
Given that I am rather high on the extroversion spectrum, I know that one of my key strengths moving forward will be my ability to effectively communicate with others. In addition, given that I tend to have a more outgoing nature, I will likely take on the leadership role in many situations, which can be a very powerful position if capitalized upon in a transformational manner. 

How do you think you're perceived by those who don't share this same working style?
To others who are either lower on the extrovert scale or tend more towards introversion, I can be perceived as a bit loud and sometimes annoying. However, by acknowledging that there are different personality types in the world, I am able to dial back the intensity of my extroversion when necessary. 

How to work with an extrovert? 
Extroverts enjoy communicating with others and creating new relationships. To best get along with an extrovert, converse over an interesting, attention-grabbing topic and be patient with them, as sometimes they will possess a great amount of energy when the time is not right. 


# Growth Mindset


What are your triggers, what's likely to move you to fixed mindset? 
 
Raised in a family of all athletes, competition has been my life as long as I have known it. Therefore, I have noticed that my competitive spirit can sometimes get the better of me. However, in an environment such as Turing, I have been able to utilize this mindset in a healthy way by competing with my most recent personal best during every new project. 

What can your peers do to support your growth mindset?

Let's make this a team effort, of Turing vs the “other schools/ job markets,” how can you support each other in creating a cohort culture that supports growth mindset?
If you have nothing nice to say, keep it to yourself
 
# Personal Narrative


What brought you here?
I chose to pursue coding at Turing as the knowledge that I will gain here provides me with a foundation which I can utilize in a technologically driven world. As the global interconnectivity continues to increase, I believe that the skillset that I gain here, at Turing, will allow me to travel the world while working.


What are the values that drive you?
Honesty, empathy, and the determination to get the job done the right way the first time. 

How do you think you demonstrate those values to people around you? 
I try to embody these characteristics in every facet of my life, whether it be in my personal relationships or professional relationships. I stand firmly by the ideology “actions speak louder than words,” and I try to exhibit these traits in my life on a daily basis through every action that I take. 

How do you think these differences/similarities will impact your cohort?
As we enter into higher modules, I am sure that the learning curve will only grow steeper and the grind will grow tougher. However, between my extroverted nature and my enduring determination, I intend to serve my cohorts as a leader, bringing through the tough times that lie ahead. In addition, I intend to be a loyal and honest friend that fellow cohort members enjoy being around, while contributing to the knowledge pool.

# Retrospection
When I look back at mod 1, all I can do is laugh at myself! I came in so cocky that the first three weeks were wasted on me I knew most of the material, or so I thought. I was not a student, but merely a participant. This wasn’t all bad as it really helped me become a part of the Turing social community! I made connections outside of the classroom that I relied on heavily later. Grade for the first month at turing is a 1.999

It wasn’t until Battleship that I was hit by the ego freight train
As much as this hurt I needed this. The fire that was lit underneath me was intense, I went from being able to enjoy weekends with my friends at home, to now I have about ten loads of laundry at my house, no food in the cupboards, no Vitamin D in my body, the whole Turing works!
This is because I spend every waking hour “on the Keys!” From these hours there has been GREAT improvement. All three of my mentors have commented on my growth, I am very proud of this but understand, it is not done yet!
