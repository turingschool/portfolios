-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment
While I'm still a bit slow on the uptake, grasping and understanding the fundamentals of JS have been much improved this time around. The single largest challenge for me what how the mod flew by so fast; I found it difficult to keep everything in order and on track. Being my second time around this block, I was still able to focus on the things I really needed to improve on. CSS, however, still alludes me and I'd feel content to let it were it not such an important facet of a front end developer. Overall the challenge has been real and I hope to continue to improve on that which I've learned, but most importantly, learn how to more efficiently grasp the material being passed to me. That, I think, has been just about the most challenging aspect of all.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The first assigned project proved a helpful introduction to basic JavaScript, CSS and HTML structures and work flow practice.

Initial - This did not pass the assessment -- it was incomplete and very much in process. We would like for you to complete this comp over the coming days and finish it. Resubmit by Tuesday morning 03/07 at 9:00 for regrading. Your passing the mod is contingent on refactoring static comp 3 for a passing score.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
(Intro)
I have participated in several paired projects. In each I found the workflow and partner cohesion increasing in effectiveness.


#### (Linked List)

* [GitHub URL](https://buji405.github.io/linked-list/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

(description)
Easily the best paired project. My partner and I both work together quite nicely. Being the more experienced student, I was able to speak out what I was doing and why. I was able to effectively help my partner troubleshoot broken pieces of code and show her how to go about looking for the answers by filtering through docs and the almighty internet (blessed be it's name). But it wasn't a one way conversation, Ciara was perfectly willing to stop me and ask questions, have me re-explain something, or just tell me to slow down. We communicated well and I'm certain that our score was very much OUR score. I wouldn't have done nearly so well by myself.

(evaluation scores)
* 3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring. Definitely some refactoring here (overwriting variables not needed...)
* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.
* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

(description)
This went very much the same as the first paired project. My partner and I both work together quite nicely. Being the more experienced student, I was able to speak out what I was doing and why. I was able to effectively help my partner troubleshoot broken pieces of code and show her how to go about looking for the answers by filtering through docs and the almighty internet (blessed be it's name). But it wasn't a one way conversation, Nic was perfectly willing to stop me and ask questions, have me re-explain something, or just tell me to slow down. We communicated well and I'm certain that our score was very much OUR score. I wouldn't have done nearly so well by myself.

(evaluation scores)
* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
* 3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

(description)
During this project we had to refactor the Idea Box project from another student. As for being paired with people, this was the most challenging of the three. Where, in all previous pairings, my partner and I were able to work through any minor (if any) conflicts with hardly more than a hiccup. That wasn't the case here. Try as I may to work well together effectively, Karen and I just couldn't. The tactics employed in all previous projects seemed to have little effect and in one circumstance, backfired. I'm not sure what I learned from the situation. It's unlike any I've encountered before. I do feel confident, though, that had I not pushed my partner as I did, we would not have scored as well as we did. When I made it clear in the prior two projects that it was "our project", I don't feel it would be fair to claim that this time. By no means was it mine alone, a larger portion of the code was authored by Karen than she might admit to. It really came down to the refactoring process, or requiring best practice methods as a way to help instill good habits in both her and I. That's when the turmoil began. Her misgivings, were, to the best of my ability, already being addressed so that we would avoid them. I guess it boils down to poor communication?

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from phases 1 through 4 that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
* 3 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 3 - Project has a running test suite but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.
* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

##### Debugging The Gender Gap

(takeaways from session)
* This might have been the most enlightening of all of the Gear Ups. As a white American, blue eyed male, I'm aware of the inherent privileges that come with the package. But simply being aware is seldom enough to constitute a fair and realistic point of view. I felt that the video provided a well balanced approach to the topic.

##### Growth Mindset

(takeaways from session)
* Everyone is talking about it! Every time someone in the coding community gives a talk, Carol Dweck comes into the conversation. It's all the rage. And, to be fair, it's for a good reason. I've always wholeheartedly agreed with her point of view. Though, I do still think that there's some validity to the old adage "you can't teach an old dog new tricks". The caveat is in the work "can't". I would rather rephrase it as "you CAN teach an old dog new tricks, it's just harder now". But learning can still happen. At least I have to believe that if I want to continue moving forward in this intimidating new world.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

* Jon W. - He has always been ready and willing to pull away from his code whenever I've asked him for assistance with my own. I always felt as though I could interrupt him while he's neck deep in his own code-quagmire without any kind of negative response. Neither has he ever been afraid to say no if he needs to, though that has been a rare occurrence. His character and attitude is one that any student can look up to (myself included) as an example of what one should expect in a fellow student, pair-partner and friend. I would recommend him for a raise but we don't get paid so I won't.

* Devon B. - You, sir, are one hell of a hard worker. You're drive is enviable. I'm impressed by your keen interest and desire for proficiency. Being a repeat offender here at Turing, I am keenly aware of the absolute need to keep up a positive attitude and progressive mindset. Considering these traits you've been someone I can look up to. However! While your drive is impressive, you do need balance our some aspects and spend more time sleeping, for starters. I've witnessed the detrimental affects of this first hand at a very important period of time. Sleep, dude. Do yourself a favor. And keep up the good work.

### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me)
* Ciara B. - You did a great job of making things easier to understand and were very patient with helping me and walking me through concepts and checking in to make sure you weren't going too fast. I also appreciated that you respected that I wanted to do all the JS together so I gained a lot in that project. you were really patient with me and it was great that you were always thinking of new ways to try something new. You were willing to keep pushing on even when some things weren't going as planned and it all worked out! I also felt like you did a good job of slowing down and letting me explain it back if you started working on something more advanced. I learned a lot working with you!

* Karen K. - Work on listening to your pairing partner, even if it means stopping work and closing your computer. If you are going to make a bunch of changes to the code, talk to your pair before you make the changes instead of after.  Once the changes are made and the code still works, most people won't say just throw away your work.  Asking for forgiveness instead of permission is not really a trust building exercise in this case.


### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
* Being a repeat offender, I was able to help alleviate some of the weight of the sudden onslaught of information by hosting a couple lunch session Macbook keyboard shortcuts. And I'm always willing to set aside what I'm doing to help out my classmates.
