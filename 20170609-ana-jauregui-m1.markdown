## Areas of Emphasis

Besides successfully making it through Mod 1. My goals for this module were to gain a solid understanding of all the material that was presented throughout, and be able to implement the concepts comfortably through my work. I feel proud of my accomplishments throughout the mod and the growth I have experienced from the start to now, and look forward to continued growth and being able to solidify the key concepts I have learned. Moving forward I would like to work on building confidence in my skills and ideas and become more comfortable displaying my capabilities.

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

#### Project Description:

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. The game should have an input for guessing a number, and 2 more inputs for changing the min/max number range. It should have 2 buttons, one for submitting a guess, and another for clearing the guess input. When a guess is submitted, the game should provide feedback that the guessed number is either too low, too high, or guessed correctly. The submit button should be disabled and only become enabled when a valid guess has been entered into the guess input field. After each correct guess, the min/max number range should expand by 10 in both directions.

### 2DoBox Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/anajauregui/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

#### Project Description:

This project involved a pivot on a previous project (the IdeaBox). We were given another team's code base and our goals were to refactor the code base and fix any broken functionality and add any missing functionality from the original specifications. In addition, there were new pieces of functionality to be implemented. This application allowed us to practice using jQuery and javascript for logic and DOM manipulation, and the use of JSON/LocalStorage. We also got to hone our skills in shortening our code, and finding alternative solutions to make our code more concise. This project was developed for a class at the Turing School of Software and Design.

The application is a to-do-list, where a user can create tasks to be completed, and they will be appended to the site. Upon clicking the Save button, a new task card is generated that contains the information for the new "to-do". One can then click various buttons to change the importance level of the task, to mark it as completed, or to remove the task from the page (and local Storage). The page shows only the ten most recent tasks upon page load, but the user has the option to view more tasks by clicking the "Show More Tasks" button and the remaining tasks will be loaded to the page. The user can also view only completed tasks by clicking on the "Show Completed Tasks" button. There are five buttons corresponding with importance levels that will display only tasks of relevant importance. Lastly, there is a search bar available for the user to filter through various tasks.

#### Feedback to me:
Ana, I really enjoyed working on this project with you. I thought we had a nice balance of pairing together with driver-navigator style, and also working on separate features through alternate branches when needed. It was nice that we talked through our goals for the project at the beginning, and even though we were a little over-confident at first (that the project would be easier), I'm glad we were able to overcome those hurdles (ie: search bar functionality). The only suggestion I have would be to try to maintain a little more positivity when hitting a hurdle or getting stuck on a problem, as in the beginning, I felt a little bit of hesitation and resignation on your part that we would not be able to fix the problem, specifically the search functionality, and the minor issues with javascript functionality that cropped up after I re-factored all the CSS styles. I was also very aware that we both have strong personalities so I actually really liked that we had some disagreements, and talked our way through them to try to do what was best for everyone. I really appreciated your directness and honesty in stopping me if you needed more explanation or if something was unclear, because I sometimes have the tendency to just rush through things (steamroll others) and I am trying to work on that issue. But your speaking up, made it much easier for me to stop for a moment and take the time to make sure both of us understood exactly what was going on. I liked that we both took the time to explain specific functionality of pieces of the project that we had worked on separately. Overall, I thought the project went really well, and I'm happy to have had the opportunity to work with you.

### Idea-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/EndlessHypnosis/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

#### Project description:
This project was to build a webpage with an input section at the top, and a section below where new ideas can be added to a list. Each idea should have a unique identifier, a title, body, quality level with up/down vote buttons, and a delete button. All ideas should remain on the page after a page refresh, deleted ideas should not come back after page refresh, and edited an edited title/body/quality should persist between page refreshes.

The project incorporated local storage use. We had to use our HTML, CSS, and jQuery/JS knowledge to build a dynamic list where we could enter ideas. Each idea would have an editable title and body, a quality level, and the ability to delete ideas. Ideas should also be added to localStorage and persist through page refreshes.

#### Evaluator: Louisa
#### Notes:
*Worked well together, paired most of the project
*nicely done HTML and CSS, solid implementation
*ideaBuilder, the Mega Function! Have some functions that are pretty long, could use a refactor pass to make things a bit more concise. In a great place to dig in and refactor.

#### Feedback to me:
Ana, it was such a pleasure working with you on Idea Box. I think we worked well to establish our relationship and our working schedule. Throughout the project, I really saw not only your dedication to the project, but also how much you're starting to grasp the concepts. Your css and html skills are very impressive, and it seems like javascript is starting to make sense. Honestly, I can't come up with any criticisms about how the project went, or your involvement in our partnership. I will however, leave you with two areas within javascript that I feel you could get a little stronger. By practicing these areas outside of a large project, it could really help you prep for the pentathlon. The first area is understanding variable scope and calling functions that have parameters, and when to use local vs. global variables within those functions. And lastly, just practicing DOM manipulation. Create a few nested HTML controls, and use functions such as 'closest' and 'siblings' to identify elements on the DOM. Anyway, I look forward to continuing this journey with you in my cohort and hope we get a chance to work together again!

### Linked-List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rburnette3/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

#### Project Description:

The project of Linked List was the first paired project of 1705 front end. The concept behind this project is the basic storage of web links on a page for later reference. The User is prompted to enter a website title and a Url in the input boxes and then by pushing the enter button a card is generated in the stored links section containing this info. If the user does not properly fill out the input fields they will be notified by a pop up message. Once the links are stored the user can click the link to visit the page, mark as read or delete all together. there is a separate button that will also clear out all the "read" links from the stored section. A counter is located at the bottom of the page which will track how many links are currently stored as well as the number of "read" links. the page is fully responsive operating the same on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### Feedback to me:
I wanted to let you know I really enjoyed working with you on our Linked-List project.  I am very happy with how we established our approach to completing everything from the get go with our DTR.  You did an outstanding job creating the HTML and CSS.  Working on this project with you I felt as though I walked away with a much better understanding with thinking through the logic in our Javascript as well as a much more solid grasp on writing Jquery.  If I could offer some advice I would encourage you to speak up with your ideas and talk through the logic you have running through your mind even more so than you already do.  This is something that has helped me TREMENDOUSLY since the last mod with getting past roadblocks.  Thank you so much for all of your help on this project I look forward to working with you again on future projects.

## D: Professional Skills
Although I felt like our gear ups and professional development sessions were just one more thing to worry about while we were all feeling swamped by our work, I did find all the information and discussions helpful and relavent to what we were experiencing as students at Turing, its a good way to break away from the coding a bit and connect with other students in mod-1. 

### Gear Up
#### 1) Growth Mindset: 
I found this gear up to be incredibly interesting! I think myself and most of my peers grew up with the mentality of a fixed midset, and as this growth mindset was introduced to us it was interseting to hear the different view points surrounding the topic. I belive that this was a very valuable lesson to start off at Turing, this theme has been one that has been resonating with me throughout the course of Mod 1. I am constantly reminding myself of the open growth midset that is imperative to get through this chapter at Turing. I will continue to practice implementing having a growth midset in my life. As it was also mentioned, as much as I would like to believe that I now always have a growth mindset, it is nearly impossible not to bounce between a fixed and growth mindset if not staying in a fixed mindset all the time. 

#### 2) Getting Better at Difficult Things
This theme of getting better at difficult things is another theme that has been echoing to me throught Mod 1. I am learning to cope with my struggle at learning some extremely complex material that is completely foreign to me at such a fast pace. I am extremely determined to succeed at this journey I have set out on to become a proficient FE Web Developer. I found it interesting how cogintive resources were presented during this session. I have undoubtedly wasted many cognitive resources spinning my wheels and worrying about not picking things up quick enough and that is a habbit that in order to be successful with a growth mindset I will need to nip. To learn more I am seeking out as many high quality examples as I can, and because I realize that my own fear of struggles and failure impede me from being my very best I am working on being verbal about those concerns and pushing them aside. Also instead of trying to learn everything that is presented to me at once I am working on really simplifying the whole puzzle into smaller managable pieces of information that I can feel comfortable with and fully digest.

#### 3) Working with Introverts, Extroverts, and Ambiverts
I was surprised by this session when we categorized ourselves as introverts, extroverts or ambiverts, I saw some people put themselves in categories other than what I would have described him/her as. I see myself on the farther end of the introvert spectrum, what may be considered an ambivert. Through this session and grouping with some of the extroverts in the room I was able to get a better understanding of what they tend to need in a working environment and was able to share some of the misconceptions I believe extroverts sometimes may have about introverts. This new found perspective helped me to work better in my next group project with someone who is far on the other end of the spectrum from me. I belive being able to hear the reality of what each group experiences or how we work together was a tool for success for both me and my partner in our new working environment. 

#### 4) Strengths and Storytelling
I do believe that our lives are an ever building story, and being able to share that story is rather important. Through stories we relate to others and gain new perspectives that help us build relationships. More importantly right now in my journey as a student at Turing is to live my story out and share that story through my work and progress, so I am continually looking forward to the next little chunk I can add to my story. 

#### 5) Code Debugging the Gender Gap
I really enjoyed watching this documentary. Although it was disheartening to learn about the real problem with such an enormous gender gap in the tech world, it really got my wheels spinning and motivated me to want to make a change as a female entering the tech industry. I want to be part of the movement that I feel is emerging to change the bias. I think being able to set an example and changing the standard in tech is of critical importance. I would like to work hard to be the very best I can be and through my work help and inspire other women with an interest in web development. I strongly believe that diversity on any team especially any team producing a a service or a product is crucial to produce something worth being consumed.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Throughout this Mod I played a part in the Turing community as a fully active participant, by attending guest speakers, spikes and other community events. In my attempts to balance my work load and be successful as a student I did not take on any extra roles to lead any events in the community. However, I did engage with students in my cohort to offer assistance when and where I could, and offered constructive feedback to my peers, as well as doing my part to take feedback which was given to me and make changes towards personal growth.
