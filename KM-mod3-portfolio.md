# JF Lalonde - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> This module I wanted to get a good solid base for CSS, HTML, and Javascript, Jquery, and unit testing. I feel that I have the suffecient knowledge in all of these areas to move forward into module 2.

>* The word that I would use to describe this module would be overwhelming. Between settling into denver, to the constant pressure caused by constantly having something to work on, I definitley stayed busy. I don't feel like it was necessarily bad stress however, I think that knowing that I'm moving forward is worth it. 
>* I would like to get more comfortable with the javascript/jquery syntax. Usually I am able to find solutions to problems fairly easily using the docs, but this can also be time -consuming. I assume that this is something that will alaso come with practice.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[Number Guesser](https://github.com/kmarler2/number-guesser-final)**
>* Number Guesser was a program which generated a random number, then compared a user's input to that number.
>* This project was not too hard as far as complexity, but it was definitley a challenge because I had never really built a program before, and had no partner to get additional input and support on various issues I ran into with this project. 


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Idea box](https://github.com/kmarler2/idea-box)**
>* Idea box took user inputs, stored it in local data, and displayed it on the webpage.
>* A lot of idea box was similar to linked list in theory. We ended up using jquery, which was a little challenging for me since I had just begun to grasp it. It was also a challenge to find and solve all of the problems caused by putting data into local storage. 

> **[Linked List](https://github.com/kmarler2/linked-list)**
>* Linked list basically took in a user's input and made them into bookmarks.
>* This project wasn't too bad as far as complexity, but did take some time to get everything working properly and to fix some small bugs we had.

> **[2 Do Box Pivot](https://github.com/kmarler2/2DoBox-Pivot)**
>* 2 do box pivot was basically jiust refactoring someone else's codde from idea box and refactoring it into a different program
>* I think this was my favorite project of the mod. It was fun to go through someone else's code and see what they did in their project in contrast to what I did. I also enjoyed the fact that we were able to reuse the code in such a way that the application was completely different, yet the amount of code we actually had to change was fairly small.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Getting Better at Difficult Things]((https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md))
This gear up covered the fact the what we are learning here at Turing is really hard, but learning the material will be worth it. Most of the time things that take time to learn are an investment in terms of time and brainpower, but are often pretty profitable in our livesa dn also build character.

> [Working Styles](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)
This gear up showed me that even though many of us here are working on similar things, that doesn't mean that we will all be working at the same pace, have the same approach, or acheive the same results. I thought it also tied in well with working with partners as well as with the 2-do-box-pivot project.

> [Managing stress and coping mechanisms](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)
This gear up covered stress management techniques as well as reasons behind stress, and dropping negative or unnecessary stress. For me this is a very important concept, because I have fairly severe ADHD and if I get overly stresssed without using stress management techniques such as exercise, I become very disorganized and forgetful. 

> [](> [Personal Stories and Connection](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)
This gear up covered techniques of opening ourselves up to others as well as being good listeners to other's stories. I think that this is an incredibly important concept, and is one of the most vital skills needed to really fit into any given community. 

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* I participated in the optional SAB events, went out with mod 1 and mod 2 students after several class several times, and also attended the easley posse on several occasions. I also ended up pairing a lot(3-5 times per week ) in the last couple weeks of the mod, so made a couple friends from mod 2 from that as well.
