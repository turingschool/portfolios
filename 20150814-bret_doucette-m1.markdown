### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Chisel Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bad6e/Chisel_Project)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

In this week long project we used Ruby to build a markdown to HTML parser that could parse the following:

* `paragraphs`
* `headers`
* `lists` - unordered/ordered
* `strong tags`
* `em tags`

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 2
* Functionality: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

* Good functionality
* Good starting direction for tests; push them further
* Implementation is good but some spots would benefit from refactoring
* Make sure you don't rely too much on mentors
* Look for opportunities to test edge cases and integrations

#### Linked Lists

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bad6e/Linked_Lists)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown)

In this three day project we used Ruby to implement a singly linked list data structure with the following functionality:

* `append`
* `prepend`
* `insert`
* `includes?`
* `pop`
* `count`
* `return the head`
* `return the tail`
* `find_by_index`
* `find_by_value`
* `remove_by_index`
* `remove_by_value`

* Good use of raises
* Some opportunities for refactoring using built methods to assist
previous methods.
* Note to Bret - Use While
* did only iterative

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping / Recursion: 3

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bad6e/Enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

This was a week long project where we used Ruby to build an alogrithm for encrypting/decrypting text files. In addition, we also built a tool for cracking our encrypted text files.

* Rakefile runs all the tests
* 66 tests all passing
* Seeing good decomposition from the tests
* Testing is overall good progress, some gaps, some repetition, some unnecessary tests
* Lots of good parts in the implementation, some rough spots,
* some naming weaknesses make the code difficult to understand
* Some repetition in classes despite good decompositionomments)

* Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
