# Gavin Love - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

It was my goal this mod to establish a solid foundation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to be able to understand how and when to implement certain code. I also wanted to learn best practices that will help set me apart in my future career. The biggest thing for me this mod was to front-load projects and studying as much as possible and stay focused. I learned a lot and I am very happy with my progress. My goal over the break and into next mod it to pratice array prototypes daily and continue to work hard so that I may help my peers. Next mod I will continue to improve on time boxing.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individuals projects consisted of one javascript project Number Guesser and 3 static comp HTML/CSS projects. 

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gavin-love/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was an introduction to vnailla javascript. The concept is a webpage that users guess a number between 0 to 100, compared to a random number. The game will let users know if the guess is too high, too low, or spot on.

#### Static Comp One

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gavin-love/gl-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This project was to reacreate a static comp useing HTMl and CSS. We were given liberty to chang the look but the overall design would remain the same and the site needed to be responsive. 
    
#### Static Comp Two

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gavin-love/gl-static-comp-2-challenge)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This project was to reacreate a static comp useing HTMl and CSS. We were given liberty to chang the look but the overall design would remain the same and the site needed to be responsive.

#### Static Comp Three

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gavin-love/gl-static-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

This project was to reacreate a static comp useing HTMl and CSS. We were given liberty to chang the look but the overall design would remain the same and the site needed to be responsive.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

In this mod we focused on vanilla JavaScript, as well as, Jquery to create lists that were appended/prepended to the page when user submitted information on a form, the information is stored in the local storage to persist on page reload. These projects required event delgation to taeget the DOM and array prototypes to manipulate local storage.

#### (Linked-List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tdberg21/linked-list-project)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked-list was an introduction to jQuery. With this website users can create bookmark links to sites that they want to visit at a later date. Users can mark the bookmarks as read and delete them when needed.

 ## feedback to me:
    I really enjoyed working with you on this project and think that we worked really well together. I appreciate that you always kept us guided in the right direction but always let me try out my ideas and made sure that I understood what was going on. We communicated really well throughout our work. The only issue with our communication was that I had an image saved locally on my computer instead of in the project file so it always worked on my computer but apparently never worked on your computer, but it was never brought up until evals, so there was a disconnect in communication there. Overall the project was definitely a success. I look forward to working with you again soon.

#### (Idea-Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gavin-love/idea-box-backup)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Idea-Box used jQuery and local storage. With this website users can create a list of ideas that are stored in local storage. Users can mark the list as complete, edit them, and delete them when needed.

 ## feedback to me:
    Gavin, working with you on Idea box was a real pleasure.  The time we spent on that project solidified many aspects of Javascript for me.  I really appreciated the approach you took of talking out the logic and answering any questions with me and taking the reigns writing the code.  It was enjoyable to watch the logic be but into functional code.  That approach is congruent to my learning process.  For me I can not make any suggestion that would have made the pairing better for my learning style.  Others though may want to "drive" more then I did for this project. Working with you really helped me turn the corner with Javascript, thank you.
    
#### (2Do-Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gavin-love/idea-box-backup)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

 This project we inherited a repo from another student and converted it into 2-do-box. The idea was to refactor the code witout completely changing it and bring functionality up to par with the assignment requirments. We used jquery, event delegation, and array prototypes to collect the information. The refactor consisted of eliminating global variables, creating single use functions, as well as, eliminating nested if/else statements.

 ## feedback to me:
    Never had to doubt his devotion to getting the project done, or his willingness to help me understand his ideas. You might consider using more patience with classmates in future pairings, as they are tired and stressed as well. Timing was less than ideal but as a team we were able to make it work and produce a fine project.


## D: Professional Skills
This mod, we learned ways to manage stress, work with people who have varying personality types (introvert/extravert), understand how severe the gender gap is in programming, and developing a growth mindset. I can do this!

### Gear Up
## (Mental Health 101)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

Our first session was related to dealing with stress. I really absorbed the information this mod and have found ways to make time to take care of my body and mind. I've realized that project intensity has a different kind of stress that requires extra attention and understanding. I continue to take time to rest my mind and body. Next mod I will stay focused on stressers, when my body is letting me know that I need to take a step back. Celebrate the micro victories!

## (Debugggin the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

Our second session was related to the gender gap in coding and all other industries. I truly never understood the discrimination that women face. I have never worked in a place where these things happend or they at least were not made noticable if they were happening. I have always treated women with respect and have never seen them as less in any way. I will continue to support women and advocate for them as I move through school and into my career.

## (Mindfulness)

Our third session was related to stress and exerciseing mindfulness. I really enjoyed this sessions because anxiety is something that I have always dealt with and I was able to provide a lot of insight to my classmates. Taking a step back and focusing on the moment is key but also hard to do without practice. As I move forward in to mod 2 I will be blocking out time in the morning and the afternoon to meditate.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I supported the over-all community by participating in community events and being here for others. My main focus in being a part of the community was making myself available to teach others. I also run a study group on Saturday's called Skylab FE, we meet off campus in the penthouse (with a nice view of the mountains) area of my complex and study from 10am-4pm.
