# DJ Greenfield - Module 4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Previous to this module my project management skills had seriously decayed. A
large focus for each project was keeping a clean and organized waffle card, an
active private Slack channel for each project, serious consistent code review,
and Google Calendar for deadlines. I made serious efforts to accomplish this
by being frank with my project-mates and patient with my projects.

### End of Module Assessment

My progress through the module was assessed by Josh Cheek and here are the
results:

"We did a nice refactoring where we moved logic into a state machine."

**Note: the assessment took 3 hours.**

* Satisfactory progress 3
* Ruby styniax and style 3
* Rails style and api 3
* Testing 3.5
* User interface 3

### Attendance

Like all modules before it, I attended each day. I had two tardies, one on
Tuesday, June 16th and one on Wednesday, June 24th.

### Projects

I completed the following individual project for this module:

#### Idea Box 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/allpurposename/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

  In this four-day project I implemented the bare essentials of Idea Box in
  JavaScript. I was peer evaluated by Richard and Paul with these generous
  results:

  "Code and testing looks good!"

  * Features:  3
  * User Interface: 2
  * Rails Style: 3
  * Ruby Style: 4
  * JavaScript Style: 3

## Team

### Projects

  I participated in the following team projects:

#### Scale Up (HubStub)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/HubStub)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)

  This two week long project utilized a previous cohort's Pivot project and a seed
  data of ~1 million objects to help us experience harsh load times and a need for
  optimization. Our project was evaluated by Horace with the following results:

  "Nice handling of poorly scoped ActiveRecord queries."

  * Production Performance: 1 -- not running in production
  * Load Testing: 2
  * DB Scale: Check
  * Testing: 2
  * Code Quality: 2
  * Additional Features: 2

##### My Contribution

  I wrote the entirety of the Capybara load testing script. I also refactored
  sloppy hard-to-work-with scoping so the rest of the team could focus on writing
  better ActiveRecord queries.

##### Takeaway

  * Inheriting code is awful
  * Large data sets are managable
  * Writing scripts is fun

#### Game Time (Lights Out)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mirjoy/lights-out)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

  This week-and-a-half long project was a pure JavaScript implementation of a
  simple game. In our case that game was Lights Out. It was evaluated by Horace
  with the following results:

  "This is actually fun."

  * Functional Expectations 3-
  * Test-Driven Development 2
  * Breaking Logic into Components 3
  * Fundamental JavaScript & Style 3

##### My Contribution

  We did not split the responsibilities and made sure to each take full responsiblity
  for every aspect of the project. If I did have a focus, it was writing the tests
  and keeping us on a TDD track.

##### Takeaway

  * OO JS is just a matter of organization
  * TDD is mostly self discipline
  * Project management tools are useful even in a team of two

#### Flack (Quibble)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/indiesquidge/quibble)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flack.markdown)

  This two week mastery project was a demonstration of websockets and software as
  a service through a Slack clone. Our particular project aimed to provide a
  structure for groups to come to decisions. We were evaluated by Horace with the
  following results:

  * Services 2:
  * Encapsulation 2:
  * Rails MVC 3:
  * Test-Driven Development 2:
  * Deployment 3:
  * Features 3:
  * Interface 3:
  * Concept 3:
  * Project Management process 3:

##### My Contribution

  I was the primary Rails developer on this project and I spent a lot of time
  TDDing and making sure we had a great foundation. I also implemented a few Rails
  features solely for the benefit of the other developers which felt like a great
  use of time. Additionally, I was the team member who troubleshot miscellaneous
  problems with the various integration of our code.

##### Takeaway

  * Code review is key to writing great software
  * Being the team member who touches everything forces you to keep a lot in your
  head at once.
  * Pick your battles. Let some design decisions go.

### Playing a Part

  Throughout the six weeks I pushed myself to pair with as many other students as
  I could. I attended and advocated for every DSA session during the six weeks.

  * On Friday, May 22nd, I delivered a lightning talk titled "Metaprogramming is
  Meta cool!"
  * On Tuesday, June 9th, I delivered an expanded version of my metaprogramming
  lightning talk at the Denver.rb beginner's track
  * On Friday, June 12th, I ran a student lead session on JavaScript for Rubyists
  * On Thrusday, June 18th, I delivered the metaprogramming lightning talk at
  Community Night
  * On Thursay, June 25th, I wrote a blog post titled "The Turing Bar" which was
  featured on turing.io
