## Notes

* 125 tests
* sweet bash snippet to run tests
* completed I0 - I4
* overall structure is good; got good relationships; using repos to find appropriate data where needed
* generally could be more consistent about leveraging the relationships we have already constructed;
frequently we end up re-constructing a relationship from a different method
* handful of ruby style nitpicks here and there -- unnecessary local variable creation and
unnecessary explicit boolean values
* analysis is pretty successful at leveraging existing relationships and record-level methods; keep
pushing on these fronts to get as much logic as we can down into the record / model layer
* most analysis methods are pretty clean and concise; don't be afraid to extract more helper
methods when these start to get longer

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
