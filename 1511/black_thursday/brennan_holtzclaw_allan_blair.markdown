## Notes
* small well encapsulated classes 
* good test coverage, though performance and line hits could be improved either by use of fixtures or some minor refactoring
* nice use of ruby Math & Date Time utilities to not reinvent the wheel 
* documentation inside of tests!!!!
* had a nice discussion about variables & garbage collection (though I understand why we were creating vars to save on line length) 
* good understand of relation between objects 
* extension: coupons

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, (4 or 5), and features of your own design


### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* 
### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
