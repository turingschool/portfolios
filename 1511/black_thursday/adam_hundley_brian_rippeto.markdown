## Notes

* so many tests
* completion through I4
* great analysis code; could still be improved by pushing more of the
graph traversal logic and various query methods into the individual record objects
* this would simplify our enumerable problems since we could just call an existing
method rather than having to do more calculations within each block
* a few small ruby style things here and there -- e.g. multiline blocks with {} vs.
do/end etc
* boatload of tests; they run quickly; ultimately would have liked to see some means of
customizing the data without changing csv files

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
