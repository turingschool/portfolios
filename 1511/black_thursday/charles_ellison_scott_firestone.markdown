## Notes

* lots o tests
* they run quick
* spec harness runs speedily -- 26 seconds :)
* finished I0 - 4
* little quirk around class-level sales engine handling
* successful at pushing various small bits of logic and relationship querying into
the individual record classes
* this ultimately provides flexible and concise baseline to build on in the analysis
phase, leaving the analysis methods shorter and easier to follow
* good to let the analytics focus on aggregating and manipulating the collections of
data rather than building the collections themselves

* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections
