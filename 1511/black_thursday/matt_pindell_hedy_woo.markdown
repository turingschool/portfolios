## Notes

* generally good use of SRP though could refactor responsibilities in analyst class 
* some commented out code in the repo 
* nested enums, can be later refactored 
* good test coverage w/ passing tests, can improve on test performance and abstract out class variables (might think about using test fixtures) 
* had a good discussion about garbage collection and variable setting 
* good understanding of ruby data structure and how to use them / interact with them 
* code quality and style is quite nice

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
