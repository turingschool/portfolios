## Notes

* Clean, easy to follow code
* Like the approach to turning relationship construction into a more declarative process
in the SalesEngine
* Analysis methods make good use of enumerables; use lots of helper methods to keep the
code short and easy to follow
* Good work on extracting some common Stats processes; next step on this would have required
some higher order function usage with blocks or maybe passing symbols to indicate which methods
should be used within the analysis methods
* enumerables are strong and consistent throughout
* nice use of stubbing in the tests to patch things together

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
