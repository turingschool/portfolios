**Notes:**

* Built writer, reader, and numbers extension
* Writer/Reader works with caps, numbers, etc
* Spent about 20-22 hours
* About 6 tests that are high level but test a lot of functionality
* Prefer passing data in / getting data out rather than instance variables

1. Overall Functionality: 3
2. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
3. TDD: 3
4. Breaking Logic into Components: 2

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
