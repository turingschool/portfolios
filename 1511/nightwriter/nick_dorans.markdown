**Notes:**

* Felt it was tough, unsure how to do it at first,
* Started small -- testing a letter at a time, then converting a string, then struggled a bit with capitals
* Spent about 25-30 hours total
* Writer in place but reading doesn't work
* 10 tests, 9 pass, one failing. Writers all pass


1. Overall Functionality (1 - 4)
2. Fundamental Ruby & Style (1 - 4)
3. TDD (1 - 4)
4. Breaking Logic into Components (1 - 4)

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 1: Application only converts to Braille or from Braille

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
