### Notes: All base functionality except for missing payload in posting payload; implemented client registration from browser interface. Great use of testing at all levels. Make sure that you test attributes and relationships instead of just existance. Good use of POROs to delegate responsibilities.

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 4: Application expertly breaks components out to view partials and makes use of both built-in and custom-written view helpers.

## Team: Julian Feliciano & Scott Firestone & Nate Venn
### Assessed By: Andrew
### Notes:

* Solid testing at unit, controller, and features levels. Small suggestions for model testing and feature testing.
* Solid functionality overall. Everything was there, no extentions.
* Would suggest to pay close attention to variable names. Be more explicit.
* small bits of logic sneaking into the views. No large calculations but something to be conscious of moving forward. Do not do this.

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

While you won't be graded on workflow for Rush Hour, here's an example of how you will be evaluated on workflow later in the module:

#### Workflow (NOT GRADED)

* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

## Team: Hedy Woo & Heidi Hoopes & David Whitaker
### Assessed By: Andrew
### Notes:

* Some mixing up responsibilities within tests. Controller test holds some model tests within.
* Controller tests missing a little functionality. Try to test for each route (happy and sad)
* Good use of test helper methods to construct data.
* Model tests have some erroneous assertions, could be ramped up to be a little more robust.
* Pay attention to names of tests.

## Team: Charles Ellison & Allan Blair & Admir Draganovic
### Assessed By: Andrew
### Notes:

* Pay attention to test names. Be more explicit and define exactly what is being tested.
* Write more feature tests. Currently they are sparse and could benefit from testing more functionality.
* No styling. Not in rubric but really need to focus on design/style and ux going forward.
* Poor workflow. Need to focus on this in next group project.
* Model tests didnt test any validations, but tdd of features/stats looked good.

* Styling is good. Ui works and flows.
* Be careful of little things like variable names being explicit.
* Good scoping in feature tests. Need to focus on dynamic data not static info.
* Some view handling in the parser helper
