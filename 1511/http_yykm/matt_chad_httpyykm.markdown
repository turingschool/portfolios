## Evaluation Rubric: Matt & Chad

### Evaluated by: Tess

### Github: https://github.com/chadellison/server_project

### Notes: Got through iteration 3 with the word search. Nice to see compontents broken out into separate classes. It was strange duplication between the iterations. They created separate files for each one. Told them to not do that in the future. 

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application implements three iteration

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
