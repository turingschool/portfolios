## Notes

* Real solid overall; has lots of interesting ideas and approaches to
managing structure
* appreciate that we tag request components with semantic labels
(i.e. put them in a hash)
* still a handfull of long-ish "flow of execution" methods; but at
least they tend to be in the right places so it stays fairly tidy
* overall easy to follow and process
* maybe look at moving initial processing out of initialize and waiting
until the data is needed to generate it (lazy vs. eager)
* testing is thorough with a good number of tests and scenarios

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application implements four iterations

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
