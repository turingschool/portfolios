### Notes

* Good test coverage over lots of cases
* Especially am happy to see tests focusing on the individual implementation
components of each algorithm (checking the merge portion of merge sort, etc)
* implementations are generally pretty clean and true to the concept of each algorithm
* looked at an interesting case in the insertion sort where we could possibly push
2 use cases into the same code path
* added lots of additional work including the benchmarker and the extra sorts

## Rubric

This rubric works like so: In order to get a given score,
you must satisfy not only its description,
but also the requirements of all the scores beneath it.
ie if you did not satisfy the requirements of 2,
then you are not eligible for a 3, even if you satisfied it.

### Functional Expectations

* 4: All three sort classes work as expected with 2 or more extensions.

### Testing

* 4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases
such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.

### Ruby Style

* 3: Code is a readable and effective implementation of the algorithm. Has fewer than 4 "what on earth is this?" lines of code.

### Organization

* 4: Version control maintains the codebase
