### Notes

* 38 tests all pass
* Tests have a good progression, some exploration of edge cases, and some good testing of internals -- just segment them off into their own section
* Try not to use instance variables unless you absolutely need to
* Look for opportunities to use Enum methods to simplify your looping/stopping
* MergeSort does use pretty good set methods and feels like Ruby, but there are
probably areas to simplify/clarify what's happening

## Rubric

### Functional Expectations

* 3: All three sort classes work as expected

### Testing

* 4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases
such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.

### Ruby Style

* 3: Code is a readable and effective implementation of the algorithm. Has fewer than 4 "what on earth is this?" lines of code.

### Organization

* 4: Version control maintains the codebase
