### Notes

* 41 tests all pass
* Good test structure and progression, some attention to edge cases
* Look for opportunities to "speak Ruby"
* Merging of the MergeSort is a bit wild -- look to rewrite following the recursive pattern of your merge

## Rubric

### Functional Expectations

* 3: All three sort classes work as expected

### Testing

* 4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases
such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.

### Ruby Style

* 3: Code is a readable and effective implementation of the algorithm. Has fewer than 4 "what on earth is this?" lines of code.

### Organization

* 4: Version control maintains the codebase
