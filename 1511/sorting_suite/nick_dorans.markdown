### Notes

* Testing suite is good but mostly covers verification / high level behavior
* Would like to see more target tests focusing on specific portions of the implementations
* Implementations are clean and legible; follow the spec of each approach pretty closely
* Keep thinking about naming -- make sure the method names accurately describe what
is being done

## Rubric

This rubric works like so: In order to get a given score,
you must satisfy not only its description,
but also the requirements of all the scores beneath it.
ie if you did not satisfy the requirements of 2,
then you are not eligible for a 3, even if you satisfied it.

### Functional Expectations

* 3: All three sort classes work as expected

### Testing

* 4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases
such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.

### Ruby Style

* 3: Code is a readable and effective implementation of the algorithm. Has fewer than 4 "what on earth is this?" lines of code.

### Organization

* 4: Version control maintains the codebase
