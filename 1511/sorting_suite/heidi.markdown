### Notes

* Test suite shows a good variety of cases, covering edge cases and escalating the complexity
* Tests are pretty standard across the 3 sorting algos; might have been interesting to look at
pulling out more methods for each algo so those could be tested more specifically
* Algos are cleanly implemented and follow the algorithm description cleanly
* Benchmarking infrastructure is in place and has some basic benchmarks; would be nice
to see more benchmarks across wider set of inputs

## Rubric

This rubric works like so: In order to get a given score,
you must satisfy not only its description,
but also the requirements of all the scores beneath it.
ie if you did not satisfy the requirements of 2,
then you are not eligible for a 3, even if you satisfied it.

### Functional Expectations

* 3: All three sort classes work as expected

### Testing

* 4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases
such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.

### Ruby Style

* 3: Code is a readable and effective implementation of the algorithm. Has fewer than 4 "what on earth is this?" lines of code.

### Organization

* 4: Version control maintains the codebase
