### Notes

* hit some neat extensions by including selection sort and quick sort
* quick sort especially is a challenging algorithm so nice work on that
* testing covers lots of cases; uses an interesting inheritance approach
to aggregate handling lots of the edge cases
* in some places we can find ways to achieve the same implementation in a
way that communicates the intent
* tests are great as far as verifying the sorting capabilities; let's keep
looking at ways to add tests that really target the specific details of
each implementation

## Rubric

This rubric works like so: In order to get a given score,
you must satisfy not only its description,
but also the requirements of all the scores beneath it.
ie if you did not satisfy the requirements of 2,
then you are not eligible for a 3, even if you satisfied it.

### Functional Expectations

* 4: All three sort classes work as expected with 2 or more extensions.

### Testing

* 4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases
such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.

### Ruby Style

* 3: Code is a readable and effective implementation of the algorithm. Has fewer than 4 "what on earth is this?" lines of code.

### Organization

* 4: Version control maintains the codebase
