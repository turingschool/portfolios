### Notes

* 23 tests, all pass, about 7-8 per algorithm
* BubbleSort is good
* InsertionSort is good. Look for opportunities to try "ruby-style" operations
* MergeSort is good but "close to the metal" with code. Look for opportunities to use higher-level constructs and approaches.
* Spend time with the Enum exercises and especially the "pattern" sides

## Rubric

### Functional Expectations

* 3: All three sort classes work as expected

### Testing

* 3: Tests cover functionality and demonstrate some escalation of complexity across the examples.

### Ruby Style

* 3: Code is a readable and effective implementation of the algorithm. Has fewer than 4 "what on earth is this?" lines of code.

### Organization

* 4: Version control maintains the codebase
