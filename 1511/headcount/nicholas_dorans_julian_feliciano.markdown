## Notes
* good use of encapsulation and understand of SRP 
* evidence of refactoring to move code into modules
* reasonably good test coverage, though could refactor setup to increase test performance, though still fast 
* great handle on enumerables (fun use of `each_with_oject`) 
* understanding of ruby standard library and helpers within the SL (particularly math based) 
* well-styled code 
* good conversation about variables/gc & performance on array/hash methods 
* file-structure: could use a directory for test data 

## Evaluation Rubric

* 3: Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 *as well as* one of Iterations 5 or 6

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections
