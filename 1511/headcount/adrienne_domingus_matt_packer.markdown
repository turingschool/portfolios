## Notes

* implements expected iterations
* good job tackling vaguely defined result set / result entry stuff in I6
* tests are numerous and effective, relying on a trimmed data set to support easy
testing and anticipation of results
* would have liked to see some means of overriding the data set from tests without having
to edit the data files
* connections between the analyst and the various repositories are clear and easy to follow; however
it does place the Analyst in a privileged position at the top of the hierarchy
* discovered a somewhat rigid dependency on the file structure with harcoded paths in a few places
* analysis methods are well-written and easy to follow; using appropriate enumerables and data helpers to filter down the
data set as needed

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 *as well as* one of Iterations 5 or 6

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
