**Notes:**
Matt had a good understanding of what was going on, I gave him some advice on the correct places to leave comments in ruby code.

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application encrypts, decrypts, and cracks files as described
(works well - just didn't do an extension)

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
(Matt was able to speak to places that he refactored and explain why and how)

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.
(Had a decent test suit, but did not cover any sad paths)

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
(Did a great job of doing this)
