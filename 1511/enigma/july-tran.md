## Student Name - July

**Instructor:**
Meeka

**Repo URL:**
https://github.com/julyytran/enigma

**Notes:**

July did a great job of demo-ing. July had an extension completed but a strange edge while we were demoing it came up. 
I told her if she could write a test for the edge case and fix it by EOD, I would count it. She did, so 4s all around.


## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application follows the complete spec and one extension


### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring


### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration


### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
(There were not many classes and the files were longer on this project but July was able to justify why she felt this was appropriate and the code itself was structured well and used inheritance)
