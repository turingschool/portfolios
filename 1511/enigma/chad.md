**Notes:**
I think Chad panicked about missing functionality and as a result, entire app was broken and the test suite was failing on master.
He had two massive commits, so we couldn't roll back to the point where he said 'everything worked'

Over all, I thought his app was very close to being complete
- but since I couldn't roll him back because of a bad commit history and because he clearly didn't TDD the new work he did that broke everything, it was a failing project.

***My Recommendation*** is to give Chad a chance to fix his existing project - get the tests working and functionality working and re-evaluate. The code itself was solid, but the workflow was terrible.


## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

(This was done really well, which is why I feel that a chance to fix the project would be warranted)
