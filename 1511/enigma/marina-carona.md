## Student Name

**Instructor:** Andrew

**Repo URL:** https://github.com/marinacor1/Enigma

**Notes:**
Encrypt works and makes a new file, however it changes from a string to an array of strings for the new file. Decrypt doesn't run from the terminal and no crack.
Runner file was a god like object and had too much responsibility. Testing wasn't very TDD but on the way. Saw some highlights in some pieces of code that I thought were really good, but overall the project was unsuccessful. Instructed student to work on TDD and refactoring to smaller pieces over break.




## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality - 1

* 4: Application follows the complete spec and one extension
* 3: Application encrypts, decrypts, and cracks files as described
* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations
* 1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style - 2.5 * Thought there were less than 6 long methods there weren't many methods overall and I think this should be a focus for the student moving on.

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 3. Test-Driven Development - 2

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.
* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components - 2

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together
