## Student Name - Admir Draganovic

**Instructor:**
Meeka

**Repo URL:**

**Notes:**

Admir had not built an Enigma class, therefor he could not display either pry or file reading.

I gave him a chance to show how encrypting and decrypting work in pry or to encrypt or decrypt manually and he was very unclear how things were working.

It's possible that he was just very nervous because he had broken up his logic well in the code.

I would recommend giving him a chance to write the Enigma function in his code and get re-evaluated on overall functionality.


## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage

No actual Enigma class, see notes above for recommendation/details

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
