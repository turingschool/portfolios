## Student Name - Briand Rippetto

**Instructor:**
Meeka

**Repo URL:**


**Notes:**
Brian had a good understanding of the app and was able to display all pry functionality but was not able to do the decypting/encrypting/cracking in a file.
He had a decent amount of repetition in his code, but I felt the repetiion was there to try and make his code readable and understandable. 
He was able to understand my refactoring suggestions, and I suggested he read POODR over the break - as I felt his weaknesses were in code repetition and improved testing fundamentals.

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations
(Pry functionality worked but could not read and write with a file)

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
(I went over some refactors but generally felt that Brian really understood his code and didn't copy pasta it - he was at a solid place for three weeks in)

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.
(Originally hulk raged and gave him a 2 for failing tests - but turned out the tests were failing due to the date having changed from yesterday to today.
Because of that, I gave him a 3. He has some work to do on properly testing)

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
(This was done really well)
