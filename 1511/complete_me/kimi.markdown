**Notes:**

* good # of test
* checking coverage :)
* love seeing the pseudocode / planning doc in the repo
* would like to see a few more "trivial" cases in the tests, mostly
for the sake of making it easier to inspect the entire structure of the trie
down to a couple levels deep
* overall solution is quite concise; like seeing how you stuck
to the essentials of the algorithm
* using different enums to build up collections of nodes and
manipulate them is good
* good job making use of your fundamental methods in various parts
of the code

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
