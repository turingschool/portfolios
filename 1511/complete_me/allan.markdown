**Notes:**

* good job finishing all the base features and adding your own shoes app
* i appreciate your taking a stance on different algorithm approaches --
picking your own ways to figure out how build each piece
* tests show strong progression from trivial cases to the more complex
* using tests to verify the structure of the trie as we build it up
* would think a little more about test naming -- try to name tests in a
way that really describes what you're doing
* along the same lines, think about naming methods from the perspective of
the values that they produce rather than the means by which they produce them
* don't forget to distill boolean if/else's into simple boolean expressions
* some nice use of various enum methods to get jobs done (with index, map, etc)

## Evaluation Rubric

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
