**Notes:**

* pretty clean implementation that came a little short of some
features; actually our counting was only off by 1 small bug
and we got that working pretty easily
* passes all the base spec; didn't get to the supporting feature
* tests are ok but mostly hitting the high level "does it work"
kind of assertions
* would like to see a few more trivial cases that start to verify
the actual structure of the trie
* i like your approach to re-constructing the suggestion words
as you walk down the trie
* one other piece of food for thought is to consider ways to achieve
the same goal without mutating a shared object

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application is missing one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
