**Instructor:** Horace

**Repo URL:** https://github.com/julsfelic/complete_me

**Notes:**

* Solid completion including baseline, 1 supporting feature, and the
shoes extension
* Testing is quite solid; especially like the tests around the insertion
process; good to see the progress of building up the trie over successive
inserts
* Overall code structure is strong and makes good use of recursion to
manage the process of walking down into the trie
* Sometimes our recursive / walking workflows get a little convoluted
as we start pulling in multiple methods that fall back on one another etc.
* I'm still curious about the combination of the recursion and a looping
structure; seems like we could get by with one or the other of these without
needing both

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
