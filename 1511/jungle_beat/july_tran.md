### Evaluation

* Functional Expectations (1 - 4)
* TDD (1 - 4)
* Encapsulation (1 - 4)
* Ruby Style and Fundamentals (1 - 4)
* Looping / Recursion (1 - 4)

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
