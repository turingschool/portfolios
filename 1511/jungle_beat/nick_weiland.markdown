**Notes**

- great testing!!
- great conceptual understanding but some of the code needs to be refactored, broken out into smaller methods and check for duplication

### Evaluation

* Functional Expectations (1 - 4)
* TDD (1 - 4)
* Encapsulation (1 - 4)
* Ruby Style and Fundamentals (1 - 4)
* Looping / Recursion (1 - 4)

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
