**Notes**

- Good, thorough testing. Make assertions about all of the data in the test. Use 'assert' rather than 'refute'.
- Try to avoid nested if/else and while loops
- break out logic (especially duplicate logic) in smaller methods
- Scott has a good idea of what needs to be done but is lacking the tools and/or familiarity with handy ruby methods 

### Evaluation

* Functional Expectations (1 - 4)
* TDD (1 - 4)
* Encapsulation (1 - 4)
* Ruby Style and Fundamentals (1 - 4)
* Enumerables (1 - 4)

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application is missing one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
