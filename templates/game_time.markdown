## Detailed Rubric:

### Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension
* 3: Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
* 2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes
* 1: Application crashes during normal usage

### Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of JavaScript syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* 2: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly-named variables, and needs significant refactoring
* 1: Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

* 4: Zero complaints
* 3: Five or fewer complaints
* 2: Six to ten complaints
* 1: More than ten complaints
