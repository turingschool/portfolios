# \Sam Nayrouz - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> \I wanted to be able to create an application that consumed multiple APIs to centralize information I wanted. I ended up doing that with BEN ticker, which was a lot of fun and frustration. One thing I need to be better at is working in development vs. working in production. I'm more frustrated when I can't deploy to production than I am about anything else.

>* This module has been great. I loved consuming APIs and learning more about REST and GraphQL. I'm excited to get the GraphQL meetup going and meeting companies/people who utilize it.
>* I hate that I was sick for the beginning and end of this mod. I need to take better care of myself.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
>* Build a basic version of the Github profile / feed UI. 
>* Learned how to authenticate a user through an API. Learned more front design techniques to clone the UI of Github. First attempt at consuming an API and it was fun.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)** 
>*  Rails API used to serve up JSON records and e-commerce business intelligence.
>* This project seemed a lot more difficult than it really was. The most challenging aspects were the ActiveRecord queries, and not building out the internal API

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* Brownfield project. An e-commerce website replete with user authentication, authorization, shopping-cart functionality and API consumption.
>* Working with existing code is tough and frustrating. Pre Planning was the biggest takeaway for me as I thought if we had planned better, we would have foreseen issues that arose late in the week. I also liked hand rolling permissions. It gave me a better understanding of the architecture of the application.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
\ I felt as if this module, Gear Ups got REAL. I had a better understanding of everyones backgrounds and why/how they approach social issues based on their backgrounds. More than ever, I understand that we all have our past that has shaped us, and it's important to remember that we're all different, but we're still all humans and we should treat each other in that manner.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWMX50hKHGs&t=1s

#### **Posse**
  >* We did JS and Ruby Codewars to prepare for obscure interview questions and better understand each language.
  >* I love working with the front-end student because I like to see if they solve challenges like we do.
  >* It's opened my eyes on how to approach challenges that I've never experienced before. It's helped foster an approach to looking at a problem and taking the right steps to solve it.

#### **Playing a Part**

> I started the GraphQL Denver/Boulder Meetup which was a big success for the first time. I hope more Turing students/grads come and support me as it grows. I also want to give another lightning talk in mod 4 just to get more comfortable speaking in front of crowds.
