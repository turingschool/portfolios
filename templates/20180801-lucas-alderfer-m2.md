## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

  This module I set out to accomplish both being able to query databases well (I was told to emphasize this skill in both ActiveRecord and SQL by my mentor coming in), and making a web page.  I think I was successful in learning what I set out to do with the possible exception that I am not as great at CSS as I wanted to be.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  I struggled most with ActiveRecord queries, mostly the more complicated ones, and figuring out exactly what I need to do to get them to work and not just give a relation.  I learned a lot about ActiveRecord and I think I actually learned the most through repeated failure.

## Blog

My blog post is about how easy it is to build your own site on Rails, and someone I don't know followed me on Medium so it must be good, right?

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?

I think it really was, and it was very helpful to do it all early, though I doubt any future students would appreciate the thought, I think it could be longer with more of the high level of difficulty ones at the end, understanding how to do that is key to navigating BikeShare.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

  RailsMini and BikeShare were favorites, I enjoyed trying to push myself for everything I could think of implementing in the RailsMini and not feeling like I had to focus extra time on things I knew and could push for things I didn't know that well in my Rails Mini.  BikeShare required things we knew how to do to be done often and at the highest level and still gave that feeling of pushing you to excel.  Least favorite, retrospectively, is LittleShop, I liked it a lot at the time mostly because my group helped me to learn a lot, but afterward it felt like I cemented how to do things the wrong way when all the commands and workflow changed in Rails, made it feel like the primary learning experience was getting comfortable with things changing and learning how to do things a different way, but nothing specific to the hard curriculum of the mod.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

  I learned a lot from my independent project, but the biggest standout was that I am way too ambitious and optimistic about what I can get done in set periods of time.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

  I learned a lot about GitHub workflow when working with 3 partners, and I feel infinitely (yes, actually infinite) more comfortable with branch logic and conflicts and just working in GitHub in general.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

  Unfortunately I do not think I was much of a contribution to Turing this module with possible exceptions of giving some classmates pep talks or rides home, and making coffee most days after the first containers are empty.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

  I would like to continue to at least do the same, but I would also like to be available to help students of lower mods more.
