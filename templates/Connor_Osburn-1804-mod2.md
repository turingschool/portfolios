# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I believe I accomplished the task of asserting and refining my logical and algorithmic skills during mod 1. The most challenging task was going to be picking up tools and memoriizing commands, which was the thing that permeated mod 2. It was very difficult and my primary goal.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled with tools and memorization mostly. I found myself in situations where I didn't know how to move forward, which was different for me. I learned how to google and research better,

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

I learned most of my activerecord from research for the obstacle course.

## Projects

I enjoyed bike share the most due to the complexity and ability to flex my different muscles.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  I learned a lot about rails from the rails mini project. It forced me to implement things like users and admins that I'd never done oujtside of class.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned how to work with people. A group is way different than one or two people. IT is very easy for one person to get left behind. The work flow takes a lot of getting used to.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I participated in a posse and did a lot of helpijg of mod 1 students.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I would like to start a posse centered around my strengths to help extend the learning of other students.
