# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

I want to focus on recognizing the similarities and differences in programming language
syntax and conventions between Ruby, Javascript and appropriate frameworks. I want to focus
on my main objective coming into Turing which was to build an iOS app and use machine learning.
I also hope to be interviewing for jobs during the last few weeks of Turing. I believe
interviewing early will allow me to come back to Turing with questions I have about
the process and how I can get better.

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
Fail (N/A)

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
- Appending data, not getting the same color to appear twice and refactoring the
code without losing functionality.
- Forgot to enable autosave on Atom after switching from Xcode and Rubymine which
completely through off everything I was doing.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
- Debugging in the console and making the requests to the Rails API.
it's always fullfilling when your API is doing what you want it to do.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
- Looking through the mozilla jquery docs and trying to understand
what the outcome I wanted would be and work backwards.

* What did you learn?
It's better to fail honestly than to cheat.

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
N/A

* What was your biggest challenge?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you learn?

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

The biggest challenge I faced was turning my pseudocode into vanilla javascript.
I knew what needed to happen and what functions needed to be called in each class,
but had a hard time translating that into Javascript. I still am fairly new to
debugging in javascript and I wish I can improve on that skill more across all languages
and frameworks.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I made a better plan on how to attack Javascript. I went ahead and pseudocoded the
methods I knew I needed. Once I did that, it made looking through resources more
efficient. I was able to pin point certain functions I was looking for pertaining to
math and manipulating the DOM elements in the browser.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

It challenged me in a way like mod 1 challenged me. I felt like I didn't know what I
was doing and didn't know where to begin. But having formulated a plan of attack
and having a more structured process around solving each card helped me stay organized
and focused on what I needed to complete to complete a card. It made me feel as if
I had started a job and was told to do something I had no idea how to do. I now
feel more comfortable with that challenge come job time because of this project.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

 - Ajax Requests in Javascript and Jquery
 - Learning how to switch over backends on an existing code base
 - Writing DRY and OO code in Javascript

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

- I wish that testing was mandatory for this project or that we would have used TDD
to drive the development of this project. I believe using TDD to drive development
would have helped me understand the outcome we actually wanted and helped take a weight
off my shoulders in terms of process.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

Frustrating at times due to the fact neither of us had answers for each other.
We were both stuck Googling and asking as many people as possible for help. But in
a way it was also refreshing because it gives you that uncomfortable feeling of
"I don't know anything", the same feeling from module 1, and more rewarding when
you do figure out a solution to your problem.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
My biggest technical challenge was learning Swift (at a beginner level) and Xcode
and putting it into a project. I only had about 5-6 weeks learning Swift on my own
and I didn't want that to hinder me a week into the project.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Many hours of practice and throwing things against a wall to see if it stuck. Thankfully,
Apple has the best documentation I've ever seen and Xcode is an amazing IDE. I did many
YouTube tutorials over the two week break and over Christmas break. I had a side goal
of building something for the code fair and then building off of that for my capstone project.
I was able to build a small app with an API call to watson's visual recognition API. Once I was
able to do that, I had a better gameplan for my capstone moving forward.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
My biggest accomplishment was being able to take all the tools Turing has taught me
and tools and process that I've learned myself and apply them to a project. I wanted to challenge
myself in a sense of can I pick up another language quickly and make an application
that was functional to users. I also liked that I was able to push myself on the machine
learning end. I set a goal to implement machine learning into my time at Turing
and I was able to find great resources around implementation in Swift and my capstone
project.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
- Converting a dataset into a caffe model using DIGITS and then converting that caffe model
into a CoreML model to use in Swift.
- User experience and accessibility felt more important in this application because
the user interacts with a camera and Twitter.
- Using AWS Amazon Machine Images Instances to setup an environment to use DIGITS.

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
- During the Technical Communication Assessment, I liked the immediate feedback
throughout the entire process. It felt more conversational and engaging rather than an
assessment of my knowledge. It recently helped in an on-site, white boarding interview.
I was able to be more comfortable in asking questions along the way and being ok
with saying "I don't understand the question" or "so do you mean?...". I think my
biggest challenge when it comes to interviewing is I prepare alone and so often times,
I'm not speaking out loud. I'm going to change this up so that I'm either rubber ducking
interviews or coming in with Ian or skyping with Ian just so that I can get feedback.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

I thoroughly enjoyed the entire process of planning, revising and facilitating
our session on Growth Mindset. I believe one thing that every Turing student has
in common at some point during their time here is going into a fixed mindset after
hours or days of frustration. The biggest challenge I thought we would face going
into the Gear Up was that no one would want to share about their experience when they
thought to themselves they wouldn't be able to achieve a certain goal here at Turing.
What we did was start with examples of fixed mindsets we faced early at Turing and
how we worked through those to get where we are today.

What I really enjoyed and felt most rewarding was how slowly everyone began to engage
about their thought process from having a fixed mindset to moving towards a growth mindset.
After the coding challenge, everyone talked about their thoughts while taking the assessment
and almost everyone had the same, fixed mindset feelings. So we were able to showcase
that we all go through and struggle through the same issues so our best resources are
the people around us when we feel like we can't do something. We're all here to support each
other and not to come out as the "best Turing student" because in actuality, no one cares
that you were the smartest person, they care about the attitude you when solving problems
together.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
I hosted another Meetup at The Denver Post which was a really cool experience. It's
always great to represent the Turing community in the Denver tech community and that
we're more than just students in a bootcamp.

I believe it's required because this is how the software development community works.
Having worked at Stack Overflow, I have a great understanding of the developer community
and the support we have for one another. Software development is more than just writing code,
it's about coming together as a team and growing personally and professionally. In all
my years of sales, I've never experienced a community with that type of support and
level of enthusiam to their craft. It's an exciting time to be a software developer.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

- Working well with others and in a team. I think I've had every experience one could
have when working on a group project here at Turing. The good and the bad have helped me
grow as a partner and team member and I look forward to bringing those soft skills
to my first engineering team.
- Test driven development: I fell in love with TDD in module 2. The first time I felt
like a web developer was building a web application without ever opening the browser.
It was rewarding and one of the most helpful set of tools I'll keep forever as a
software engineer.
- Reading and parsing through documentation. I stumbled through a lot during the
first weeks of Turing because, other than stack overflow, I didn't know where to look
for answers to my questions. Since all documentation is different, I've learned to be
patient when looking for an answer to my question. Odds are I'll never find the exact
answer to my question, unless it's API related, but even then, I still need to be comfortable
knowing where to look. For example, simply going to the Rails docs on GitHub to see what was
going on under the hood was very beneficial to me in understanding the "Rails magic" that
occurs.
