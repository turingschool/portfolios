# Benjamin Jacobs B4 Portfolio

## Area of Emphasis

This module, for me, was all about the next steps. Figuring out ways to continue to push my technical knowledge further on the front end while hammering the job search/professional networking as hard as possible. I definitely felt like I came into Mod4 with a fire to make something professionally happen by the end of the mod. Additionally, I wanted to make sure that my capstone project was something I could be proud of and would be an exciting portfolio piece to show these new professional connections. I believe I have stuck to these goals and am mostly happy with how this module turned out.

## Assessment

I passed both the JavaScript assessment as well as the technical communication assessment. I think the biggest technical challenge for me was remembering to think either in ES6 or ES5. I was tending to reach for whichever pattern I was more comfortable with for a particular problem and needed to make sure I was staying consistent. I thought the word watch challenge was generally fun to work on. It was great to feel an easy facility with JS and to get to think more about design principles. Through both of these assessments I learned that I am capable of assimilating new languages/concepts effectively, implementing them to solve problems and can speak about them with clarity and intelligence.

## Quantified Self

The biggest technical challenge on this project was dealing with switching out the backend halfway through the project. We had already been utilizing serialized data from the rails backend and when we switched over to the Express server the incoming data was no longer formatted the same. In order to deal with this we simply built a serializer that intercepted the data in our controller and formatted it so it was identical to the rails server output and thus what the front end was expecting. I think the three stand out technical concepts from this project were event delegation, immediately invoked function expressions, and a thorough understanding of cross origin resource sharing. If I could change one thing about our approach to this project it would have been to build the front end in a framework like React to have gotten more reps on those concepts.

## Capstone Project

My biggest technical challenge on my capstone project was dealing with vastly different API inputs in addition to the complexity of dealing with three different OAuth/API protocols. My approach to solving this problem was simply to move slowly and look for patterns. I implemented a tactic by which I built the essential elements of the project without tests in order to verify inputs and connection points followed by mocking out all of those connection points. After that I was able to rebuild the same functionality in a test driven way, which allowed me to refactor and find better design patterns. I enjoyed this challenge because it felt like a realistic problem. I imagine that on the job having to deal with various different external implementation protocols is a neccessity and I was happy to have the opportunity to develop a process around it. In terms of technical concepts that I learned I would say the implementation of Vue.js, advanced controller patterns in rails, utilizing Socket.io for websockets and webhook/push-notification/pub/sub/hub patterns for a variety of external services.

## Feedback

I think the single best piece of feedback I got this mod was from Schutte regarding tactics for getting attention from prospective employers/professional networking. He told me that my passion and eloquence is very clear when I am speaking and that I should leverage that. Write short, to the point, emails and get them on the phone. From there my natural presence would do the rest. He was right and it fundamentally changed the way I approached networking and I was more successful as a result.

## Gear Up

I have never been the biggest fan of Gear Ups and, at least at the beginning, this experience was no exception. It started off seeming like a distraction from more important priorities during the mod. However, it ended up being very topical. What my group worked on was â€˜The Not So Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck' which, as we were planning, started to resonate a lot with my current state of mind. More in the sense of deciding on my own priorities and de-cluttering the other aspects of my mental life. I found it a helpful way to reflect. The most rewarding aspect really came, just today, when our group got excellent feedback from the attendees. It seems as though they got a lot out of the session and it makes me happy and proud to have facilitated that.

## Community Involvement

Though it was difficult to split my mental effort this mod, as I was already feeling pulled in multiple directions with the job hunt and project work, I did find time to make an extra effort with my posse. The members that stuck it out and continued attending were mostly lower mods and it put me in the position of being able to answer questions, offer advice and generally be somewhat of a helpful resource. This carried over into seeking out students in the mod1, 2, and 3 backend program during particular projects that I had enjoyed working on. I would check in with them whenever possible, helping out if necessary and desired. I think this is a vital part of Turing. Knowledge and experience are meant to be shared and no one learns well in a vacuum. The community elements are the pillars that keep the basement a positive place and effective educational institution.

## Going Forward

Discipline. Hustle. Skill.
