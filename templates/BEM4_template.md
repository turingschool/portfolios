# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What did you want to focus on this inning? What did you hope to accomplish by graduation?

>I hoped to learn React/React Native. I hoped to jsut graduate, I never thought I would make it. I still don't.


## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
Pass

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

>That I need to slow down. For over 2hrs, I didn't see that my input wasn't sanitized. Because it still contained commas and periods it wasn't doing the thing that I needed.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

>I like that I actually knew what I was doing. My fear of failing and not graduating combined with my general anxiety of imposter syndrome. 

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

>I freaked out for about 2hrs, finally asked Lauren for help, in an aside comment she mentioned something about sanitized input and it clicked. It didn't take me too long after that to finish. I did the majority of the work for this in the last 30-40minutes.  

* What did you learn?

>I learned that if I slow the hell down, I can figure out almost anything.


## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
Pass

* What was your biggest challenge?

>Talking. I tend to freeze up when required to display my knowledge. I tend to get nervous and trip over my own tongue.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

>Lauren. She is very soothing and reassuring.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

>I didn't

* What did you learn?

>Not really sure. That I still ahve problems communicating my knowledge in a test setting.


## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

>doing a project after only having learned the language a day previously.


* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

>Asked frontend students LOTS of questions as well as former students.


* What did you like the most about the challenge?

>Learning a new language.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

>DOM manipulation, appending to HTML elements, promises

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

>Slow down. I tend to try and go fast because I never think I'm going to finish. But when I do that, I miss the little things in a timely fashion. 

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

>It was fine. My partner had personal issues so we worked seperately the whole time.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

>React.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I asked ALOT of questions of the frontend students

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

>Leaning how react works

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

>React, async, data down/actions up

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?

>Spree gem.

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

>Finding an issue that was manageable in the time alotted.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

>Implemented RWD principles. vmax, allow you to define dimensions as a percentage of the width or the length of the viewpor

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

>Was neat to contribute

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

>I'm not sure I learned any new concepts here. Other than protocol for open source contributing.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

>Katelyn bashing my capstone. But then telling it was only because she felt I could handle it and implement the suggestions.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

>I did not like this at all. I'm not very good at writing in general. When I am super not confident about a topic I don't like to talk about it like I do. Everything about it was challenging. I know nothing about writing in general and then I'm expected to tell others how to do a thing. I really enjoy teaching, when I understand the subject. I actually went to school for teaching, taught classes in the Marines and taught Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

>I reached out to all of the lower backend mod students and regularly paired with them.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

>Process, ... I don't know that there's any three specific things. I am going to take the Turing ethos/mission statement with me for sure.

## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [30-day post-grad job search action plan](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/week/2018/1/16):
* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.

>I am not good at this at all. I don't sell myself well at all. This is not a growth mindset thing. This has been me my whole life, just not as outwardly shown. My 'elevator pitch' is 2 sentences long. I'm not sure out to expand that into 1-2 minutes. I was told to use the summary for our resumes for this which was longer, but then wa told by Ian to shorten it down to 2 sentences. But here it is: Former Marine/Baker transitioning into software development. I look forward to joining a diverse team of motivated people to help be a part of this ever changing landscape
* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
