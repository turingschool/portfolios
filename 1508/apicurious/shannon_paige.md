Notes:

* Nice completion -- recreated base twitter experience and added
2 extensions -- retweeting and unfollowing
* Tests are pretty solid mostly around the single Twitter Service object --
lots of coverage on this and using VCR pretty effectively to trap its data
* Using the omniauth data structures to practice making user objects from
the tests is helpful
