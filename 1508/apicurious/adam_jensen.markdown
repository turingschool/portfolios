**Instructor:** Horace

**Notes:**

* pretty strong technically; like the abstractions around
managing the twitter connections - letting each user generate its
own TwitterClient connection and delegating through various method calls
* Testing is especially good on the client itself, and then a little
lighter on the rest of the app, which is probably a smart allocation of
effort
* UI still could a little polish but the main interactions are all there
added the retweet and reply to extensions

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 4: Developer delivered all planned features plus 2 extensions.

**2. Organization**

* 3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%), tests at the feature and unit levels, and does not rely on external * services.

**2. Code Quality**

* 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

### Product Experience

**1. User Experience**

* 2: The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective
