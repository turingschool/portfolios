Notes:

* solid implementation of baseline features - view my tweets; fetch user info;
post a tweet; favorite a tweet
* got some start on the testing; seems like we had a few issues with VCR etc;
overall number of tests is lacking and there are still some problems with managing
the connection to API data
* like the use of twitter api objects to manage connection to the external data
* user creation process could probably be tidied up -- seems like we are doing some
unnecessary saving / updating of db records

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

**2. Organization**

* 3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 2: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>70%), but does not adequately balance feature and unit tests

**2. Code Quality**

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

### Product Experience

**1. User Experience**

* 3: The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality
