**Instructor:** Horace

**Notes:**

* solid implementation of base spec and some extra pagination for flavor
* uses VCR to wrap up test integrations with the twitter data
* uses a service object and our own trimmed-down open-structs to represent
tweet data
* keep an eye on method names -- `check_for_updates` should actually check something
