### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
-[Hint - pre-work list is in the lesson plan](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/edit/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/bartleby_project.markdown)
* I did not know how real-time apps worked or even what their structure was before
watching the pre-work videos. I found the high-level explanation of Ember and
electron very helpful before tackling the project, without that previous explanation
I think a lot more time would have been spent in the docs.

### How far were you able to get on features in your application
* create note
* save note to file system
* edit note content and save to filesystem
* render html/markdown
* note filtering
* started to implement a menubar companion app

## Risk Taking
  #### What risks did you feel you took on this project?
  * Slight risk was choosing which front-end framework to use....if it ended
  up looking like crap then I wouldn't want to every use it. Went with Photon
  for a native looking app.

  #### How do you feel about those risks?
  * Feel good about it.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
