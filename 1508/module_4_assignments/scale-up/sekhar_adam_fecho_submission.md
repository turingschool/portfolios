### Link to any pull requests you submitted outside of your project
- https://github.com/stevekinney/file-bin/pull/16 

## Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
- The pre-work was good. Our favorite part of the pre-work was Steve's discussion of what makes client-side programming diffult. We likek the Intro to Sockets explanation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfGORL8ebn8).

### How far were you able to get on features in your application
- We got through all five of the base features, and we got one (delete) of the extension features

### Link to blog post(s) submitted

### Sekhar's Blog Post
  - Title: Building a Notes App in Ember and Electron
  - Summary: Ember and Electron are cool, give us a lot more capabilities in building an app, but were also difficult at first with a somewhat steep learning curve. Our main challenge was dealing with all the new syntax and confusing file structure. Overall we were able to complete an MVP-type app that does store and save notes created by a user. Go Ember and Electron!

### Adam's Blog Post
  - Title: Building an app with Ember and Electron
  - Summary: A high level description of Ember and Electron as technologies and what they provide. Insight into working with Ember, Electron and Sekhar to build my first desktop application. Detailed discussion of problems and successes.

## Risk Taking
  - What risks did you feel you took on this project?
    - We attempted a menu item icon, up in Mac at the top of the laptop screen. Did not pan out fully.
    - Also used the Photon framework for styling, which was effective, but we haven't pursued as much as we could. We think this could make the project really pop later, so will hopefully work on it further soon.
  - How do you feel about those risks?
    - Feeling pretty good. One risk (the menu item) didn't pan out, and the other worked out mostly well. With Photon the app looks almost like a native Mac app!

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
  - Can Meeka sing at our grad dinner?
  - When will our Ember skills match Steve Kinney's, if ever?
