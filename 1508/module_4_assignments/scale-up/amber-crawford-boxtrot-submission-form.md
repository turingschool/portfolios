### Something from the pre-work that I didn't know about before this week...
One thing from the prep-work that I especially liked was the template for great model testing in Rails.  I do think that I've tested my models pretty well in the past but this gist showed some areas that I have definitely missed and gives a great example of thorough testing that I'm going to use in future applications!

### Summarize what you worked on
For this project I primarily worked on a research spike into Docker technology and whether or not it would be a good fit for our project.  I spoke with Turing mentors and completed practical tutorials to interact with the framework and gain a better understanding of its value adds and use workflow.  Ultimately, we decided not to integrate Docker at this time but will document the investigation for potential future use. While working through Docker tutorials, I also integrated Puma into our application as a concurrent web server.

### My experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
I found this to be one of the most valuable parts of this project!  Since I was not touching too much of the code in our project, I did not get a chance to submit many pull requests and receive code review though I did attempt to keep the team up to date through comments on my issues.  Commenting on the the team's pull requests though let me feel like I still had a really good idea of what our project looked like and the work that they were doing, which was really valuable.

### My experience doing daily stand ups
Love them!  We used to do these on our team at my last company and it is such a great way to keep th team on the same page throughout the week, especially when they are working on such different issues.

### Features I would like to see LookingFor have in the future
I think it would be great to evenutally create user accounts, allowing both students and staff to star jobs or companies that they are interested in, track applications they have submitted or connections that they have made and share them with the Turing community to try and find useable connections.
