### Link to any pull requests you submitted outside of your project
- [destroy()](https://github.com/stevekinney/file-bin/pull/9) method
- We implemented  destroy functionality for the file-bin module. It takes a single argument of the fileName that you want to delete. It will delete the specified file and return the name via a promise.

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
- That WE could build a desktop application by leveraging our current skillset.

### How far were you able to get on features in your application

### Link to blog post(s) submitted

### Aaron:
  - Title: [Optical Character Recognition (“OCR”) in a Ember & Electron App](http://www.aaroncareaga.com/optical-character-recognition-in-a-ember-electron-app/)
  - Summary: A store of real-life stuggle building a NPM OCR library for our Ember Electron application.

### Jhun:
  - Title: [That One Time I built a Desktop Application...](https://medium.com/@joshuajhun/that-one-time-i-built-a-desktop-application-1683e6901e86#.o66thpp43)
  - Summary: A blog post that talks about building a desktop application with Ember and Electron.

## Risk Taking
  - What risks did you feel you took on this project?
  -- We took a lot of risks in this project, from using Ember and Electron to build the recipe application to learning about OCR and building an NPM module.
  - How do you feel about those risks?
  -- We are jacked about those risks. Although Itamae is still a work in progress, we feel the time spent on the NPM module is well worth the effort. It allowed us to explore a technology we've been interested, contribute to the open source community, and improve the origin application by incorporating a more robust set of features for the user.
