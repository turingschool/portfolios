N\A #YOLO

Here's my gem though - [we_work_remotely_jobs](https://rubygems.org/gems/we_work_remotely_jobs)

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

It was great to get experience working in a team on a project that would live on longer than a few weeks.  I really liked having my code reviewed - it made the team aspect feel more significant.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

The stand ups made me feel out of shape, because I started to get tired by the end of them. I liked that they held me accountable for doing *something* each day. I thought they also helped keep us connected, which I appreciated.

### What features would you like to see LookingFor have in the future?

Email summaries! Thrust jobs upon unsuspecting students!
