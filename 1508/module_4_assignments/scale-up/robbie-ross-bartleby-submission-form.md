### Link to any pull requests you submitted outside of your project
- [Pull Request](https://github.com/stevekinney/file-bin/pull/8)
- This pull request was a joint effort between Robbie and I to implement a rename method for File-bin

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
- I didn't know that OAuth was possible from within an Electron app. Robbie and I spent hours trying to get it to work yesterday, but unfortunately it is not fully functional at the time of the assessment. We are going to try to finish it on our own time in the next few weeks.

### How far were you able to get on features in your application
- We have basic CRUD functionality, plus an extension where you can publish the note as an anonymous gist. Eventually we'd like the gist to be associated with an account, hence the OAuth.

## Risk Taking
  - We feel as though trying to implement Github OAuth was quite a risk, as well as implementing a feature for users to publish a gist.
  - We wasted a lot of time trying to get OAuth to work, so we eventually gave up and implemented the gist feature without authentication. We feel like this is a good trade off, and hope to implement OAuth soon/
