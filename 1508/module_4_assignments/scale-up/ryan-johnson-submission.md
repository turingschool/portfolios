### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
The tips and the infromation on how to use Factory Girl was very informative.
Before this project, I had never used it (but I wish I did!) because it makes
associations much simpler.

### Summarize what you worked on
- I built the initial API endpoint that returns all jobs in a paginated format.

### Link to blog post(s) submitted
- [Blog Post](https://medium.com/@rjohnson4444/building-a-paginated-api-7b4f22629b0b#.ebf0go4gd)

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
- Going through the PR review experience was very enlightening. I realized that I was
  nowhere near as thorough as I needed to be. After seeing Meeka review the pull request I
  "thought" I reviewed, I could see I definitely needed to do more "digging". I feel that was very beneficial.

- The PR feedback I got was helpful as well because it reminded me that I need to be
  more aware of the dependencies I introduce into a group project.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
- At first, I thought it was going to be unnecessary, but I realize that it was a very
  practical way to get everyone up to speed on what is happening in the project. I also
  liked that it "felt" like a real, on-the-job project.

### What features would you like to see LookingFor have in the future?
- To build out the API even more with access to a company endpoint, and raw tech endpoint.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
- I really liked this project becasue it was a change of pace and it exposed me to situations
  that do not come up readily in smaller groups. It was also good to really focus on PR and PR
  reviews.
