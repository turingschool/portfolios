- description of work
  Jess and I paired on working through time issues to pull out birthdate, last modified, and last created for the file bin contribution.  We completed this through test driven development with one test per attribute.  Dealing with time always gets super squirelly, but we managed to figure it out in the end. 

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
-[Hint - pre-work list is in the lesson plan](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/edit/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/bartleby_project.markdown)
  I mean if we are talking about what I didn't know the opportunities are endless.... like the fact that Electron creates desktop applications. # oh However, I really enjoyed watching Steve build out the full Ember app because I typically struggle with work flow in a project which makes mine a bit choppy.  I also was really impressed with how much free functionality comes with Ember! it is a lazy developer's dream (not that I am a lazy developer, ahem)!

### How far were you able to get on features in your application
I finished all CRUD functionality as well as searching, parsing, and dividing functionality into components.  At the last minute I decided to pair on tray fun with Jason as well.

### Link to blog post(s) submitted

### Part 1:
  - Title: Trials and Tribulations on an Ember/Electron Application
  - Summary: This blog post sums up my experience with this project thus far including the good, the bad, and the just ok.  I generally talked about my very basic understanding of how the two frameworks interacted with each other and the problems I had with set up which was a large part.  I also praised Ember for their use of components and talked about how that taught me a bit about refactoring.

### Part 2:
  - Title: Go Green and Recycle Code in Ember!
  - Summary: This blog post essentially sounds like Ember hired me to talk them up and I am fine with it.  I was so excited on day 2 when we finally figured out how to use components and this is probably the most refactored project I have ever had (yes, I know it is small).  I went through and explained what components are exactly and then I made a step by step guide on how to implement them in ember projects.

### Part 3:
  - Title: Getting Saucy with Trays in Ember
  - Summary: I did a high level approach to adding a tray icon in an Electron application.  While I am still looking to figure out adding the exact functionality for the drop down menu, this explanation at least gets a picture on the screen!

## Risk Taking
  - What risks did you feel you took on this project?
  Jason and I pulled a Hail Mary and decided to look into tray functionality the morning of this evaluation.  Honestly, Steve will probably hate this but trying to combine this into an Ember/Electron/JS/Bootstrap project made a bit of a Frankenstein at the beginning.  I spent the first four hours of this trying to get my computer to stop bugging out on set up and environment problems.  I also thought that the file bin challenge we chose was also on the more difficult side.  I assumed that time properties came with instatiating new notes like it does in rails, but boy was I wrong.

  - How do you feel about those risks?
  I LOVE EMBER.  I am probably going to continue building on top of this project because for some ungodly reason, Ember actually makes sense to me.  At the end of the day, I am now freakishly good at figuring out npm set up and environment problems.  I went pretty far into a rabbit hole with it, but I am happy to have the experience.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
  I am so happy we got to do an Ember project because I just found my DREAM job in Portland and Ember was the last remaining bullet point I needed to hit on their 'required list.'  I also had a ton of fun delving into Ember docs and articles and enjoyed writing blog posts on them.  I have trouble finding topics that I get super giddy about, but Ember has become one of them!

Instructor Evaluation:

Points: (max 150)

### Rubric

### Blog Post (60 Points - 15 points per section)  

### Participation (30 points)
  * 30: Developer participated daily in courses and stand ups with the group. Developer worked on multiple features or one feature that instructor feels is exceptionally difficult.
  * 20: Developer was absent for 1 lesson, did not participate actively in lessons and peer reviews. Developer worked on one or two 'easier' features.
  * 0: Developer was absent for > 1 lesson, did not participate actively in lessons and peer reviews. Did not deliver or almost deliver any features.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (60 points)

Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

  * 60: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
  * 50: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
  * 30: Developers attempted to implement extensions using technologies not covered in class but it did not result in a delivered feature.
  * 10: Developers but did not build any features.

#### Extension (20 points)

  * Developer contributes to or creates an NPM module/library.
  Not yet other than RECFANGLE, but I will!
