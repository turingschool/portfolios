## Evaluation Criteria

108 points

Good use of abstraction and refactoring. Votes are not displayed on admin view. There are no tests. Good use of objects to isolate logic. Use of handlebars in templates was good. Separation between sockets for admin and user was really good.

### Concept and Features

Does it have the expected features?

* 50 points - Some features were sacrificed to meet the deadline. At best, this is a prototype. Major features covered by the learning goals listed above were not written by the developer.

### Code Quality (JavaScript and/or Ruby)

* 30 points - Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.

### Client-Side Application

* 20 points - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or major bugs.

### Test-Driven Development

* 0 points - No tests were written or the testing framework does not work.

### Interface

* 5 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use

### Workflow

* 3 points - The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
