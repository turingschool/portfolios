## Completion

### Were you able to complete what you feel is the base functionality?
#### If not, list what functionality you think may be missing missing.

Everything works except that I was not able to close the poll.

### What features did you complete which you feel 'exceeded expectations'?


# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[test](https://github.com/jillmd501/new-steve-time/blob/master/test/count-test.js#L4-L15)
#### Why were you proud of this piece of code?
Since API-Curious, I have realllllly struggled with using Test Driven Development. I have had the mind set of just getting it to work, and then worrying about getting enough tests that looked like I deserved at least a three. I used this test to build out so much functionality and while it is only one, it covers a lot of ground.  Honestly, I am mostly happy that I learned how all the pieces of this crazy express app work together. ðŸ’ª

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[client.js](https://github.com/jillmd501/new-steve-time/blob/master/public/client.js#L11-L19)


#### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
It just looks super hacky to me and I know there are ways I could have made this whole process more seamless.  I need to be much more explicit in naming conventions because that in itself caused me so many problems that slowed me down.  EXPLICIT IS KEY.
### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'

it('will not tally multiple votes', function(){
  var expectedResult = {'jill': 2, 'joe': 1}
  expect(countVotes(poll)).to.deep.equal(expectedResult)
});

## Evaluation Criteria

127 Points

Some bugs on main functionality but nothing major. Close poll feature was not implemented. Some tests for the back end. More abstraction of code needed. Good use of EJS templates on the client-side. Commits needed to be broken in smaller steps.

### Concept and Features

Does it have the expected features?

* 50 points - Some features were sacrificed to meet the deadline. At best, this is a prototype. Major features covered by the learning goals listed above were not written by the developer.

### Code Quality (JavaScript and/or Ruby)

* 20 points - Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components. Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many large methods or functions and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code does.

### Client-Side Application

* 25 points - Your application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs.

### Test-Driven Development

* 25 points - The code demonstrates high test coverage. It is tests at controller and unit levels. All controller/routes are tested. There are no failing tests.

### Interface

* 4 points - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Workflow

* 3 points - The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
