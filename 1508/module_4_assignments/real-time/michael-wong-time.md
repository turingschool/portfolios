# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of

[Proud Code](https://github.com/Kealii/real_time/blob/26df3224b4241d2e0d01e5b7d8f9e1309861a969/public/client.js#L30)

#### Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I'm proud of this piece of code because in its initial state, it was even messier. Spending some time building out
helper functions helps significantly with readability and it made it was easier for me to reason about what 
was going on when trying to work on other things.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

[Not Proud Code](https://github.com/Kealii/real_time/blob/26df3224b4241d2e0d01e5b7d8f9e1309861a969/server.js#L40)

#### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I don't feel awesome about this code for the same reason I felt good about the previous piece. This code works, but it
does take a few seconds to translate what's going on and so making any changes was slow going.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
