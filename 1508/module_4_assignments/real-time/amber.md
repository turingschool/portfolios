### Concept and Features

Does it have the expected features?

Nice work here! I didn't see any additional features beyond the main requirements - but this is a solid first version, for sure!

* 75 points - Met expectations as outlined by the user personas, the application is a solid first version. All planned features were delivered.


### Code Quality (JavaScript and/or Ruby)

Some things I might want to see here would be the existance of a `poll` object.

* 25 points - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Client-Side Application

* 25 points - Your application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs.

### Test-Driven Development

I'd really like to see unit levels tests here - you have files that would be easy to test in your `lib` directory - and beyond that, if you refactored out things into `poll` onjects and `pollStorage` - you could test some additional logic buried in the server - such as how a poll is created, how a specific poll is found, etc.

* 20 points - The code demonstrates high test coverage. One or more enpoints are not tested or the internal business logic is not fully tested.


### Interface

* 5 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use

### Workflow

1 point removed for having `node_modules` committed

* 4 points - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
