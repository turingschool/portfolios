Concept and Features

Does it have the expected features?

50 points - Some features were sacrificed to meet the deadline. At best, this is a prototype. Major features covered by the learning goals listed above were not written by the developer.

30 points - Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.

Client-Side Application

30 points - Your application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or now duplication and all components separated out into logical components.

Test-Driven Development

10 points - Many areas of the code are not covered by tests.

Interface

5 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use

Workflow

5 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
