## Completion

### Were you able to complete what you feel is the base functionality?

I think that I was able to complete most of the base functionality.

#### If not, list what functionality you think may be missing missing.

The only thing I have missing is the ability for users to create a poll where everyone can
see the results

### What features did you complete which you feel 'exceeded expectations'?

Using firebase, I was able to store all the data externally, thus a user can go back to look
at all of their polls.

### Attach a .gif, or images of any extensions work being used on the site.

# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of

[yay](https://github.com/rossedfort/crowdsource/blob/master/lib/poll-builder.js#L1-L21)

#### Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I was proud of this code because I thought I did a good job extracting this logic out
not only into separate functions, but also separate files.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

[meh](https://github.com/rossedfort/crowdsource/blob/master/server.js#L64-L97)

#### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I think that having the If/Else statements in the server seems kind of skethy, but due to
sending firebase updates from the server, I needed that functionality. I found it hard to
find refactoring opportunities in these blocks of code.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
