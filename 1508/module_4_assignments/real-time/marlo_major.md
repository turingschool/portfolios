## Completion

### Were you able to complete what you feel is the base functionality?
I was not able to complete setting a time limit on the application.

#### If not, list what functionality you think may be missing missing.
I was not able to complete Timeout and anonymous function does not work correctly.

### What features did you complete which you feel 'exceeded expectations'?
The fact that the application is mostly complete makes me feel pretty excited.
Though I had to get tons of help, I feel as though I learned a lot on this app.

### Attach a .gif, or images of any extensions work being used on the site.
None.

# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
Good Code: [Polls](https://github.com/marlomajor/realtime/blob/master/lib/polls.js)

#### Why were you proud of this piece of code?

This was a part of the code that was created in the beginning during a time when I didn't
have a clue how to build the application. After using Pizza Express and Ask the Audience
to start the project, erasing and beginning again and getting off to the right start was
really nice.

#### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I don't feel awesome about not having any tests. I just didn't have the time.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

No tests.

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'

N/A

After finding out that I would not pass module 4, I initially lost all forward motivation. However,
this past weekend, I figured why not try my hardest on the last project so that if/when I do it again,
I am much better prepared to turn in a finished and complete project. Turns out that websockets isn't so
bad and that crossing the finish line successfully is something I should always strive for. However, something I am not proud of is my git workflow once I start a project. I get off on a good workflow, then while trying to
figure out the logic, I always stop committing and pushing until the very end. I normally always get points taken
away for this and so moving forward, I would like to make many more smaller and dedicated commits.
