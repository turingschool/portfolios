[Awesome code](https://github.com/emilydowdle/real-time/blob/master/server.js#L71-L83)

* This project wasn't easy for me. I had trouble conceptualizing how information gets passed back and forth between the sockets and how to set up routes in Node.
* Once I got the hang of it, I was able to create live chatting as an extra feature. I'm pleased with the refactoring of the code, it's functionality and my growth.
