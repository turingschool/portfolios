### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of

- [Bar Chart](https://github.com/robbielane/poll-time/blob/master/public/components/PollResults.jsx#L4-L24)

#### Why were you proud of this piece of code?
- Not particularly proud of the code itself, but thought it was a cool way to make a quick and easy bar chart. Plus, react makes implementation and animation a snap.

Test-Driven Development

10 points - Many areas of the code are not covered by tests.
Interface

5 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use

Workflow
