## Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[https://github.com/patwey/slime-volleyball/blob/master/lib/scripts/ball.js](https://github.com/patwey/slime-volleyball/blob/master/lib/scripts/ball.js)
- We're proud of this code because it breaks out a lot of logic (lots of small functions) and it makes complicated logic more readable as a result.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[https://github.com/patwey/slime-volleyball/blob/master/lib/scripts/game.js](https://github.com/patwey/slime-volleyball/blob/master/lib/scripts/game.js)
- We feel not awesome about this code because logic is not as broken out as we'd like, making it a bit confusing to follow the flow of the game. Challenges we faced trying to refactor it was the importance of order to the game.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦
15 points - Zero complaints
