## Instructor Section

### Points for first check in (base 50)

50 points

### Instructor's goals for next check in

Next check-in: Thursday

Goals:

* Slime can bounce ball off head
* Ball bounces off head, bounces off walls and stays on the ground if it hits the ground
* Two slimes, both can move left and right with different sets of keys

deliverable: user can bounce ball off slime's head and can travel across the board.

### Feedback?

The pair has already adapted a good pattern and break functionality out in small methods.
