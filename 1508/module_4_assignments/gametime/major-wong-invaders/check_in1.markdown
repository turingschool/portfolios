### What have you accomplished so far?

So far we have the ability to create enemies that can move across the screen
 in one direction. The next goal in the pipeline is to create a Hero ship that
 can respond to keyboard input.

### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

## Instructor Section

### Points for first check in (base 50)
50 points

### Instructor's goals for next check in
- Hero Unit  can move left and right with keyboard input
- Enemy Unit can move left and right on itâ€™s own, enemy does not go off the screen
- Hero Unit can shoot a bullet, renders on canvas, accepts keyboard input
- Stretch Goal - Enemy Unit should zig zag across screen, stopping at edges of canvas

50 points for first three points. 60 points if stretch goal and unit testing for all above.

### Feedback?
Check In pushed for one day so the requirements are a little on the lighter side. I wouldn't be surprised if you guys come in with more accomplished.
