## Risk Taking

- At one point, we attempted to scrap everything and start over to be more clear/concise.
- It didn't pan out, but it helped us understand more about the deficiency in our current code and were able to get 
unstuck.

## Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Proud](https://github.com/marlomajor/gametime_js/blob/880baab9a390862a3764845a91fb5eda4572f881/lib/game.js#L74)

We are proud of this code because we spent hours trying to handle state and in
the end, this was our workaround. It's not the greatest in the world, but it 
gets us closer to an MVP. We are actually very proud of this code and what it
represents (problem solving XD)

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Not Proud](https://github.com/marlomajor/gametime_js/blob/880baab9a390862a3764845a91fb5eda4572f881/lib/game.js#L74)

This code sample is the same as the one above that we are proud of. The reason 
we are both pleased and displeased with this sample is because while it was a 
successful solution, the level of hackiness involved is just too much for the 
level of code we've created up to this point. We are better developers than 
this code gives us credit for.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

Javascript is hard (T_T). Considering building a new game this weekend though! I LOVE PLAYING GAMES I CREATED.

Eval: 90

Total: 230

Functional Expectations

25 points - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

User Interface

10 points - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

Testing

10 points - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

JavaScript Style

20 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow

25 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation
The output from JSHint showsâ€¦
10 points - Five or fewer complaints
