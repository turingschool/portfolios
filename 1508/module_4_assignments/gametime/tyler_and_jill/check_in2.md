In general, I think we are a bit confused about where certain methods should go within the file,
but we were able to clear most of that up by pairing with Meeka and Lovisa.

## Next Steps?
​
### What do you feel the next steps should be?
We think that the next steps should be to end the game when the snake moves outside of the
borders. After that, maybe we can make the snake bigger by appending the food.

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?
​Collisions and grids.
