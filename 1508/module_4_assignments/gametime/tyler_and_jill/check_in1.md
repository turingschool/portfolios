## The Plan

Different images for different pellets
Game is over is snake hits the wall
Add mp3 to play while game is going
Crazy mode- speed and color of snake changes


### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?
If the snake hits itself, the game ends

### What have you accomplished so far?
One pixel moves to the right on the screen and then goes away.
2 passing tests

### Points for first check in (base 50)
50

### Instructor's goals for next check in

* Hook up the arrow keys to the movement
  deliverable: user can move the snake around the screen using the arrow keys
* Place pellets on canvas - One pellet at a time.
  deliverable: there are pellets on the screen
* Snake eats pellets - (Basic collision detection)
  deliverable: pellet is removed when Snake hits it and there is a new pellet on the canvas - pellet is not on snake, off canvas, or on the boarder
