​
#### Questions, Comments, Concerns?
Snake is only growing by small amount for now.
​
## Next Steps?
​
### What do you feel the next steps should be?
Making the snake move like a snake, and grow by proportional body sizes.
Adding Score Board.
​

### Steve's Thoughts
By next check in, for all intents and purposes, build a full, legit snake game, so that after that we can add the things that make it no boring.

We need add mechanics to have the snake properly grow, pause the game and have scores show, etc.
