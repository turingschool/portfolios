#### Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
No.

#### Questions, Comments, Concerns?
We will get to the point where there's a full scoreboard by the assessment. Should we use Firebase, which Robbie showed us, that might help with the scoreboard?

### GOAL 3 - Game ends upon right events (except snake hitting itself)

#### Provide a screenshot or gif or link to code for this goal

#### Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
We still haven't gotten the snake hitting itself functionality done without major bugs. Working on that today as well.

#### Questions, Comments, Concerns?
Just the bug issue that we'd like to sort out.

### GOAL 4 - Game has first level of basic front end

#### Provide a screenshot or gif or link to code for this goal

#### Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
We now have a title, an area where the game is played, and scores rendering on the page.

#### Questions, Comments, Concerns?
We would LOVE help implementing the Gameboy Advance shell we have surrounding the gameplay canvas area. Amber already has processed an image that we would use.
