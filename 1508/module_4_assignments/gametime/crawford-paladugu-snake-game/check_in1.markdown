  * Create interesting front-end
  * Create scoreboard for game
  * Create crazy-mode / difficulty levels
  * Create AI to compete for food pellets/ add difficulty

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

  * Create interesting front-end
  * Create scoreboard for game


### What have you accomplished so far?

- We have created a "Snake" object that has a default position on the screen and can move in all directions with testing for these methods.
- We are able to render a simple canvas on screen with start button that draws a block.
