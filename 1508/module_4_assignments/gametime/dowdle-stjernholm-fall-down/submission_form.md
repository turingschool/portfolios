### What Features, if Any, Do You Feel Exceed Instructor Expectations?
Per Feature:
 - Graphics
 - Ability to pause

## Risk Taking
- What risks did you feel you took on this project?  
We took on a project that (to our knowledge) nobody at Turing has done before.
- How do you feel about those risks?  
It's a little discouraging to feel like risk taking, while beneficial to our learning experience, degrades our overall
scores. We feel we could have earned more points by choosing a more well-documented game like Snake. We'd appreciate some clarification
on how to move forward and select projects for the remainder of the module. It's difficult to balance learning and taking on new
challenges with earning enough points to pass the module.

## Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
- Why were you proud of this piece of code?  
[Ball Helper](https://github.com/matt-stj/fall-down-js/blob/master/lib/helpers/ball-helpers.js)
We are proud of the way we implemented Helpers to pull out functionality and make our code more human-readable.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
- Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?  
[Index.js](https://github.com/matt-stj/fall-down-js/blob/master/lib/index.js)
We feel this code is too verbose, confusing to read and doesn't make adequate use of functions and/or helpers.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

### Test Breakdown
- How Many Unit Tests?  
65

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a unit test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'
[Ball defaults override a ball created with a 0 or negative radius.](https://github.com/matt-stj/fall-down-js/blob/master/test/ball-test.js#L65-L138)

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
In our third checkin, we came with questions about a complete but buggy feature, thinking that the check-in would
be the ideal time to ask questions and seek help. Instead, we were docked 20% of the available points. Had we known we would
lose points, we would have avoiding merging that feature in before the check-in.

Ultimately, this makes us feel like we need to "game" the system in order to optimize our scores rather than focusing
on learning.

## Instructor Feedback

- Points: (base 300)
Checkins: 140
Eval: 135

Total: 275

Functional Expectations

35 points - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expecations set by instructors

User Interface

15 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

Testing

25 points - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

JavaScript Style

20 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow

25 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation
The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

15 points - Zero complaints
