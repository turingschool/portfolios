#### Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.  
No, however it's not working completely as anticipated.  Either scores too many times per gate or doesn't count when the ball passes through a gate. Seems like an issue with iterating through all of the gates during collision detection - and if the ball moves through the gate while the loop isn't on the current gate, then it doesn't count.

#### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

### Goal 3: Game Ends when the ball hits the ceiling
* User sees some indication of ending, including final score
* User should be able to restart the game.
