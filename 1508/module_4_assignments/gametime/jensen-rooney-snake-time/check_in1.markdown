## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Snake moves around screen
- Snake can eat pellets
- When a pellet is eaten, the snake grows in length
- If the snake hits itself or the boundaries of the canvas, the game ends
- Snake is rainbow colored, changes color throughout game
- Crazy Mode makes the snake really fast
- Pellets are instructor's faces and they make a sound when they get eaten
- Cat mode turns the snake into Nyan Cat

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

- Snake moves around screen
- Snake can eat pellets
- When a pellet is eaten, the snake grows in length
- If the snake hits itself, the game ends

### What have you accomplished so far?

- DTRed
- comfortable with expectations
- committed to TDDing the business logic first and getting to the canvas only
- set up waffle

### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

- Should each node execute a set of direction (EX: [x, y direction]) and execute a queue of diretions?! or is that jibber jabber?!
- How can we be aware of the snake's position at all times? ideas: array of arrays?

## Instructor Section

### Points for first check in (base 50)
50

### Instructor's goals for next check in
* (Unpolished) Front End and Backend for snake being moved around screen (not including collision detection) - includes listening to key inputs to move snake
* Randomly appearing pellets that do not land on the snake, off the board, or directly on the board border.
* Snake to eat a pellet, pellet disappears, new pellet appears

50 points for the above, unit tested.

60 points for snake growing in length after eating pellet.

### Feedback?
Discussed VIM mode as a good and reasonable extension.
