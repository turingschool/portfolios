## Completion

### Do You Consider the Application to be Fully Playable?
 - Yes! except for clearing a row. currently it's just a game that fits game pieces together..

### What Extensions, as Requested By an Instructor, Did You Complete?
Per Extension:
- Speed/Difficulty
- https://github.com/acareaga/tetris/blob/master/lib/index.js#L29-L102

### What Features, if Any, Do You Feel Exceed Instructor Expectations?
Per Feature:
 - Describe the feature
 - Provide a .gif of the feature in action or a link to the relevant code

## Risk Taking
- What risks did you feel you took on this project?
- The game was really difficult. We felt that we wanted to push ourselves so that we could understand JavaScript and it's object orient model more clearly. We also wanted to stretch our testing abilities and we felt that this game would allow us to do that. It did, but the logic behind the game was really difficult. With 3 models, 7 pieces, 4 rotations, and having all of these things interact with each other was really difficult.

- How do you feel about those risks?
- We don't regret them. With as much as we know about JavaScript the only thing missing in our application is the ability to clear a row. If given another day we would of totally gotten it. We've learned so much about this language and I feel that this risk will pay off in the future. We are proud of our understanding of higher-level functions (partials), object oriented design in j.s., and ability to iterate through objects.

## Instructor Feedback

- Points: (base 300)
Checkins: 150
Eval: 118

Total: 268

Functional Expectations

20 points - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

User Interface

15 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

Testing

25 points - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

JavaScript Style

20 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow

25 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation
The output from JSHint showsâ€¦
13 points
