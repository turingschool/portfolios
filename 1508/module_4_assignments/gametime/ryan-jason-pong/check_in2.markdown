45 points

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

  * Extract as many static numbers in calculations and replace with numbers based off of object height and width.
* Implement score tracking
  * Display score on screen
  * Display final score
* Implement losing game mechanics
  * Display final score on screen
  * Allow player to restart game
  * Finalize collision detection
* Implement key detection and second player / paddle
  * Should be able to have an ugly UI to test this out

* If all above is accomplished and 70% testing - if UI is pretty (objectively) then 60 points for checkin.
