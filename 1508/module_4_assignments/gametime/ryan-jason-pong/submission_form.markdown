## Completion

### Do You Consider the Application to be Fully Playable?
 * Yes, for functionality of target game - Pong

### What Extensions, as Requested By an Instructor, Did You Complete?
Per Extension:
- Describe the extension
- Provide a .gif of the extension or a link to the relevant code

###### Horizontal movement of paddles
* Besides the required up/down movement of player paddles, also added the
ability to move paddle laterally a restricted amount.

###### 2 Player Independent controls
* Separate controls for each player, can move at same time, in both horizontal
and vertical motions.

### What Features, if Any, Do You Feel Exceed Instructor Expectations?
* Don't honestly feel we exceeded any :(

----

## Risk Taking
##### What risks did you feel you took on this project?
* This game in general has 3 Independent moving parts that need to all work
together and seemed to be more difficult to implement than a single Player
game.

##### How do you feel about those risks?
* At this point, feeling like we may have sacrificed points to try a higher
challenge game.

## Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
* [Good Code](https://github.com/rjohnson4444/pong/blob/master/lib/ball.js#L32-L50)
- Why were you proud of this piece of code?
* Because it took the most mental energy to figure out and put into code. Although
do think it could be cleaner with refactoring.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
* [Garbage Code](https://github.com/rjohnson4444/pong/blob/master/lib/game.js#L48-L74)

###### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
* Way too many lines, duplication, tried to refactor but could not get working.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
