## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Ball bounces around screen
- 2 players each control a paddle that travels on Y axis on either end of screen
- If ball goes off end of screen of respective player, other player scores
- Ball changes trajectory based on where it impacts paddle
- First player to score 10 wins
- Lightning mode - random white flashes on screen, concealing ball temporarily
- To increase difficulty, paddle size decreases, and ball speed increases
- Power-up mode, random object placed on canvas, which if touched will increase speed of ball until it is scored
- Single player mode against a computer AI player
