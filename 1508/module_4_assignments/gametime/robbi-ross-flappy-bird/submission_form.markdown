- What risks did you feel you took on this project?
  - We feel as though building flappy bird was a risk in itself, as no one at Turing has built it before.
- How do you feel about those risks?
  - We feel good about taking the risk, because we were able to create a fully functional game without reference.

## Code Quality

[proud code](https://github.com/robbielane/flappy-bird/blob/master/lib/collision.js#L18-L58)
- Why were you proud of this piece of code?
  - We are proud of this code because we implemented it on the third day. We both think the code is very readable and clean and provides good collision detection.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[not great code](https://github.com/robbielane/flappy-bird/blob/master/lib/scoreboard.js#L6-L47)
- Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
  - We don't feel great about his piece of code because although it does the job well, it is not very DRY. It feels sloppy to read. We had some
  challenges refactoring due to the fact DOM manipulation and Firebase interaction in one function.
