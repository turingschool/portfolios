# Game Time Check In # 1

## Basics

### Team
- [RossedFort](https://github.com/rossedfort)
- [Robbie Lane](https://github.com/robbielane)

### Game Name
- Flappy Bird

### Link to the Github repository for the project
[Our Repo](https://github.com/robbielane/flappy-bird)

## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Build a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game
- The bird will be replaced by our good friend Jorge

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

- Have a boost mode that occurs when eating beans and/or burritos
- Use audio integration for Jorge's catch phrases i.e. 'Wrap up people!'
- High score tracking
- [post ideas you have here](https://github.com/robbielane/flappy-bird/issues)

### What have you accomplished so far?

- We are able to render a .png on the canvas
- We have a few basic functions that define movement i.e. moveUp, moveDown
- The character falls continually, only a spacebar press will cause it to move up
- Working on rotate

### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

- our for loop is not functioning as expected. It's executing the for loop before
the next frame of animation giving a jumping effect.

## Instructor Section

### Points for first check in (base 50)
50 points

### Instructor's goals for next check in
* Smooth out FrameRate speeds, specifically smoothing out the Jorge jump.
* Collision or Score - not the visual implementation, having the backend mechanics recognize the pipes passing.
* Background Image - including thinking about parallax scrolling.

Get the three bullets points for the 50 points next time. 60 points if all bullets and completed both collision and score backends.

### Feedback?
Discussed having FlappyJorge be an actual mode instead of the main game - thus allowing the game to make more sense to people who don't know Jorge.
