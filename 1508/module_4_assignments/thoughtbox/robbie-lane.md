### Rubric

Functionality completed. Unnecessary use of instance variables in couple of controllers. JavaScript looks good but needs to abstract a bit further and remove features from application manifest. Tests needed. Commits need to be broken in a per feature basis.

#### Main Chunk - 70 points

* 70: Application is deployed. All features are complete or some features are complete but developer showed effort to test drive coding the application. Developer worked entirely on their own for the entire application.

If above requirement is not met, grading this section is at the evaluators discretion.

### 2. Ruby Syntax & Style

* 3: Developer is able to write idiomatic and effective Ruby. Application makes good use of Object-Oriented modeling with few gaps in class identification and component extraction. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 3. Rails Style & API

* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 4. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
