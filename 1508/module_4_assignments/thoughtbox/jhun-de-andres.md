### Rubric

Project needed more time to reduce duplication, and to improve overall polish on code. Functionality is clear and naming is good. JavaScript is descriptive but could have abstract a bit further. Tests are needed. Validation of URI need to be pushed to model or PORO. Enums were not necessary.

#### Main Chunk - 60 points

* 60: Application is deployed. All features are complete or some features are complete but developer showed effort to test drive coding the application. Developer worked entirely on their own for the entire application.

------

#### Satisfactory Progress

* 2: Developer completes iterations 1 through 5 with some bugs or missing functionality.

### 2. Ruby Syntax & Style

* 3: Developer is able to write idiomatic and effective Ruby. Application makes good use of Object-Oriented modeling with few gaps in class identification and component extraction. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 3. Rails Style & API

* 2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC.  Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.

### 4. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 5. Testing

* 0: Developer does not use tests to guide development.

### 6. User Interface

* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality

### 7. Workflow

* 4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
