### Rubric

Project was test-drove. Only up to Iteration 3 completed. Tests covered integration and model tests. JavaScript still pending. Ruby and Rails style was strong. Workflow shows an effort on building small commits.

#### Main Chunk - 60 points

* 60: Application is deployed. All features are complete or some features are complete but developer showed effort to test drive coding the application. Developer worked entirely on their own for the entire application.

If above requirement is not met, grading this section is at the evaluators discretion.


------

#### Satisfactory Progress

* 1: Developer fails to complete iterations 1 through 4, or there are significant issues with delivered functionality.

### 2. Ruby Syntax & Style

* 3: Developer is able to write idiomatic and effective Ruby. Application makes good use of Object-Oriented modeling with few gaps in class identification and component extraction. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 3. Rails Style & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 4. Javascript Syntax & Style

N/A

### 5. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for *both* design and verification. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.

### 6. User Interface

* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality

### 7. Workflow

* 4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
