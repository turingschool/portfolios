# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Ratings](https://github.com/robbielane/idea_box_js/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ratings.js.es6#L3-L18)

#### Why were you proud of this piece of code?
* I originally, had a lot of repetition in this bit of code. I was able to chunk out most of the code and reuse it for both up-votes and down-votes.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sort](https://github.com/robbielane/idea_box_js/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/sort.js.es6#L1-L30)

#### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
* It was challenging to figure out a way to have the same sort link change the sort order for each consecutive click. I ended up creating a clickCount variable and then reversing the sort on odd clicks... Certainly, there is a better way.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

## Points

Good UX and functionality. Added two extensions. A bit more polish needed on tag functionality to remove unused tags and to add new tags without reloading. Testing is uneven. Monkey patching String prototype to add functionality is not recommended. Solid work overall, good quality.
