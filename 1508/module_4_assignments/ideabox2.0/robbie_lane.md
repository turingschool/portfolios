# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Ratings](https://github.com/robbielane/idea_box_js/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ratings.js.es6#L3-L18)

#### Why were you proud of this piece of code?
* I originally, had a lot of repetition in this bit of code. I was able to chunk out most of the code and reuse it for both up-votes and down-votes.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sort](https://github.com/robbielane/idea_box_js/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/sort.js.es6#L1-L30)

#### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
* It was challenging to figure out a way to have the same sort link change the sort order for each consecutive click. I ended up creating a clickCount variable and then reversing the sort on odd clicks... Certainly, there is a better way.
