## Completion

### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Yes! I am happy to say that I successfully implemented Base Functionality and delivered a use-able product.

#### If not, list what functionality is missing.

### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

Inline-Editing. I personally think that this was easier than implementing a form for each idea.

### Attach a .gif, or images of any extensions work being used on the site.

## Instructor Evaluation Points

### Specification Adherence

* **10 points**: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. There is no use of `format.js` in Rails. There is no use of unobstrusive JavaScript. There are no front-end frameworks used in the application. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### User Interface

* **3 points** - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* **8 points** - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### Ruby and Rails Quality

* **9 points** - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### JavaScript Style

* **5 points** - Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

### Workflow

* **10 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
