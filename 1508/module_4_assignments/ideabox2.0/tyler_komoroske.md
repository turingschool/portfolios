# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
#### Why were you proud of this piece of code?
[/javascripts/edit_idea.js](https://github.com/tjkomor/ideabox_js_beast/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/edit_idea.js)

I'm proud of this code because I completely restarted this project 12 hours
before it was due and I can explain each line of code in this file. I definitely
struggled a lot with this project, but when I look back, I am extremely proud of
what I was able to learn and understand in 72 hours.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
#### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
[/javascripts/render_idea.js](https://github.com/tjkomor/ideabox_js_beast/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/render_idea.js)

It took me so long how to figure out how to do this. It was extremely frustrating.
Overall, I do not feel great about the code that I did not get a chance to write. I was
really hoping to fulfill more of the base expectations, but it certainly was not
for lack of effort.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'
