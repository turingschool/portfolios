# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[My Good Code](https://github.com/MattRooney/ideabox/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/editIdea.js)
#### Why were you proud of this piece of code?
Because edit was easily the hardest of the crud functionality, and after I got past this I understood how
to approach the rest of the project much more clearly. Though it needs some refactoring.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[My bad code](https://github.com/MattRooney/ideabox/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/thumbsUpDown.js)

#### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
These two functions work and I feel like they work well. I'm proud that I got them to work but, the code is ugly. If else if else always makes
me feel guilty. Also, I know it can be refactored but I just ran out of time.
### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

## Instructor Evaluation Points

### Specification Adherence

* **10 points**: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. There is no use of `format.js` in Rails. There is no use of unobstrusive JavaScript. There are no front-end frameworks used in the application. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### User Interface

* **3 points** - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* **5 points** - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. Not all controller actions are tested. There are little or no attempts at integration testing.

### Ruby and Rails Quality

* **9 points** - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### JavaScript Style

* **5 points** - Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

### Workflow

* **10 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
