* [link to code](https://github.com/joshuajhun/ideaBox2.0/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideabox_service.js#L51-L72)
#### Why were you proud of this piece of code?
* I am proud of this code because It took me forever to really get and understand. I feel like this function really solidified the way I debug things. I was able to console log my clicks and from there really put together how to inline edit the idea name. It was a good struggle because it hit all the areas of JavaScript I wanted to get better at
### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[link to code] (https://github.com/joshuajhun/ideaBox2.0/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideabox_service.js#L95-L119)
#### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
* it's messy. I feel like there is such a better and cleaner way to implement an easy function. This method is  somethings that took me a while to get and understand.
