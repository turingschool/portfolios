## Completion

### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
HAIL YEAH!
#### If not, list what functionality is missing.

### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?
Sadly, none - next time.

### Attach a .gif, or images of any extensions work being used on the site.

# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of:
[Render](https://github.com/jillmd501/IdeaBox-JS/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideas.js#L14-L27)

#### Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I know it is strange to be proud of a render function, but if you saw what Amber and I did in our Trelora project, you would understand.  I get tripped up easily by spare '' and " ", so being able to comb through the long render function was a real confidence booster when it came to finding errors without having to debug.  While this isn't represented in a single line of code, my debugging skills in JS have skyrocketed because of this project.  I am feeling a lot more confident about having a plan when errors arise and I was able to help out a few people with it as well which is always a nice feeling. :)  I also felt like a spy trying to find the specific error since JS doesn't tell you CRAP.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

[Thumbs Up](https://github.com/jillmd501/IdeaBox-JS/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideas.js#L143-L166)

#### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I spent about 60% of the project working on thumbs up and thumbs down.  I started by saving the quality types in a variable and really struggled through moving up and down as well as rendering new words on the page.  If/else statements have haunted me since SuperFizzBuzz and I try to stay away from them.  I am hoping to work on refactoring throughout the module to improve on lengthy/verbose code.  I still have the M1 fear of breaking code while refactoring, but have gotten more comfortable as I have learned about rolling back to past commits, heroku deploys, and other methods to stave off the 'FREAK OUT.'

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'

Testing is hard.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I know it was a snowday, but I struggle with JS testing and would love some more help on that.  I also really enjoyed Steve's lesson yesterday working through specific methods and how to use them.  There is so much out there in the JS land, that I need to slow down and pick out the biggest pieces I want to get out of it.  Also wondering your thoughts on react.js?  Looking for a more front end heavy position and it seems like this is a good move.

## Instructor Evaluation Points

### Specification Adherence

* **8 points**: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. There is no use of `format.js` in Rails. There is no use of unobstrusive JavaScript. There are no front-end frameworks used in the application. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### User Interface

* **2 points** - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.

### Testing

* **8 points** - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### Ruby and Rails Quality

* **10 points** - Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and push business logic down where it belongs. There _zero_ instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.

### JavaScript Style

* **4 points** - Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

### Workflow

* **10 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
