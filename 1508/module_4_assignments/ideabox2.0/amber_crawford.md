## Completion

### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
Yes, I was able to complete functionality.

### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?
I completed all three extensions with some small functionality issues.
* Inline Editing:
  Only saves on "Enter" keydown, not by clicking out of text-box.

* Tagging: Need to refresh after filtering by tag to view all ideas again.

* Sorting: Works in both directions but, cannot use other AJAX functions after sort until refreshing page (e.g. Thumbs-Up/ Edit).

# Code Quality

### Code I am Proud of:
I am really proud of my [sort functionality](https://github.com/amcrawford/idea-box.js/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/sort_ideas.js).  It ended up being a fairly simple solution to a complex problem and was really excited to have it work out so easily.

### Code I am Not Especially Prout of:

I am not particularly excited about my solution for [changing quality](https://github.com/amcrawford/idea-box.js/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/change_quality.js).  It was one of the first methods that I wrote and, while it definitely works, I am positive there is a more elegant solution.
