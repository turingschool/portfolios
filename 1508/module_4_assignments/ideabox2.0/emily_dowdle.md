# Code Quality

This is my third time attempting a keyup filter and I finally felt like I knew exactly what I needed to do and what each piece of code was doing.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

#### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

This is an example of my code not being DRY. The AJAX call for each could be pulled out into it's own method and called from inside the function.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Overall, I think this is a strong first-go. There are parts of my code which are not DRY and should be refactored. I would also like to split the javascript functionality into different files rather than storing everything together. I did not have the opportunity to implement tests using Teaspoon â€” something I'll prioritize during the next project.
