# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
https://github.com/sekharp/ideabox_js/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideabox.js#L106-L129
#### Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I enjoyed that I was able to figure out the multiple layers of issues debugging this code and using our new debugging skills/tools. There were javascript problems, database issues and more, and now it works perfectly!

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
https://github.com/sekharp/ideabox_js/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideabox.js#L156-L200
#### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
I really felt this could've been consolidated into one, but I did not get it done in time.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

## Points

Keep an eye out for files in your commits that shouldn't be there (like generated .coffee files)! Using something like gitx to check commits and stage them in pieces would be super helpful. Good job conquering the 'JavaScript Nightmare' :D
