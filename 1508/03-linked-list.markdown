## John Senft

Assessed By: Tess

* Only completed a couple of the expectations.
* I felt what was there was OK. He just ran out of time
* Needs more tests. Needs to test edge cases and tests need to be more robust.

## Ryan Johnson

* Only didn't finish 3 methods. Did a good job with the others
* Needs to test more than the bare minimum. Also didn't have tests for all of the methods

## Shannon Paige

* Said she had more problems with git than anything else
* Recommened adding more tests to cover more cases.

## Chad Minnerath

Assessed By: Sean

* All expectations and extension was implemented
* Tests were OK, but would have liked to have seen more edge cases and thorough
  testing. For example, the tests for `includes?` still passed when the body of
  the method was replaced with `true`
* Good, but could be improved. Saw some good amounts of code reuse, for example,
  implementing `append` in terms of `find_tail`
* Style seemed fine, unsure what the responsibility of `Node` was. Classes
  should have been in multiple files. 
* Showed understanding of looping, would have liked to have seen an `each`
  method pulled out.

## Jason Pilz

Assessed By: Sean

* Two base expectations missing.
* Test coverage is pretty OK, more edge cases would have been nice to see. Spent
  time talking about stylistic nitpicks
* Some logic was moved to the node, but there was almost no code re-use within
  the list itself.
* Many long methods, code that required comments. Could be better factored
* Showed understanding of looping, but I wouldn't call it "excellent‚Äù

## Ross Edfort

Assessed By: Sean

* multiple expectations weren't implemented properly
* App was tested, but many assertions were wrong or insufficient, for example,
  the `count` function emptied the list.
* Almost no re-use of code, ultimately caused many bugs
* Indentation was inconsistent, methods were too long as a result of lack of
  encapsulation
* Showed understanding of a while loop, but not to the point I'd call it
  excellent

## Torie Joy-Warren

Assessed By: Sean

* Everything was implemented, and worked, but many functions took nodes as
  arguments or returned nodes, when they should be operating on values
* Tests were OK, but coverage of edge cases could have been better. Many tests
  contained assertions that would have passed regardless of if the behavior they
  were testing was correct.
* Defined an `each` function, but no other logic was re-used in other methods.
  Unclear what the responsibility of `Node` was.
* Style and knowledge of Ruby were fine, code could have been better factored.
* Defined an `each` function, clearly understand basic looping.
