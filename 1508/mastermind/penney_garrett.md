* Feels like she had to ask for a lot of help. Told her that as long as you attempt it yourself first and understand everything, asking for help is a good thing.
* Used a Game class. Impressed with that on no lessons with classes.
* Had long color check methods that were giant if else elsif blocks. That would be the first thing to refactor.
* Great project overall.
