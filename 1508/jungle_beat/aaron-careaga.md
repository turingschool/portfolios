Notes:

* 38 tests, all passing
* Some opportunities for refactoring
* some methods could use helper methods that were already built
* testing could use some better specificity
* testing needs to check that methods not only do what they have to do
but also that they dont mess anything up
* Playing functionality needs to be split out
* FileIO needs to be split out
* Great use of the splat
* Many opportunities to refactor and to split off code into individual
methods

Scores:

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
