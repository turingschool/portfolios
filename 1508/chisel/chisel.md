#### Penney Garrett

GitHub: https://github.com/PenneyGadget/chisel

* **Fundamental Ruby & Style**: 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
* **Test-Driven Development**: 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.
* **Functionality**: 1: Application has issues with more than one component of base expectations
* **Breaking Logic into Components**: 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

* **Functionality**: 1: Application has issues with more than one component of base expectations
* **Breaking Logic into Components**: 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility

#### Ross Edfort

* **Fundamental Ruby & Style**: 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* **Test-Driven Development**: 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.
* **Functionality**: 4: Application implements all base functionality and two extensions
* **Breaking Logic into Components**: 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
