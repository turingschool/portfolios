    notes: "bugs / inconsistent behavior through user and admin experience, check duplicated headers/footers, like to see PORO to handle order creation (push logic down the stack), remove admin logic from regular controllers, mostly good test coverage -- a little lite on model tests, check robustness of tests to ensure tests catch bugs/missing features"

    notes: "visually pleasing site. a few bumps (cart quantity of 0, cart not clearing after order). high test coverage, but would like to see more model tests. good attempt at using a PORO for order completion; make sure that actions for order creation happen atomically."
