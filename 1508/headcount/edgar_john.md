### Edgar and John

#### Evaluated by Tess
#### project url: https://github.com/slotaj/headcount

#### Notes:
 * Warned them about the bad habit of not breaking out classes into separate files
 * Focused on the test harness once they realized that it was a thing. Their own tests suffered as a result

#### Overall functionality: 
 * 3: Completes the Data Access Layer

#### Enumerables: 
 * 2

#### Fundamental Ruby:
 * 2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

#### TDD:
 * 2: If I edit the code to be broken, then a test fails (in other words, the tests prove that the code is correct by failing when I add bugs to the code)

#### Breaking Logic into Components:
 * 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities + 1 from influence point
