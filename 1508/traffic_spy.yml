       notes: "full functionality + two extensions; good use of parser objects; good separation of web and business logic; would like to see fewer instance variables sent to views"

       notes: Some views are instantiating new objects within them. Need to pull out logic down the stack. Only on one page - so score is still 3 but should be aware it's not good practice. Scores for views and business logic are threes, but were close to twos because of the business logic in views.

     setup_notes: one issue with sending payloads at first. Problem solved id should be identifier.
     instructor_evaluation:
       notes: One issue - mentioned above - Views are clean and contain no logic. Server(controller) is really clean. Great use of poros. Error page can be more specific to the issue.

       notes: Controller has more logic than desirable. Particularly "get "/sources/:identifier/events/:event_name"". Logic could have been separated more with POROS. Too many instance vairables in the controller, but no logic in views. Needs to utilize more active record. Too much ruby enumerables.

     setup_notes: issue with error page because of merge conflict. Fixed.
     instructor_evaluation:
       notes: Overall good work. Server(controller) could be a little skinnier but made good use of POROs. Testing was good too, make sure to test all AR models for validations. Continue to TDD. Be careful of nameing variables. Be a little more robust with feature tests - click through some functionality. Great use of scoping feature tests.
