Notes:

* Separate directories for encrypt, decrypt, and crack. Essentially 3 separate projects.
* Some methods not covered in unit testing.
* Some long methods and opportunities for refactoring and consolidating code into slightly
more readable portions.
* Project was fully completed.
* Good testing, covered edge cases in many places.
* Cracking calculated the key, and was not a brute force approach.

Evaluated By:

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application follows the complete spec and can crack a 100-character message in under 1 second

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
