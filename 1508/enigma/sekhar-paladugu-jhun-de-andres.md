Notes:

* 49 tests.
* Some long methods, some opportunities for refactoring.
* Tests could use some edge case testing, and additional unit tests.
* Project complete, cracks in under a second.
* All features work.
* Constants could have been used more
* Decrypt/Encrypt and portions of crack could be pulled out and combined to
a single class.
* File IO could be its own class.
